in addition to the sessions, Ihe festival
will have four workshops, on topics such as
how to wrile a business article, or a movie
script around a business idea. Paramanand
says that there are many businesspeople

provide them with sortie tools that might
come in handy. Shankar P., a festival director, and editor of the business journal

The workshop on screenwriting is the
only event thathas an entry fee (11.000).
Anium Rajabali, who will conduct the workshop, says: “For a long time, the lndian film
industry avoided making movies on issues
like business and technology. The thinking
was that these are dry subjects and not

thinking is changing slowly, he says, and
the industry is looking for new stories.
