Gayatri began the recital

with a Surya kautvarn. a
prayer to sun god. one who
offers liberation from
darkness. This was followed
by a varnarri which

Gayatri did not stop with
identifying devotion as the
route to liberation. She went
a step ahead and interpreted
devotion too in various
ways. For instance. she used
rati shn'ngara in both the
variiarn and the Jayadeva
piece as a reading of bhakti.
Kuru Yadunandana,
especially, stood out in this
regard. Can you seek the
affection of the lord even
after a union with him,

performed in the most
assured and competent
manner. As I walked away
from the performance. what
struck me was the fact that
the strength and clarity in
Gayatri‘s dancing and the
joy that emanated from it
was indeed an extension of
who Gayatri was, as a
pe rson.
The previous day, Gayatri
had told me that the roots of
her optimistic demeanour lie

parents and her husband,

chicken and egg situation.
Everyone wants to know
where you've danced before

to perform but how do you

So is it necessary for a
dancer to juggle all these
different roles today? "No.

dancers is tough. In a ﬁeld

Gayatri's dictum both for
herself and her students is
that dance is not a hobby
and should never be done
half-heartedly. “I tell my
students that they shouldn't
join my class if they are not
ready to treat their dance at
par With their academics.
Dance is too all
encompassing,” she added.
Havingsaid that. it is not
like her idealism is not
rooted in reality. Gayatri
does not shy away from
describing a life in dance as
a struggle, “There are lots of
platforms today. But there
are also that many dancers.
So the challenges are plenty.
