DETAILED ArtistSrinlbas has portrayed urban d wailing and its inhabitants in myriad hues.

P1rom the picturesque
landscapes of Spiti and
the colourfulBuddhist
prayer ﬂags found in abundance there, to the congested
by-lanes of urban dwellings
likeDelhi, Lucknow and
- Odisha, artist Srinibas’ canvases highlight vignettes of a particular area, painting a vivid
pictureof an entire place he
wants you to see throughhis
intricatebrush strokes.
“This is my fourth show,
and for this I wanted to present the emotion of a place. Using elements native to a particular place, I have tried to
build an entire city, town or
state on my canvas through
colours that are soothing
yetgive out a strong feel
of the place,” Srinibas, who

prefers using his ﬁrst name,
tells Metrolz’fe.
His works, numbering 24,
were recently displayed in the
cityunder a solo exhibition titled ‘Extended Vision' at the
Triveni Kala Sangam.
Interestingly, his canvases
portray his subjects from a
distance, giving it a zoomedout effect. Ask him the reason
and the artist says, “You get to
know a person better if you
observe him from a distance.
Same is the case with cities.
You do not realise its beauty
and importance ifyou stay too
close to it. Step back and you
will see the difference. That is
exactly the kind of view I have
ﬂied to give the viewers so
that they understand the
subject better.”

The canvases bearingportraits ofcities capturing their
beauty during different times
during a day are interspersed
with paintings of human ﬁgures. Explaining the idea behind putting them together,
Srinibas says that nature and
its creations go best together.

“Human beings are na—
ture’s most sensitive and best
creation. If you notice, the human ﬁgures in my works are
surrounded by unconscious
shapes — something which is
within each one of us,” the
artist says pointing to one
such work.

“All of us have such shapes
within us which are taken
from the formative shapes we
encounter in our everyday
lives. I have strewn the canvas
featuring human ﬁgures With
such shapes so that my audience instantlycormects with
the works," he adds.
However, all his exhibited
works — mix mediaon paper
and acrylic on canvas ~ are untitled. Sharing the idea. he
smiles and says, "Had I titled
my works, the audience would
have seen them through my
eyes. They would have perhaps seen it the way I would
have wanted them to. Keeping
them untitled. gives my viewers a space to interpret the
work in a way they want to."
