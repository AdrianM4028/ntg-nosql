performance. Chenda,

maddalam and edakka are the
powerful drums that
accompany chengila as well as
the actors’ movements. When
chenda leaves areas of pause in
percussion, they are ﬁlled in by
maddalam, which also
synchronises the pitch.
Melappadam is a distinct
segment wherein the scene is
enacted with only percussive
accompaniment, sans vocals.
Each pure nritta sequence
called kalaasam is structured
by rhythmic syllables called
vaythari silently chanted by
the actor. Ashtakalaasam is a
particular sequence of
kalaasams performed at select
points of the narrative. To
illustrate, artist

impersonation. A few
Chinese army generals
stumble upon a person
who resembles the
Indian Prime Minister —
Raveendra, and teach

him Raveendra’s
mannerism. The idea is
that when the Indian PM
visits China, he will be

temporarily replaced by
the fake. Once the press
conference is over, with

the fake announcing
unthinkable concessions
to China, the original will

be brought back. The
presumption is that the

wouldn’t have mattered
if Sreevatson had
stopped there. It is
nobody’s argument that
politicians or public
figures should not be
lampooned. But it isn’t
decent to talk about their
personal lives. Dragging
in the Prime Minister's
wife and talking about
his marriage left a bad
taste in the mouth.

Sreevatson announced
before the play began,
that in all his plays, the
Tamil content was less

than the English content.
That being the case,
perhaps, Sreevatson
should position himself
in the English theatre
scene instead of in Tamil
theatre.
