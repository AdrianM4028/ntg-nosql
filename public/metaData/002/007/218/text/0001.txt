Sethunath gavbé/brief explanation of the technical aspects for
performing Kathakali in his lec-dem. Lalithaa Krishnan elaborates.
athakali is a

complex
amalgam ofstory,
dance, theatre,

poetry, vocals and
percussion, each component

governed bywell-deﬁned rules
that date back to the 17th
century. Therefore, it is

advisable to do one’s
homework before viewing a
performance. Informed
appreciation on the part of
rasikas contributes towards
their gradual understanding of
this ancient art form that basks

movements (kinetics), body
language (kinesics),
performance methods,

costumes and make-up
(aharya). The stories enacted
are written in compliance with
the generic structure and the

movement (chulippu)

accompanies each mudra to
constitute the grammar to

upanga sadhakas (eyes,

which navarasa is added. There
are two Kathakali styles in
vogue — the northern
Kalluvazhi chitta and the
southern Kaplingadan style.
The base rhythm (tala) is
controlled by the lead singer
Ponnani, using a gong

tharam (minor roles) and ida

and accompanied by the

norms, with the same scheme

followed in the rendition. For
the actor-dancers, the rigorous
training progresses from basic
mudras, primary steps and
