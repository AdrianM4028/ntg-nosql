३ The Art ofKeeping it Short

n 2009, Cyrus Dastur./
I the
Mumbai—hased
founder of the Shami—
ana Short Film Club, had
gone to Kolkata. He was
showcasing a few short
ﬁlms at the Nandan theatre. After the show was
, over, a group of college students came up and had a
chat with Cyrus.
Two years later, one ofthe
girls, ShivaniParekh (name
. changed), called Cyrus and
told her that when she had
attended the screening, she
had been studying science.
But, inspired by the ﬁlms
she saw, Shivani began to
study ﬁlm-making. “It was
a life-changing moment for
Shivani,” says Cyrus. “That
was when I realised that
Shamiana was having an
impact on people.”
Cyrus, a long-time thea—
tre actor, started the club .
on June 7, 2008. His logic
was simple. “For feature
ﬁlms, there are cinema
halls, TV channels, and
ﬁlm festivals,” says Cyrus,
“But for short ﬁlms, there
is practically no outlet, except for a few ﬁlm societies, which are few and far
between. So I decided to set
up a platform where short
ﬁlm—makers can showcase
their works, in front of a
discerning audience.”

Interestingly, there are no
membership fees. Instead,
the club depends on spon—
sors. Apart from halls, the
ﬁlms are shown at restaurants and cafes. “These venues are given free to the club
because they get more business, thanks to increased
footfalls,” says @rus.
A wide variety of ﬁlms
from all over the world, including Oscar-nominated
ones, are shown. One of the

ace footballer Lionel Messi,
Hamoudi has a passion to
play the game with a lo—

cal club in Baghdad. “The
19-minute ﬁlm shows how
violence has not curbed the
Iraqi children‘s passion for
the game," says Cyrus.

Asked abour the beneﬁts
of showing a ﬁlm at the
club, Cyrus says, “A ﬁlm-

maker is able to physically meet with members
of the audience, and get a
feedback. This helps him
or her to become a better
ﬁlm—maker.” '
Recently, Cyrus held a
short ﬁlm festival at the J'I‘
Pac, Kochi, which had entries from all over the coun— ’

try. “The ﬁlms are so much ।
better now, in terms of production, camera technique,
and the understanding of ‘
the medium," he says. “And '
that is good news. We need
a lot of meaningful art and
story—telling in these intolerant times.”
