performance, creating a
portrait highly charged with

the auspices of Routes 2

Roots devoted to the
promotion ofpeaceful
coexistence among people of

the world through the arts at
Kamani auditorium this past
week will be remembered for
its innovative artistry,

multiple shades of colour and
inspired performances by the
cast. It was a festival that

confronting brute state force,

celebrated peace, friendship
दृ and human values. The

chorus rendered with heartfelt intensity with the
accompanied beats of drums
and suggestive décor created
an aura of magic on the stage.
The festival opened with
the presentation of “Bulha”

which provided insights into
the life and time ofmystic
saints through music, dance

and drama. His was the time
of religious intolerance,
social and political anarchy.
In the midst of this violence
“Bulha” and his mentor try to
apply balm to the wounds of
afflicted humanity through
their spiritual message.
Written by Shahid
Nadeem, eminent playwright
and theatre personality of
Pakistan, the play is directed
byMadeeha Gauhar. Though

on shiftingfrom one locale to
another, the director has

blended various theatrical
expressive means — music,
.dance, drama and lighting —
to ensure the cohesive and
logical thrust of the narrative
to a climax that has a soul
stirring effect.
The production is superbly
cast throughout, displaying
eXCellent acting, dancing and
singing talents imparting a
great deal ofvitality to the
production. In the lead role
of Bulha, Usman Raj gave a
memorable performance. His
Bulha was self-effacing in his
quest for truth and craving to
be one with the supreme
divine power. Once his
mentor Shah Inahat became

his unorthodox political
philosophy provided grounds
for theologians to condemn
him to death to please
Aurangzeb. Among Indian
directors S.M. Sathyu’s
version was remarkable for
deeper insights into the
tragic life and the historical
forces at work that led to the
defeat of Dara.
Shahid’s production stood
out for its interpretation of
history in terms of
antagonistic confrontation
between the forces of
religious intolerance and the
mysticism of the Suﬁs that
espouse the cause of

Singh Bahadur, who has his

own sense ofjustice and is
ﬁghting for it and Sohail
'I‘ariq as Shah Inayat created
striking images of their
characters.
The second offering of
Ajoka was “Dara” which was
shown in India earlier also.

theatre practitioners in India

his innate spiritual prowess
came to the fore. In fact, he
dominated street scenes
which depict the insult and
humiliations inﬂicted on
Dara as prisoner. Shahid’s
production gave adequate
space to the masses and their
reactions to the plotting and
counter-plotting of the ruling
class, engaged in bloody war
for the crown.
In 2012 we saw a large
number of stage adaptations
of short stories bySaadat
Hasan Manto produced by
amateur as well as seasoned
directors with varying
success to markthe birth
centenary of the writer.
Ajoka has once againbrought
his “Kaun Hai Yeh Gustakh”
to India. Written' by Shah‘id
Nadeem and directedby
Madeeha, the production was
imaginatively designed with
enough space for the action
that moved to varipus
locations and different

situations between the past
and the present. We watched
a shattered image of the story
writer who was forced to
leave Bombaywhich he once
loved, called his home which

in turn made him his darling.
He was in Pakistan now.
One by one heart-rending
story related to genocide that
took place in the wake of the
Partition are enacted on the
centrestage. The horror and
blood-bath during the
Partition was dissected with
the starkness of the scalpel of
a surgeon which left the
audience stunned.
The most noteworthy
aspect of the production was
the effective use of
Bollywood’s melodious songs
of golden era, not intended to
entertain but to recreate the

sense ofhistory, time and
space as well as to evoke
emotional background for
the action. These songs were
played almost in a low pitch
just to provide background.
Usman Raj as Saadat Hasan
Manto in this realistic format
gave a highly credible
performance, bringing to the
light the tormented inner
world of the writer out of
tune of disjointed world with
telling effect.
The festival came to an end
with the presentation of “L0
Phir Basant Ayee”. Written
by Shahid and directed by
Madeeha, the production was
a celebration oflife, evoking
a mood ofjoyous excitement.
