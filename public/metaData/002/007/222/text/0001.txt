Play Aap

Hamare

Hain

Kaun’ shakes parents, educa-

tionists/guardians of society out
of reverie of materialism, con-

sumerism and unbridled desires.
This play compels elders to look
around and clear the mess they
. have created due to their own
" amorous ambitions and rat race.
दृ Parents see in their children an
extension of their unfulﬁlled
] dreams and force them to ‘

हैं' become stereotypes and kill the
J bountiful charm in them. In a
1 pursuit to make them top profes%sionals, doctors, engineers and
। civil servants, they are subjected

‘ to every kind of cruelty. The
ट्वे children become mechanical and
दृ hardly get time to discover their

real self. Prevalent educational
system adds further insult to the
injury and their creativity gets
scuttled and children grow up
devoid of values.
The proud Jammu children
who are going to be a part of this
history in making include Juhi

Shivangini

Sharma,

Divyan

Sharma, Sahil Singh Anand,
Vedhant Suri, Sanket Bhagat and

Eudra Kohli.
