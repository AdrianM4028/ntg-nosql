EnFlightenment, a solo devised comedy piece, directed
by Ulf Evren and presented at
The Parks New Festival Edi३ tion IX.
Rupesh 'I‘illu, who holds an
MFA in physical comedy from
The National School of Dramatic Arts, Sweden, is the star
act. His performance, drawn

he adventures from Poland to
Jerusalem to the economic
_ corridors of Wall Street. His
misadventures make him question if we are all truly free, or if
we are merely puppets dancing
to someone’s tune. If so,
whose? While in pursuit ofthat
answer, he comments on society, consumerism and capitalism, among other things, and
poses larger spiritual and existential questions. The lights
(Asmit

Pathare),

combined

with the movements, give the
show a slick look, and the music (Karthik Ramaswamy) is

remarkably on cue. The performance is absurd in some
parts, abstract in a few others.
It is also a tad tedious because
of the length. What is interest-

ing, however, is the mood the

performer paints and his easy
physicality, which allows him
to ddn the shades of 20 characters, dance, sprint around and
accommodate over half-a-doz-

en costume changes. Yet, in
one scene, even as sweat trickles down his face, he manages
to convince his audience he is

freezing to the bone. His physical command is outstanding,
and the use of mime, clowning
techniques and magic tricks
