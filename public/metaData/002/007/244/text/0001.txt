M Story of the Mahatma
he sits and contemS plates. Knotting her
eyebrows together,
she subsequently shifts
from her seated position.
It’s time to stop think—
ing, and start rehears—
ing. Precious moments
have gone by in deep
thought contemplat—
ing over the ‘ugly face of
caste discrimination still
prevalent in the country.
“What kind of human
rights do we talk about?”
she asks her self, not sure
whether she’ll ever ﬁnd

key concepts from his

an answer. Pushing away

spotlighted this decades

the disturbing thought,
she decides to centre her
focus on the Mahatma,
and all the times he
walked on lonely road to
ﬁght this deplorable reality. Taking refuge in his
efforts, classical dancer
Geeta Chandran is all set
to enact some of
Gandhi’s stories
through her
dance—theatre
production
called Gandhi:
Warp and
Weft.
Being organised on the
occasion of the
‘ 60th anniversary
of Springdales
School on October 1, she says
the aim is to
explore

philosophy through the
narrative lens of a female
dancer in the 21st centu—
ry. “My favourite section
in the production is when
it speaks of caste discrimination and focuses
on the heinous crime

of manual scavenging
that persists even today.
Despite all our human
rights regulations and
court judgements, human
beings still are called to
remove excreta. This is

unpardonable. Gandhi

ago, and we are yet to
come to grips with solv—

ing this. In our ‘Swachch
Bharat’ mission, manual
scavenging should be at
the forefront,” she says.
Abstract movement

are interspersed with

animated gestures em—
bellishing the story line.
Bharatanatyam and con-

temporary movements
have been combined to
present six concepts. “In
keeping with Gandhi’s
personal evolution, the
_ initi a1 sections of the
choreography are based
on classical Bharatan-

atyarn abhinaya techniques. The newness of
his evolving philosophy
and the stark brilliance of
his struggle are demon—
strated through the later
sections that have been
visualised embracing
a more contemporary

choreographic outlook,”

She says, believing that
it’s a style of story—
telling that children will
understand and imbibe.
Once that happens, the
performance will be a

success, she says.
