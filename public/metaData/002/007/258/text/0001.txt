What is Chhau?
humikeshwar said that
B Chhau dance owed
most of its glory to a Seraikela king named, Aditya
Pratap Singhdev, who improved the presentation and
technique of this dance. “He
created the first rules of the
Seraikela Chhau dance, and
also wrote most of the 200300
stories that exist today in
this dance form, ” he said. He
added that most stories in
Chhau are short, and last for
5-10 minutes. “Keeping all
these stories in mind, the
king divided Chhau into
three basic parts — Chali
(imitation of movements of
people, trees and animals),
Upsli (actions inspired from
chores of the common people) and Khel (art of weapons
use). To master all this, one
has to undergo training and
practice.
