CM — to the uninitiated,
that’s Imrov Comedy
Mumbai ~— is set to put the
audience in the director’s seat
for HeistGeist, a long form version of their routine. All that is

fixed in this show is that a
group of thieves band together

to pull off a heist. Where the
story goes from there, is all up
to you. Give the actors cues
and watch them perform
improv magic.
