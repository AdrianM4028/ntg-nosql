based on a story of renowned
Hindi writer Udai Prakash.
The story moves around a
person named Mousaji, an old
man who has woven an imagi-

nary world around him. He
has all the problems of a cornmon poor man but he always
talks about his participation
in freedom struggle. his
friendship with Gandhi Ji,
how angrejsahabs were afraid
of him in those days and how
the chief minister and police
chief still respect him. People
know him and his reality but
still love him for his simplicity
and honesty. Mousaji compels
us to think about him and his
own world. The play ends
with Mousaji being compelled
to accept the reality of life.
The Hriday Munch willtake
placefrom August 27 to August 30 at the Shri Ram Centre Safdar Has/1171i Marg,
