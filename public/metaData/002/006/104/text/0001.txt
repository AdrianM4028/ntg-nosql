director Prof Waman Kendre
— has decided to open up NSD
in various areas in northeast.
NSDs have already been set
up in Tripura, Nagaland and
Mizorum, and now we are opening an NSD in Assam.”
Talking about lack of a state
drama schoolin Bunjab, he said:
“I wonder why the state government isn’t sparing some fundfor
setting up of Punjab School of
Drama (PSD). It needs around
र5 crore to start a drama school,
which is the need of hour, as
theater has ﬂourished in Punjab
and has reached to the international level. The only thing
needed is backing of the state
government.”

Adding to it, he said, “The
PSD will be a success, as there
are eminent theatre personali-

ties such asJatinder Brar; Kewal
Dhaliwal, Neelam Mansingh
Choudhary. Gurcharan Singh

Charm who should be appointed
as faculty for PSD, which will
also provide a means of liveli»
hood to the youth of Punjab.“
The situation is so precarious
that theSangeet NatakAkadem i
Award recipient gets only २10

lakh and the NSD is getting
३70 crore per year to organise
events ~ the budget is too paltry and it should be increased,
he said.
Another problem is the posts
for dramatics are lying vacant
as no big theatre personality
such as Nawazudin Siddiqui
wants to be an academician,
he said, adding why would he
leave the ﬁlm industry and join
teaching as he was earning good
there.
“But NSD students should
come forward to be at least
a guest faculty and the same
should be‘ the cas for the PSD."
he added.
