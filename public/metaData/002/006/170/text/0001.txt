AMRITSAR, AUGUST 22
Catching up with the contemporary theatrics while
traditional theatre in tow,
Amritsar has managed to
prep a fresh audience and
more room for experimentation in its theatre circle.
And the efforts have not
gone,
unnoticed.
The

National School of Drama
(NSD) has made its presence felt in the city through
collaborations and workshops. But now, the premier

institute of acting and
direction wants to expand
its base in the region.
In the city to announce
the l ﬁrst-ever Poorvottar
Rashtriya Rang Utsav, rioted theatre and television
director and member of faculty, NSD, Suresh Bhardwaj' shared some plans to
increase their focus on theatre talent in the region.
“A‘mritsar is the most significant centre of theatre
activity in Punjab and has a
long history of producing
brilliant theatre talent. We
recognised the potential of
the holy city as a major cen—
tre for theatre while organising the Bharat Rang
Mahotsav here, which is
now' known in the international theatre circuit. Since
then, we have planned to
shift our focus to northern

regions,” Bhardwaj said.
Laying emphasis on making regional theatre more
visible, he said Amritsar
could serve as a common
ground for artistes from
Jammu
and Kashmir,
Himachal
Pradesh,
Haryana and Rajasthan for
increased interaction.
“The city has a good temperament and audience for
theatre along with the infrastructure. At present, a lot
of theatre groups come to
the city for festivals and
workshops," he said.
He also credits the Punjabi theatre for reaching out
globally with its roots
intact.

“Punjabi theatre has trav—
eled all across the world
and identifies with its folk
traditions. Be it the Punjabi
language, folk music and
dance forms like bhangra
or its folklores, the Punjabi
theatre has a glimpse of its
culture. We want every
region to capitalise on their
folk art forms through theatre just like Punjab has
done,” Bhardwaj said.
The NSD, which now is
among top 10 schools in the
world in the field of creative
and performing arts, is also
planning to create regional
centres ofexcellence covering four corners of the
country. The school is supported by the Ministry of
Cultural Affairs and gets a
funding close to Rs 65 crore
every year.
“We have made a blueprint for expanding operations in several parts of the
country, including Jammu
and Kashmir, Kerala, Orissa and Gujarat, which we
plan tobegin by early 2016.
We want to create zonalcentres that impart best theatre education and promote
regional
folk
theatre,”
he said.
‘
The NSD already runs
three regional centres at
Bengaluru, Gangtok and
Agartala with one year certificate course in different
aspects oftheatre. -
