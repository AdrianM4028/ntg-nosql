theatres. I went to watch the
last show of Highway in
Patiala. I wanted see the man
who was going to bemy son
in Beeba Boys. It goes without saying the ﬁlm was great
and sowere the actors in it.
Deepa is a hard task inaster. She knows exactly what
she wants in each scene and
is able to get her vision.

Jeet (Randeep Hooda) loves सू
his mother. He respects ‘
women in general and does
not kill them. He loves his
girlfriend. He is a good father: ५
There are no rapes or gang
rapes in the movie. You feel
that they are in many ways ३
good people set on the wrong
path. You kind ofwonder how
these Beeba Boys would have
been, had they not been at
the wrong place and wrong
time to be lured into this
gangster life style. .

What's your take on Beeba Boys?
What's about it you like the best?
Ihave read quitea few scripts
on gangsters and watched a
couple ofmovies. The thing I
like the most about Beeba
Boys is the complexity of

How well did you bond with
Randeep Hooda?
I had gone to 'Ibronto for the
workshop. Deepa called me
to ask me if I would like to
join them for a party that one
of her friends had thrown for
her. She told me that Neelam
Man Singh would be there
and also I would get the
chance to meet Randeep
informally. So I went. When
Randeep came, I went to him
(he did not know who I was)
and I told him that I didn’t
think I needed permission to
hug my son and gave him a
hug.We wereconnected from
that time and still are like
mother and son. Most of my
scenes are with Randeep,
who is a great person to work
with. Wehad a very goodrelationship as mother and son.
He is very genuine, helpful
and supportive.
