ahitya Akaderni Award
Srecipient Anita Nair is a
globetrotting author
whose novels, translated

into 30 languages, havewon
her accolades in France,
Spain and other countries.
But no matter how many
oceans she crosses, Nair

always comes back to her
tongue-twister of village in
Kerala where she has a little house with a leaky roof.
This is the world in which she creates her imaginary
worlds. What many don’t know is that Nair also owns
a property which has the village post office. And she
earns a princely sum of Rs 50 as rent. Now, you may
want to try saying Mundakkottukurussi.
