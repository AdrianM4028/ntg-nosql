Padamsee’s next
production celebrates the 100th
year of Mahatma
Gandhi’s return from South
Africa, and is replete with
social undercurrents. “It’s a
movement to bring Gandhi
and his ideals back,” says
Padamsee, as she excitedly
tells us about the project,
titled Mahatma, which also
happens to be the biggest production, in terms of the cast,
that she has ever been part of.
The theme of the drama is
also in line With Prime
Minister Narendra Modi’s

Swachh Bharat Abhryan.
Apparently, it took more
than seven months to put
this production together:
Throughout the rehearsals,
there were several activities

conducted to instill values
of teamwork, self-reliance and
non-violence in the kids.
“We’ve tried to take this
message to children all over
by distributing 30,000 art
sheets to schools, from Colaba
to Powai. We encouraged the
kids to draw what freedom
means to them,” says
Padamsee.
The production features
around 300 child artistes
from across the city. To bring
talent together from various
social strata, Padamsee’s
theatre company associated

“Having worked with
these NGOs on our other
productions, we’ve seen
exactly how talented their
children are. We wanted

Mahatma to not just be a celebration of our independence,
but also an embodiment
of our effort to make India a
free country in the true sense.
We have tried to break down
social and economic barriers
by getting children from eight
NGOs, and some others from
mainstream schools to perform together, providing an

equal opportunity to all,"
says Padamsee.
However. due to logistical
issues, and the size of the
cast, the play will not be
travelling to other cities.
“It’s too big a production.

But we have tied up with
Doordarshan, and will
hopefully broadcast it soon,"
says Padamsee.
