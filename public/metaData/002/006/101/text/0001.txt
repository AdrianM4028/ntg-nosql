hen translated to
English, the play
titled Gudiya
Ghar means Doll
House, quite literally But the
Hindi adaptation of this
classic play by Norwegian
playwright Henrik Ibsen is
not the only one that is
being staged in the Capital to
touch the hearts of
Hindi-theatre audiences.
The four-day theatre
festival titledHriday Manch,

is back with its fourth edition
this year. “We started this
festival in 2012 becausewe

wanted to attract those who
are not avid followers of
theatre. That is why we chose
plays which have universal
themes and canentertain the
audience," says Ajit

Chowdhury, director; Sparsh
Natya Rang — the group
organising the festival.
While Gudiya Ghar will be
staged by Delhi-based group
New Delhi Players, another
play, Mousaji Jai Hind will be
presented by theatre group
Vivechana from Jabalpur
(Madhya Pradesh).
Chowdhury says, “We try to
keep an elementof folk in .
our festival every year It is
our effort to encourage
1
the art of theatrics that
is peculiar to our
country’s heritage since
time immemorial."
The play from Jabalpur
is based on the life of the
renowned Hindi writer, Udai
Prakash. The central
character is of an old man
who always talks about his
participation in India’s
freedom struggle, his

friendship with Gandhiji, and
how the chief minister and
police still respect him
Alongside these plays, the

festival will also see the
staging of the plays Mayaran
Ki Maya by Rangbhoomi ant
Pati Gaye Ree Kathiawar by
the hosts. The former is bastd
on a popular folktale that
explores how humans, at
times, overlook the existent»
of God, The latter is a funny
take on the quotient of faith
in a man-woman relationsth
