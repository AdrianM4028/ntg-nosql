My Modern Met, the paintings are so detailed that you c u
see every freckle, every lash or strand of hair on their
faces. Even their clothing is intricately represented,
adding texture to the piece. “I put my entire life into ’ "
the artist admitted on his Instagram account. A preCise
set of tools is required for such meticulous strokes, and
takes him a long time to complete one painting. But the
final product is so awe-inspiring that we can almost see
the subject walk out of the painting.
