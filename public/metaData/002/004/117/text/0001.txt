Delhi l Bengaluru:

Eminent writers and scientists who have been returning
awards to protest against
what they say is rising intolerance in the country have responded with mixed reactions to home minister
Rajnath Singh’s offer to discuss their concerns.
On Monday, in an interview
to ET, Rajnath Singh had extended an open invitation for
dialogue with artistes and scientists
returning
their
awards, saying he was willing
to “sit a whole day” to discuss
their concerns on intolerance.
“I am ready. to set aside everything else and sit down a whole
day with them. I will welcome
them to come and highlight the
reasons they feel have given

rise to intolerance.” Singh,
however; questioned why
awardsweren’t returned when
bigger communal riots took
, place under different govern‘ ments in the country. “Still, if
they feel, I think, in a democracy we must have a discussion.”

Eminent writer Nayantara Sahgal, whose returning of
her Sahitya Akademi Award
on October 6 in a way triggered the movement, said the '
“Prime minister and not Rajnath Singh” needs to address
the concerns being voiced collectively by many sections of
people. “The whole country——
historians, artists, writers,
students,

scientists—

are

waiting for the PM to speak.

A similar View was espoused
byBharat Ratna scientistCNR
Rao who said, “I think the

Prime Minister should hold a
dialogue with litterateurs and
scientists and all the otherpeople talking about this issue
rather than Rajnath Singh. ”
Several others, however;
have
welcomed
Rajnath
Singh’s offer. Noted litterateur Shashi Deshpande, who
resigned from the Sahitya
Akademi General Council last
month, said it was never too
late to talk about issues. “I welcome the move for dialogue.”
Punjabi writer Surjit Patar
said it was a welcome change
that “the government is ﬁnally willing to acknowledge that
there was something going
wrong... There is nothing
wrong in talking.”
