THE WEEKj_NQ\[EMBER 15, 29];

That tinny tolerance
hat happens to a soci-

ety when fear runs
amok and silence prevails upon us all? Even our conscience falls prey to this heinous
muted state of self censorship,

fearful of the consequences of
voicing one’s opinions, thoughts,
feelings and even doubts.
When we shy away from arguing even with those we consider
our friends, for fear of what? Of

the futility of it all? For fear of
losing their friendship? For fear
of not being understood? For fear
that they may betray us?
When the conscience keepers of
our society—the artists, the intellectuals, the academics and the sci-

entists who are capable of showing
us the world in a different light, en-

abling us to see the truth, however
uncomfortable, painful and yet

beautiful—fall prey to this silence,
can we call ourselves civilised?
Modern? Advanced? World-class?
First World? India Shining?
What is this great journey
towards progress all about? Is it
really about being a progressive
society? Or is it about losing our
humanity?
I do not want this progress, this
development. I do not want to
live in fear. I do not want my son
to grow up in an India where we
cannot speak our minds or ques—
tion those around us. An India
where my son’s grandaunt, Romila
’I‘hapar, who has been giving public
lectures and teaching for 60 years,
has to receive police protection at

There is a vague comforting famil-

and all those who utter words of
discrimination and bigotry. I want
a reassurance that my voice and
the world of artistic expression in
India are valued, and our differ—

iarity even in the non-familiar.
I celebrate the fact that I belong

to a culture that tells stories
through metaphors and symbols.
And, today, is it not ironical that

ences are respected.

I do not want my loyalty to be
questioned because I have another
opinion or belief system. I want to
be able to make political statements without having to be slotted
into base party politics and called

names. I want to live without fear.
And, it is not a platitude. I, too,
have lived in fear and still do.
Let us replace the word tolerance
with respect and create a world
where there is respect for life, respect for diversity, and respect for
debate and argument. And the only
place ‘tolerance’ should have in our
lives is in complete ‘intolerance’ of

any form of Violence.
