AMRI'I‘SAR, NOVEMBER 1
Known for his sensitive and
realistic portrayal of stories,
fictional as well as real-life,
on the stage, celebrated theatre director and actor Kew—
a1 Dhaliwal has always given the audience something
to think about. Whether it is
the re-invention of Sadat
Hasan Manto with his play
“Ik Si Manto” or telling the
fateful story of the victims
of Korna Gata Maru with his
play of the same title, Dhaliwal has always preferred to
tell real-life inspiring stories for the generations to
reminiscent and recognise.
Continuing with his concept of re-inventing true
stories of history for theatre’s cause, Dhaliwal’s
upcoming productions too
will bring out stories lost in
mayhem of time for the
younger audience.
His current play “Kachi
Garhi” is based on the Satnami movement in seventeenth century, when a sect
of saints led a revolution
against the Mughal Empire
under the rule ofAurangzeb.

The costume-drama is being
staged in a series of shows

and Chandigarh. He is also
planning a play on the life of
Nora Richards, the Irish
actress and theatre patron,
who produced the ﬁrst Punjabi play “Dulhan” in 1914,
written by her student Ishwar Chand Nanda.
“She was one of the

biggest influences on Punjabi theatre’s promotion
during the British Raj. She
is responsible to nurture talents like Balwant Gargi, IC
Nanda
and
Gurcharan
Singh, who went on to
become stalwarts of Punjabi
theatre movement later. I
am planning a tribute to her
in form a biographical drama that will tell this genera-

tion about her grit and dedication towards Punjab and
its culture,” says Dhaliwal.
He has a long list of historical plays, including “Mera
Rang De Basanti Chola"
based on Shaheed Bhagat
Singh’s
life,

Baisakhi” about Jallianwala
