e morning concert by

opular vocalist S Shankar
on Vijayadashami'at Sri
Avani Math, Basaveshwaranagar, proved delightful from start to ﬁnish for many reasons. 'Ihe lyrics of the well-known
songs in his recital hit several high
notes, enthralling the audience. Precision and vibrancy were the highlights
of the performance by Shankar and
his son S Rarnani. The duo sang Kedaragowla vama and Gajavadana
(Hamsadhwani). Musicality and dramatic mood changes throughout the
performance made it a pleasant performance.
Bhairavi Swarajathi by Shyama
Sastry, in praise of Goddess Kamakshi, is both demanding anddelightful.

Set to misra chapu taala, an unhurried
tempo, it has an interesting structure
with eight charanas or sections. Each
charana is renderedin swara—sahitya
format. The pallavi begins in mandra
shadja. The otherseven charanas start
with the next sequential swara of the
scale of the raga in ascending order
-- rishabha, gandhara and so on. The
ﬁnal and eighth charana starts with
taara shadja. Shankar’s performance
ofthis wonderful score was spellbindmg.
Bilaham' (Sri Chamundeshwari),
Hindola and Dwijavanthi (the most
frequently performed Akhilandeshwari) were rendered with energy.

surprised dance lovers by rendering
a krithi, Swaminatha (Nata), imme—

it up with a chaturashra ularippu.
The Saraswathi jathiswara brought

A varied package of nritta, nrithya
and abhinaya made the Nattakuranji vama an impressive presentation.
Shilpa was able to negotiate the technique of Bharatanatya in a commendable manner. Through her interpretations and abhinaya, the dancer
reﬂected the spirit of compositions
like the Saver'i krithi (on Devi, Shankari) and Vasudevacharya’s familiar
krithi Brochevarevar'ura (Khamach).
She captured the contrasting bhaavaas
of the pieces in a stylistic and mature
performance. P u ra n d a r a d a sa ’ s
