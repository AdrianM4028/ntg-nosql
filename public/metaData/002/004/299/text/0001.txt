Aka de mi for his
contribution to Indian
theatre as an actor, Deb
Sankar Halder’s gift for
playing diverse characters
with consummate artistry
has impressed theatre loves
in Delhi whenever Nandikar
under the direction of
eminent theatre director~
actor Rudraprasad
Seng‘upta of Bengali stage
brought its productions
from Kolkata. At present, he
is a much sought after actor
in Bengal, apart from
visiting abroad to give
lectures and demonstrate
acting style. This past week,
discerning audience saw his I
craft as an actor when
Ushneek, Kolkata presented
Kallumama at L'I‘G
auditorium in New Delhi as
part SNA’s Festival of
Performing Arts featuring
the works of the awardees
and follows of 2014Written and directed by
Ishita Mukherjee, the
central character in the play
is Kallumama and the large
cast interacts with him at '
different point of time that
deepens his character as a
social deviant ruthlessly
breaking the rules of the

conventional society. The
events in the play are
projected through ﬂashback
scenes when Kallumama
takes his last breath. It is
thejourney in reverse gear
full of privations, suffering,
bitterness and hatred
against the hostile socioeconomic environment that
forces an innocent
adolescent to be morphosed
into a criminal. It is a kind
of a society marred by
nihilism, anarchy and social
injustice which is a breeding
ground for decadent
lumpen elements and
criminals. The action shifts
to various locales in space
and time to penetrate into I
the past and present of
Kallumama with a pace that
keeps our attention drawn
into the action being
"
enacted on the stage.
We know about the place
where Kallu was born and
brought up. His fatherwas a
landlordin Bangladesh. The
Partition of the country
ruined the life of Kallu as
well as all those forced to
leave their homes in
Bangladesh and to come to
Kolkata as refugees. As an
adolescent Kallu has to look
after his mother. Unable to
bear the shock of the
१

A EROTIC IMAGERY A sceneﬁ'om theplay.
Partition, losing property
and dignity, has become a
psychiatric patient.
Roaming around in a
strange city, Kallu lives in
appalling conditions.
Considered as the dregs
of society, he does all kinds
of menial work to make
both ends meet. He starts
to entertain in crowded
places by performing tricks
which he calls magic show.
All his efforts to earn his
livelihood by honest means
fail.
A shelter-less Kallu gets
shelter in a brothel. He
ﬁnds prostitutes more
compassionate. Resorting
to minor anti-social
activities, he graduates to
become a Mama, a dada.
Now deeply entrenched in
the sordid world of crime, '
he is killed by his own gang
— violent end of a criminal
who established his
supremacy by resorting to
violence.
Writer-director Ishita
has conceived an austere
decor with only a small
platform placed in the
centre upstage. What
makes the production
intricate is the use of
offstage sounds and
recitation of poems which
evoke the right mood as
well as comment on a
heartless society which
breeds characters like
Kallu. The poems suggest

in a subtle manner that a
society based on
exploitation will continue
to create anti—social
elements like Kallu. The
last dialogue of Kallu is
that he is not dead, the
system will produce
another Kallumama — the
cycle will continue until a
just social order is
established.
With a view to provide
backdrop for‘the action
painted sheets held by
stage-hands not visible to
the audience keep moving.
The device also provides
colour to the production.
Similarly, the director has
used colourful saris as a
metaphor for women. In
one of the scenes Kallu, in
a brothel passionately in
love with a sex-worker,
uses a colourful sari in
multiple hues created by
the subtle lighting. The
whole scene is transformed
into an erotic imagery.
Deb Sankar Halder in
the lead role of Kallumama
towers above the huge cast.
Tall and dynamic, he
imparts dramatic energy to
his character which
undergoes to a number of
vicissitudes, constantly
struggling for survival and
security. His Kallu is cruel
and sadistic while he treats
young members of his
gang. He displays certain
dignity while surrounded
by his killers. One of the
highlights of Halder’s
performance is that he
expresses the inner
turmoil, anger and hatred
through his facial
expressions and eyes which
are heightened by the
skilful lighting effects — the
image will haunt the
audience for sometimes.
