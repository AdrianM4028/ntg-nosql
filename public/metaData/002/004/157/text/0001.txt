there are layers and complexities and multiple play-within-a—

Biswas confesses that her
influences have been the love
stories of her friends, as well as

for them before getting married.
If someone from her generation
can feel that way, it means the

comes from the use of

At the same time, she hopes
to challenge the audience — put

“They become part of the narrative, part of the action, and
participate voyeuristically in
this drama. They see the cornplexity and recognise it in their

of established practices here,
a focus on broaching taboo
subjects that people don’t usually broach. Like power structures and the idea of give and

lore of love, but often absent

and subject to power games.
“Love isn’t all teddy bear and
chocolates," she declares.

Indeed, it isn’t.
