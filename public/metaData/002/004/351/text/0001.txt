favourite
experience from
last week and
looks forward to a
new one this week.

PREVIOUS WEEK

THIS WEEK

Last week, I went to see one of my favourite
experiences throughtlie year. The Durga
Puja panda/s. I went to the biggest one on
Ulsoor Road. whilst seeing the deity and _
peOpIe worshipping is always nice, the mix
of Bengali culture - from the niu5ic and _
singing to the veritable culinary feast on display, had my partner and me saying ‘Ballo.
ballo!’ We also enjoyed the cultural functions at the panda].

I'm looking forward to attending the
Mentalist show by Nicolai Friedrich. It always
fascinates me how mentalists read thoughts
and while I've seen afew performances. I'm
keen on experiencing Nicolai's show. Not
only does he use traditionalmagic but he
seems to effortlessly move into thoughtV
reading, which in many ways is the
Grail of Magic!
