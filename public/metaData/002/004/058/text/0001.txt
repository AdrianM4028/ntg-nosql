’I‘ANGMARG, Oct 30:
On 5th day of Bhand
Pather Show series being
organised by Natrang'with
the support of Sangeet
Natak Akademi a pleasant
surprise came from a
remotest part of Kashmir
valley at the village
Hariwatnoo of 'I‘angmarg
where one of the most cel—
ebrated Bhand of the present times- Mohd Sadeeq
presented a mind blowing
theme through his play
‘Brem’
written
Nazir
Ahmed and Directed by
Mohd Sadiq which was
presented by Baba Reshi
F‘olk Theatre:

When we laugh at our own
foibles or life’s frustrations, we take away its
power to make us miser—
able, and instead, give

ing laughters. Through his
magical art of spreading
positivity he is shown
bringing big smiles on his
spectators. Despite having

pliments, chances to be
kind to someone (including themselves), and how
to ﬁnd a positive aspect in
all the little things in life
that the rest of us usually
ignore. Through this play
the playwright appeals the
masses not to befool them-

selves by keeping them—
selves in the web of nega—
tivity. See positivity in
everything and in return,
the positivity will bounce
back to you with lot of
bonus.
