Excelsior Correspondent
JAMMU, Nov 2: Ek Sath
Rang Mandal (ESRM) in collaboration with BLSKS presented
Vijay Malla's new progressive
nukkad ‘Waqt’ in its Monday
Theatre Series at its head quarter
here at Sarwal.
In this progressive nukkad
“Waqt” is the main character
who appeals, guides and
reminds a man that he should act
as per time. He should work
within time and make best utilization of time. Time provides
every individual a best opportunity in his life and one should
take best advantage of it.
The nukkad educates the
audience that time does not wait
for anybody. It is not bound to
wait for you and your mood. It
keeps on changing every now
but people do not change
according to time.

In the nukkad, a farmer says
that he can hardly make his both
ends meet though he works very
hard. Time asks him why he has
not changed his way of working
with the time by using modem
equipments and seeds. Why he
has not changed his farming
ways as per time. He is advised
by Time to change his way of
farming which will save his time
and energy besides giving best
results.
Similarly, a dog bite is treat~
ed by traditional treatment of
old time by parents of a child.
Time again intervenes and
directs them to take him to 1128pital for treatment.
The actors who performed in
the nukkad were Qurat-ul-Ain.
Addison, Rahul Jacker, Master
Nihaal and Vijay Malla.
The nukkad was written and
directed by Vijay Malla and
assisted by Nisha Suri.
