Excelsior Correspondent
JAMMU, Nov 1: Natrang
today presented yet another
Dogri play 'Hathen Diyan
Dittiyan' carrying a very powerful and relevant social message.
The play has been written by
Mohan Singh who is a multifaceted personality of Dogri literature and theatre. The play was
directed by Neeraj Kant.
The play opens at the backdrop of a village, where one person (Basenta) is shown in the
state of extreme melancholy. In
hapless and heartbroken state he
reaches at the bank of a river to
jump and commit suicide but at
the very moment, he is grappled
by his close friend (Rama), who
gets hold of him to save him.
'Basenta' pleads to and
argues with his friend to let him
jump but he doesn't get his grip
loose.
Another
villager,
'Parkash' also enters in the
scene. On asking the reason for
such an extreme step, 'Basenta'
tells that he had tried all the
remedies even exorcism, but he

cannot get a male child. In his
consistent attempts to be a father
of a boy, he had become the
father of six girls yet he has no
clue that how and when his wife
would give birth to a boy.
Though one of a self
acclaimed Gods-man has given
the prophecy that next time he
would deﬁnitely get a baby boy,
yet he is not sure of his fate. On
hearing this, he is lamented and
criticized by his fellow villagers
for his orthodox thinking. They
advise him that rather than getting more girls on earth in order
to get a boy, he should concentrate more on their better
upbringing. This is how the
society will be reformed and
would move towards progress.
Natrang actors who per—
formed in the play include
Shivam Singh, Vishal Shanna,
Kuldeep Angral and Rishabh
Shanna. The sets were designed
by Ankush Lakhnotra, who also
rendered the Lights. Music was
scored by Yash Pal Manhas
whereas Mahikshit Singh did
the presentations.
