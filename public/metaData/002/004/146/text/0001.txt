Teachers often have a knack
for being multitaskers and

atyam. I loved it so much that
it became a passion,” she

says. After mastering the
dance form, she went on to

perform both nationally and
internationally.

Born with a silver spoon,

she has no airs about her: But
what really makes her stand

~. ;\ out is her contribution
जू towards students —
‘ .~ the future of the
" है: country. Involved in
teaching kids with
special needs for around 23
years, she has a lot to be
proud of.
It all began when Radhika was young. “I had
a normal education and
soon went on to study
law. However; with encouragement from
my parents and family, I took a fascin a ti on to

A matter of conscience
However, as time went by, the
dancing waned. “My father
ingrained the thought of giving back to the society in my
mind,” says Radhika. And in
order to contribute something valuable, she went on to
volunteer at schools.
Her first stint with
teaching children

with special needs
. was in Hyderabad.
Thereafter, after

moving to Mumbai, she

joined Able Disable All People Together (ADAPT), where
she dedicated herself voluntarily to teaching kids, who
would otherwise be
sidelined.
“Keeping aside पृ
my love for teaching, I strongly
advocate inclu-

sion and acceptance of all children, despite their

mental capabilities.
One of the prime reasons I
star-ted teaching kids with
special needs is because I
honestly think I can encourage them to learn and in a
way that is comfortable for

them,” she explains.
One of the hardest things
Radhika encountered while
teaching was the need to educate parents and the children
about the disabilities.
“It’s heart-breaking

since I always strive
to bring out the best
in every student,”
she says.

Radhika also Completed a couple of
courses in counselling

in order to help parents
and students accept the harsh
realities in the best way possible. While most of us are
oblivious to the fact that some
students simply cannot study
mainstream subjects, Radhika stresses that it is imperative to understand the
strengths of each student and
channel them in that direction, instead of forcing them
to study subjects they dislike,

and often blindly.

The bottom line
After spending more than two
decades in a satisfying career,

Radhika is finally leaving
ADAPT, but with the best
memories anyone could hope
to have. To this, she happily
says: “I can freely say that I

have done my part in teaching
kids and giving them a brighter future. In fact, I am in touch

with all my students and I’m
always available for them. ”
After chatting with her, it
can be concluded that excluding students based on any criteria should be stopped. “Children must be taught to be
accepting, regardless of any

disability. Such thoughts
should be ingrained in them
from a young age. Children
often overlook weaknesses
and it should be kept that
way,” she concludes.
