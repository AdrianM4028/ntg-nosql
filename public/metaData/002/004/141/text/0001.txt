Candy Cigarettes by city-based group Grim
Pumpkin Theatre, was about -a young couple
— Aditi and Varun — leading a seemingly
ordinary life, but it’s not so as they suffer
from schizophrenia and imagine that their
stillborn baby has grown into a 10-year-old
son Ronnie. And the actors delivered a good
performance. But they do accept that handling a sensitive topic like this was difficult.
Ushasi Banerjee, who played Aditi, says, “It
was crazy to delve deeper into all of Aditi’s
layers. I’m not sure if I’ve managed to fathom
her character still. But I am thrilled to have

played Aditi for my ﬁrst major role.”
Nayana Raj, who played Aditi’s sister Jiya,
made a stellar debut on stage with this play. “I
was terriﬁed before my performance. I’m
glad that people liked it,” Nayana says.
The group practised for about a month
before bringing the show on stage. “The
moment we understood the concept, it was a
no-brainer to do the script. Swayam really
worked hard on it. It was a bit tight with the
cast as we were also busy with a few other
projects, but it worked out well,” Sishir says.
