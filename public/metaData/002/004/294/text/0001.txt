without a word on Sappliire's
initiative. which is meant to open

up new non-proscenium art spaces
and encourage more people to
come and indulge in art — from
cafes, bookshops and galleries to
cultural centres and corporate
boardrooms, The group believes
that it has a responsibility towards
the fostering of contemporary arts
in the East in particular and the
country in general. It also
understands that unless artistes
support each other", an awakening
in our social and political systems
towards encouraging art is
impossible. The Series has been
running for 19 quarters from 2010
and has presented works by
Sapphire and non-Sapphire
