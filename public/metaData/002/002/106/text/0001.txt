PTI-Television , the text/

orip'nallywritten in English
by Menon (who was those
days the Arts Editor for
Delhi's TbeEt‘onomi: Tin-its).
Arts Curator Menon mentioned that when PTI-TV
had wound up in 1994 and
all theirtapesand recordings
had vanished without trace.
the present version that was
being screened was originally a direct-ﬂour-TV VHS
recording. Around 1999, the
fungus-affected tape was
cleaned and copied on to a
DVD by Krissy Biemacki,
an Americandance student
who hadspent ah'nost ayear
in Chennai and had helped
Chandra convert some of
the other tapes to DVD. As
the sole surviving copy of
the original. it happened to
bean important piece in archival history for researchers, curators,enthusiasts on
Chandralekha and Indi n
dance traditions. /
