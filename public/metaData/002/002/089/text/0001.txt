Music wasn t the only sphere that was

trahsformed by the Swinging Sixties
CH RIS M U GAN

There has been so much visual documentation of Sixties pop culture —— iconic
photo shoots, album covers

and ﬁlms of dandies parading down Carnaby Street —it is easy to forget the impact
ofthis vibrant period on ﬁlm
andtelevision.
This lacuna is addressed
by a forthcoming book that
documents the inﬂuence
of British music on visual
entertainment at the height
ofthe swinging Sixties. Psychedelic Celluloid.- British Pop
in Film and ’I'V1965-1974 covers this time in minute detail,

noting the inﬂuence ofpop

It is the ﬁrst book by Si-

the inﬂuential Pink Floyd to
weird cameos from the likes
of(a pre-Crazy WOrld of)Arthur Brown.
Because this stampede for
pop resources led to a sense
of bandwagon-jumping,
ﬁlm and TVfrom the mid- to
late-Sixties is not as revered
nowadays as the earlier
kitchen-sink period, dominated by northern scribes
and working-class actors
making their names with “A
Taste OfHoney” and “This
Sporting Life”. That Matthews’ opening year makes
a useful cut—offbetween the
two eras is illustrated by

some of the freewheeling,

this style further a year later
