It is a rainygevening. A woman
calls her brother to her farmhouse in the outskirts. She
wants him to help her pack up\
the house. The tenanthas just
left and some new tenants are .
coming to check the place out.
There is very apparent tension
between this brother sister duo
not just from a class perspective

(he is a carpenter and ‘she is the
'

Head of the Department of

Literature at a p’reStigious college) but also in their lifestyles,
philosophies and values. The
evening progresses with both of
them taking jibes at each other
and making below‘ the belt
remarks to each other: Little by
little they (and we) start discovering secrets and hidden

aspects of their personalities.
This is a play thats refreshingly
non sugar coated it is sharp, fast
paced and before you know it
theres a couple of sucker
punches there that could knock

'

you out.
