DC CORRESPONDENT
,1 Earlier this week, the art community woke up to a
huge loss withthe passing of eminent Bengalurubased artist Yusuf Arakkal. Just like his art, his
personality and his willingness to helppeople left a last—
ing impression on everyone's mind.
Though primarily settled in Bengaluru, Arakkal had
made many friends and admirers in Hyderabad, a place
which he used to visit oﬁen to be part of several art
camps. Friends and fellow artists pay tribute to the compassionate human being and the amazing artist he was.

my happiness knew no bounds. He
was ﬂamboyant both in life and in art,
and was one of the best mentors anyone
could get — he knew just the right thing to
say. Even though we weren‘t in the same city, we were in
touch. The World has lost not just a great artist, but an
amazing person too.

I 1he first time I met Yusuf was in the
late 805 when he was in Hyderabad
for an art camp. His technique of
painting was amazing. He’d paint
using oil paints and then he'd clear
away some of the paints with a cloth,
resulting in some stunning work.
Catching a glimpse of him painting
was difﬁcult as he was a very private

untouched by his goodness. His passing leaves a gaping
hole in the world of art.

rakkal would take keen interest in
the works of his fellow artists and
would never turn down anyone who
asked him for help. I did get to work
with him in an art camp and that’s
where he spotted me. A few years

II1he best thing about Arakkal, apart
from his art that is, was hisfriendly nature.
time I met him
was at the Sanghi art camp in 199 . .
where we stayed together for six
days. His energy was something you
couldn‘t keep up with. As an artist, his
style was amazing and he was very fast
with his work, but the quality never sulfered. He had a great sense of composition and colour
scheme. Arakkal‘s sense of humour left an impression
on everyone he met.
