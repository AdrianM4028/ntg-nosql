Art ethiti’on
Sir,

Refer to the Art Exhibition featuring 30 Duggar artists open at JU.
The Art Exhibition organised at the Rinchen Zangpo Art Gallery दृ
University of Jammu will surely serve the cause of Dogri a language rich in
melody and spoken by a large number ofpeople in Jammu and Kashmir, and
Himachal Pradesh.

Due to advent of TV and other modes of communication. Dogri received
. a temporary setback. It became a craze for people to speak in Hindi and

English. These languages becames symbols of upward mobility in the soci- .
ety. The speakers of thee languages however failed to realise the import of
neglecting mother tongue. One who is not connected to mother tongue usually distances himself from cultural moorings in which one has grewn up.
There is urgent need to revive traditional customs and rituals to lend a vibrancy to ethos of Duggar land. After its inclusion in 8th schedule of Indian
Constitution, Dogri received much impetus and respectability.
Those who worked for its inclusion in the schedule, did their job, and
now it is upto Dogri people to lend it more respectability by using it day to
day affairs. That does not mean we will discard other languages like Hindi

or English which are our national languages and means of communication at

, global level. Therefore, it is urgent to the organisers to hold more and more .

exhibitions on a regular basis to keep the tempo going on.
Yours etc...
