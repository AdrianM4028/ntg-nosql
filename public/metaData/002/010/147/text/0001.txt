Girish Kamad's contemporary and penetrating

look at a burgeoning metropolis, Boiled Beans on
Toast offers wonderful vignettes of a society in
flux. A serene, old lady unexpectedly discovers a
passion for horse-racing; a small-town youth,
devoted to his family, gets mesmerised by the
prospects of sudden prosperity; a trustworthy

servant is discovered floating homeless in the
३ nightmarish streets; and a dim maid learns how to
fight for survival within the confines of a kitchen.
Whatwe have is modern city life inits many
shades.
