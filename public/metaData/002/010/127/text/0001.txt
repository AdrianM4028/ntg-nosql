Dancer Rukmini

\frjayakumar brings
Aung San Suu Kyi’s
story on stage

AUNG San Suu Kyi inspired a generation
when she became the face of the Burmese
independencestruggle. Herjourney from
being the face of the two decade-long fight
against an autocratic regime to being the
first state counselor of democratic
Myanmar today, earned her admirers from
acrossthe globe. Naturally, in spite of
essaying the character for the first time
seven years ago, actress Rukmini
Vijayakumar still feels nervous to portray
her on stage in the play, The Lady of
Burma. Based on British playwright
Richard Shannon's play by the same name,
Suu Kyi’s story—which will be presented at
the end of the month at the Museum
Theatre— has been directed by renowned
Bengaluru-based theatre personality and
actor, Prakash Bel awadi. “Itwas initially
emotionally draining morethan anything
else, but now she’s a part of me,” says
दृ \ﬁjayakumar, describing her experience.
The solo show will seethe dancer
explorethe legendary democrat in the
roles of a mother, daughterand wife— a
testimony to her strength and grit. Simple
lighting, no sets and the idea of space created with movement by the actor characterise the play, which has music by
renowned classical singer MD Pallavi
Arun. “We take our freedoms for granted.
We don’t question the use and abuse of
power by those in authority often enough.
Rather, we are servile and fawning. That’s
whythis story of hope and heroism is so
’
a; important to retell,” says Belawad i, who
made headlines recently for his performance in the movie Airlift. The play has
been staged in Bengaluru and Murnbai,
and is returning to Chennai for the second
time, after nearly a year.
At the Museum Theatre, on September 30,
at 7.30 pm. Tickets from 3500 onwards.
