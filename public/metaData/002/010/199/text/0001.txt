Theatre is a drawrng art
form for anybody who has
had a taste. but is also one
which is extremely difficult
to sustain. When asked about
it. she says, "At least in

There are web series you can

things. But yes. if you are not

Recently they went to trib»

with short plays for students to tell them about
the importance of education," she says.
With inspirations like
these and experiences from
all over the globe. there is
little doubt that Yuki will be

in that journey and you
would not want to miss it.

we can't get them a job immediately,
I pay them a little money so they
don't go back to committing crimes
to earn money," he says.
Raiashekar informed us about
a lot of youngsters are being tric
to enter the political line. They are
promised posts of a Corporater and
are told they could earn a lot of
money: Only aﬁer ﬂiey have been
utilised to their fullest, they realise
that they have been tricked.
So far, Raiashekar has reformed 20
individuals in five months “i talk to
their families and keep a check to
ﬁnd out it they have gone back to the
criminal field. I think 20 is a good
number. And so tar; none of them
have gone back to committing
crimes and are happy," he smiles.
