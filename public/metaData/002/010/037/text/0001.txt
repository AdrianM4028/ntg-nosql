The function was-followed by the first night’s play.
Saanko from Gauhati University presented Mahajag—
ya, written by Dr Sitanath Lahkar and directed by

‘ Debashis Saikia. Written in the backdrop of the then
prevailing situation in the country before demolition
of the Babri Masjid, the play depicts the fragile
communal fabric of society. It beautifully showcases
how the ruling class, irrespective of religious orienta-

tions, exploits people’s sentiments for their benefit
by disturbing peace and unity in society.

Of Charbak, written and directed by Dr Sitanath
Lahkar. The play is based on the character Charbak,
who is denied existence of soul and its so-called union
with the ‘supreme being’ after death. The drama
presents arguments of both sides, believing and not

believing in the existence of the soul. It alsoraises
है the burning. issue of caste and untouchability that still
prevails in society.

Tomorrow, New Delhi-based JNU’s‘Jumbish Arts

will perform Gaurakh Dhanda, written and directed
by Satish Mukhtalif and based on HarishankarParsai’s
’ satires. Based on the ongoing attacks on democratic
values and secularism eitherin the name of protec—
tion of ‘Indian culture’ or ‘nationalism’ or ‘cow
protection’ in the country, the play attempts to build a
dialogue and create space for social harmony.
