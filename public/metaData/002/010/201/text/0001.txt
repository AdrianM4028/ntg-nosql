Exceptional
show
Last evening. we watched
the ﬁrst of the plays of the
Hindu Theatre Festival in
Bangalore for 2016 The
turnout was low, but then it
was Tuesday evening. The
irniriediate feeling that one
getsafter watching the play is
how well the actors played
out their roles; and ’s was
especially inspiring for the
youngsters in the audience.
The energy of the actors was
infectious and the comic roles
were hilarious. There were

Finding the you in you, you never knew
The high-energy, Yataqarasu, the
opening play of The Hindu Theatre
Fest 2016, followed youngsters as
they discover their potential. Here is
a selection of the Citizen reviews

some exceptional scenes, the
scenes which broughtout the
character of each child and
the ones between the parents
and children.
One important takeaway
for youngsters would be that,
each one of us are different
and that, that's not a bad
thing! The play also brings
out the problems achild faces
in school is not unique to
them and that it is okay to be
yourself.
Weaving
the
mythological story into the
play and the signiﬁcance of
‘Yatagarasu‘ was not very
clear and that could have
been brought outbetter.

Yatagarasu. but it had a bad

desperately wanted to leave
for a breath of fresh air,
Yatagarasu knocked my head
and forced me to stay on in
order to be mesmerized by
the climax.
‘Hit. Hit Hurray‘ for all the
actors and their zestful
performances, ‘Hate, Hate
Hurray' for too many dance
