WOVENSCAPES
kch of master weaver and artist Dinesh
Kureltar’s works takes three months to
complete, with the meticulous tapestry that
is woven into his art! Tapestry is generally
misunderstood as a piece of art décor, a wall
han ' ig or just another decorative item. But.
somehave dared to look at it in a different
way and establishedit as an independent
form ofart. Using his imagination. delicate
touch and zest for creating interlinked
spaces, Kurekar hasadded a dashof the
abstract to his creations, carving out 'a niche
for hii'nseli' in the world of contetriporaryartists. His painstakingly hand-woven ideas
in natural dyed wool and cottonthread give
his landscape 3 very realist feel. They are
abstractions of nature. a corriplexity of
organic natural formsreduced to basic
shapes such as rectmigles, circles and
horizontal ﬂoating fomts of waves or birds.
