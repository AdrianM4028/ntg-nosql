ou’d expect the conductor of an antakshari
to be singing antaras and mulchras. So why
was Rajat Baid spouting ﬁlmi dialogues at
Vidya Mandir on September 3? The answer lies in
the name of the event — Funtakshari!
Organised by the Birla High School Alumni,
and powered by t2, the third edition of
Funtgkshari was held at Vidya Mandir. And the
dialogues were for a super-fun buzzer round
where participants had to identify the movie from
the dialogue and sing a song from that movie.
The evening saw 17 alumni associations taking
partin this battle of music and lyrics. St. Xavier’s
Collegiate School, The Park English School, Birla
High School, Sushila Birla Girls’ School and
Albany Hall Public School made itto the ﬁnals
after two eliminary rounds.

“It was a lovely evening. I was
here to cheer for my husband
Rizwan Ahmed (an Albanite
of the 1980 batch). His team
didn’t win but they did reach
the ﬁnals. I particularly

enjoyed when Soch na sake from
Airlift was sung, it’s one of my favourite
songs,” saidFarhana Ahmed, a dentist.

' “The event was very
enjoyable. I’m from Modern

High School for Girls. My
KOLKA‘TA PARKERS

really like how he made the

Alumni, represented by Rachana Mohata (left),
batch of 1998, and Nisha Chamaria, batch of

2002, sang their wayto victory. “It felt very
special to represent our school and win the
competition too. This is the ﬁrst time that our
school participated in Funtakshari, which
makes this win even more special. The musical
round, where we managedto guess the song at
the last moment, was perhaps the most tense
as well as interesting part of this day,” said
Nisha. The duo took home the trophy, a cash
prize of Rs 15,000 and a gift hamper.

; Kolkata Parkers, the
alumni association of The Park English
School, came second. “The best part for
me was seeing all our friends jump up
and dance when we were declared the
runner-up, My partner and I were in
the same class right from nursery to
Class X and our bond helped us get the
answers really quickly,” said Raj Bagri
(right) of the 1990 batch, who teamed up
with batchmate Nalin Bhansali.

Emcee Rajat Baid, an exstudent of BirlaHigh School
ﬁ'om the 1990 batch, put the "
‘fun’ in Funtakshari. “It
feels great to conduct this
event, which is not just an
antakshari. So we try not to
make the rules too rigid... we want to give
everyone the opportunity to sing their
hearts out. We try to make sure that
everyone goeshome happy,” he said;
