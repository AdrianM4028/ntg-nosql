Let’s go back in history, in 1930,
when the nineteemyear-old
Chandrasekhar, also known as
Chandra, set sail from Madras to
Cambridge for his graduate studies.
During the voyage, which had him

spending nights under the stars, he
formulated a mathematical description about what later (in 1967)
came to be known as a black hole.
Simply put, it is a region of space
from which nothing, including
light, can escape, and is usually

formed when a star is dying. Unlike

The story has been set in an

racism. ambition, friendship, and
betrayal through the two World

Wars, the Indian freedom struggle,
