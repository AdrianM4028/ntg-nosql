Three Men, th
Park, located just about any-

where. An inevitable squabble
for the choicest of seats. Each
man's claim seems to be the
most fundamental and, as always, there's never enough
room for everyone. On the face
of it, Park is a comedy play
about three men in a park fight-

ingfor their individual space.
;. HoWever, the playful banter
soon turns into a serious fight as
questions of space, territory and
ownership become fraught with
tension. Park takes a light-heart-

red"look at issues of identity and
belonging that plague oUr day
to day life.
