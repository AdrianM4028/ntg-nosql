It opens with a meeting session
organised by a local administrative
body to discuss their grievances and
propose their suggestion to the superior

authorities. But, the group discusses
everything under the sky ranging from '
hobbies, sharing cheap jokes, relationship, except the agenda of the meeting! The play is engrossed with subtle
humour which shows how the formula
of majority has been mocked in our
democracy.
