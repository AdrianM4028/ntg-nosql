CAFE FIRQOSE

‘

.A Devised Theatre
३ erformance. A
group of actors try '
to devise a perform-

.

. . . . . . .. .

ance based on an
imaginary terrorist

attack, Somewhere in the world. They try
to base it on traces of recent such incidents, but repeatedly, their attempts to
find a narrative, a structure, to find ,mean- x
ing break down. How does one find meaning amid what is meaningless? They look
towards poetry, towards their own memo-r

ries, and try to ask,‘ what is it that we live
and die for? What do we seek? Layers of ‘
the personal and the imaginary merge
into this broken structure that keeps
falling apart, at whose heart lies the fragile '

beauty of the human body.
