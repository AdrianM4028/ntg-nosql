hweta Shetty has just
returned from a re
hearsal of Retli Songs of the Sand. an
adaptation of William
Shakespeare‘s The Merchant of
Venice a huge musical production
being directed by Dr Satyabrata
Rout. The singer is exhausted but
a cup of coffee has revivedher and
she is ’ looking forward to our little
chat. Her excitement also stems
from the factthat she is playing the
role of Shylock. the antagonist and
one of the most memorable characters created by the playwright. The
character of Shylock has been
played by men in adaptationsall
over; and it's theﬁrst time, it is is
being played by a woman. “I
thought to myself. this is a huge re
sponsibility but then I‘m always
upfor a challenge." she smiles,

The singer, who became an indipop sensation with her songs

to her college buddy and theatre
producer Ashvin Gidwani, who offered her the role of Shylock in the
grand production.
1 have to admit. I am more of a
singer than an actor." says Shweta.
who has acted in a couple of plays
during her college days. 24 years
ago. “As a singer, you have to
emote for your videos. but acting
on stage. that too in a Dr Rout play
is a different hallgame altogether
because he is a pure theatre per

of days. she watched the rest of
the team rehearse the Rajasthani—
Hindi play and itwas a learning
experiencefor her. ‘-‘Wre have been

Shylock is a tough character. 1t has
been an arduousjourney but at
the end of the day. I think I have
managed to do a pretty good job.
I‘m' a keen learner and I hope that
it comes across." she adds.
Musically yours
Shweta had one criteria when she
agreed to take on this role of a
lifetime. “I told Ashvin, that if I
have to sing on stage, then let me
sing Opera. He asked me if 1 want

would like to do it in Hindi. And
let the tell you. to sing Opera in

says, “I have not seen Opera being sung in Hindi anywhere in
the world. There are too many

words used to convey one emo-

makes it really tough to sing Opera in Hindi. " But Shwcta wanted
