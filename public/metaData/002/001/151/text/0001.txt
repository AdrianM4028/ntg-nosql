Thiruvananthapuram:
. The Kerala government
5 has cancelled govern-

ment land granted to set
up the Ustad Amjad Ali
Khan International
School of Music in
'I‘hiruvananthapuram on
the grounds that Khan’s .
name was misused

by vested interests
to get prime real
estate. The
previous Congressled government had

allotted two acres from a
1’7—acre parcel of land
owned by the tourism
department to set up the
school. The
८ CPI(M)—1ed
Ustad

AmhdAH
Khan

LDF government has left
the matter to the Cabinet
sub-committee, which is
looking into the decisions
of the previous government taken during the
slog overs of its term.
Incidentally, Sheik
Pareeth, a governing
member of the school
board, was the
tourism
director at
the time of
land allotment.
