Gurunath has been helping these

Vidyanjali 'l‘herapy Centre,
Chennai. in Tamil Nadu for the past
six months.
Manjith. 14 (name changed). who

a straw which spreads in a circle
creating tiny cherry blossoms on a
white and pink~laced canvas. He lets
Out a snort of laughterand joy at

But this is not the story of
Manjith or other disabled children
learning art. This is the story of a
retired engineer transforming into

out of boredom, Gurunath took to
an online portal to learnpainting a
year ago. He found theexercise
therapeutic andliberating.
“I was able to make my ﬁrst
painting in two months because my
tutor. Australian artist Len Hand,
had really useful tips." says
Gurunath, who claims to have no
previous talent in art.
Wanting to share the
knowledge with other senior
citizens, Hend created this online
portal with tips and suggestions on
learning painting and invited them
to painttogether. “Though the
website had useful tips, it was not a
success. Many senior citizens
expressed interest but the interest
waned aﬂer a couple of months,"
Gurunath says.
One day; I got the idea to become
an art tutor from a friend abroad,
who was working with the school as
a therapist-consultant. “As soon as I
visited the school, I was eager to get
,

into teaching art at Vidyanjali
Therapy Centre. But It was not that
easy. Having no idea about the
developmental issues of children.
my first class was a disaster when I
realised many kids had difficulty
holding the paint brush,“ he says.
But with time, Dr Vidya, who
runs the therapy centre, and the
tutor have found alternative ways to
help them know more about the
world of art. “We make them use
sponge and straws to spread colours
on the canvas. Tracing sheets and
spray paints are also used to make
small shapes." Gurunath says.
At the centre. he settles down
with students to help them. Those
who can hold the paintbrush dip
them in green and yellow acrylic
paints bringing out the beauty of
sunvkissed bushes on their canvas.
And their happiness is boundless.

Gurunath took to a

“Now theirfaces brighten up as I
enter the room and it givesme a
sense of satisfaction. And I would
love to help as many children as
‘
possible in learning the art," he says.
They make sure the paint is
chemical-free, so that the children
who are prone to respiratory
allergiesare not affected.
Dr Vidya, who has been able to
integrate many children into
mainstream schools. says, “The art
workshop has a healing effect on
children who suffer from anxiety
and depression. Besides, it helps
new children to relax, open up and
enjoy their time. Looking at what
they have been able to do with
colours, gives them a sense of
accomplishment and they develop a
sense of belonging to the environment here,"
