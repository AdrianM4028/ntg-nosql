Why did they zero in on
‘Dowri Kalyana ...‘ for the
occasion? “We wanted to
bring in as many actors as
possible." says Kathadi.
"and after ‘Thuppariyuin

30 characters. it is ‘Dowri
...' with 18."
Stage Creations does
not rest on its laurels. “We
are assiduously infusing
young blood into the
troupe," says Kathadi.
“Nowadays I don't get
into the nitty-gritty of
production. Srinivas and
Naanu take care of them. I
want Stage Creations to
go on forever. With
