What is your view
regarding the ‘light

Usually thumri is not

Tappa is an idiom to

Gwalior and Banaras. The
khatka application in tappataans of Gwalior an
Bariaras has little difference.
To master these khatka

What about dndra,

No shortcuts! (laughs)
Agreed, they are much
lighter than thumris; yet
they demand a fair deal of
competent handling of
lyrics, sur and tala to leave
a lasting impact. Earlier

and more purposeful. That

(samanvaya), upliﬁment of
all (sarvodaya) and
comprehensive View
(poorna drushti) are the
important tenets of
Kuvcmpu's poeticvision
(kavi darshana). It is
through that‘vision‘, we
need toconstruct our
understanding of Kuvempu.
Itis tobe remembered
that some Navodayn writers
(including Kuvempu) were
criticized by many Navya
writers for theireloquence
ofwordswhich contradicted
theirrealistic concerns of
life: Though
Ananthnmurthy during his
last years had mellowed in
his criticism ofKuvernpu,
his earlier observations on
his writings are still valid.
Further, it would also be
interesting to study why
Kuvempu. the author of
Jalagara and Shudra
'l‘apaswi, had to be inspired
by Vivekanandaand notby
Ambedkar. Could it be the
case that the locus ofhis
inspiration is ‘virtuous'

intend to reformulnte
