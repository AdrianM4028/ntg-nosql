Theatre's team led by Director
Ravinder Sharma left today to
participate in 6th National
Theatre Festival at Rabhindra
Bhawan, Guwahati, Assam. The
team will perform Rabindernath
Tagore's world famous play
"Dak Ghar" in Dogri, adaptation

done by Dr Sudhir Mahajan.
The play is about a small boy
who is chronically ill. On
account of his sickness, the boy
is conﬁned to his bed, and he sits

by his Window; watching life go
by without him. Only" by dying
is the boy ﬁnally set free. In this
manner, the play is primarily a
metaphor for spiritual freedom,
for death as a beginning rather
than an ending. The play also
presents a social commentary on
class structure through the ser-

Unlike other plays of RN
Tagore, the Dak Ghar contains
two parallel ﬂights--the naturalistic and syrnbolical. The human
and spiritual the ﬁrst may be
interpreted as desire of the mind
for material things and the second may be the desire of soul
and fulﬁllment of these desire
are symbolized by the Amal's
death. This is the ﬁrst of its kind
play in the Indian Drama history
having children and adult with
the blend of mind and spirit. The
beauty of this play is its relevance and signiﬁcance both for
children and the.adult as well.
