Summing up, Ranjana said,
“The festival’s core thematic
of form, identity and dissent
offer a petent grid that asks a
wide range of questions about
dance practice, keeping it
alive,
current
and
contemporary, in abstraction
yet in tune with its socio-political landscape. How can we
frame dance practice in ways
that allow it to correspond to

present-day realities? What is
the ‘political’ dancing body?
How do artists make choices
to belong, represent, appropriate, assert or deny? This is
What we’re hoping to explore
through the festival.”
