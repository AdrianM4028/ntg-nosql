refuses her marriage. Their lives
move on, till they are reunited 15
years later, when Antu is unable to
pay the loan he took from the
Rani forhis friend Vishnu's
marriage. He must pay ahefty
time, unless the intelligent Purshi
(Portia), Vishnu (Bassanio)’s

fiance. can think ofa quick fix.
The female leads in the play do
not need to dress up as men to
assert their thoughts and ideas in
Reth. “This is in keeping up with
Shakespeare‘s line of strong
female characters like lady
Macbeth," explains Shetty, for
whom the iourney back to lndia,
after her life in Germany. has been
nothing less than the emotional.
For Rout himself, the
expression ofShylock as a woman
is critical —an idea that came
to him two years back when he
started work on the script. Known
for his terriﬁc scenography, he
promises to recreate sand storms

Slrylock is doing her
stretches. On a speaker
somewhere, the production's
distinctive album — an opera,

kaiasthani-iolk fusion that

exploded with over 20 lakh likes
in the first three hours of its
YouTube release — creates a
surreal atJnosphere. This is the
rehearsal of Rah: Songsuflhe Sand,
veteran director Dr Satyabrata
Rout’s Hindi adaptation of
William Shakespeare’s The
Merchantof Vmire.
In the absence of the director,
the actors are relaxed and
exchanging jokes in the Bikanerl

liindi that they have mastered for
the play. Shweta Shetty, a popular
lndi-pop singer of 905 hits suchas
Iuhrmyloker, presides over the
rehearsal. She nits a striking figure
as Rani Bhamari —Sltylock
reirnagined as a matriarch in
Raiasthan ‘— who in Rout's Reth
does get a happy ending. "Maa,
saas. nani!” she seethes, seated on

her throne and one can see her, in
her mirrored and printed

Raiasthani regalia, weighing the
futures of Maru Nagar's poor men.
“I have no idea why they
approached me,” she laughs, adding thatunlike her character she is
an emotional fool. “But now I
don't seeanyone as her but me."
One hour forty»ﬂve minutes
long, Roth tells the story of a
vengeful Rani Bharnari, who is
enraptured by the successful mer—

Thumbing through the thick
script, the actors laugh when
asked about the dialect, crushing
any worry that the metropolitan
Indian may not understand their
world of awenga and ohe chhorrl.
With rigorous rehearsals for six
months and an absolute faith in
scriptwriter Kuldeep Kunal's language, they seem confident.
instead they prepare —for an
exquisite bit oftheaue that is a
must-watch for the city‘s
