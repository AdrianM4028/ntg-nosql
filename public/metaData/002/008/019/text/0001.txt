mer is a riveting comic drama set during El Salvador’s
civil unrest in .the Seventies.
Originally conceived as a twoman drama, it puts a face and
voice to a brutal period ofhistory that leads to tens ofthou—
sands of deaths and which, in
a sense, was never truly resolved.
That face, is Hesus, a poor
but proud farmer, living with
his wife and children in a vil—
lage in this Central American

country. His one proud possession is a plot of land on a
hillside riddled with rocks. As i
the civil rest unfolds, he slowly loses everything he holds
dear — to malnutrition, rape,
torture, murder and more.
Based on historical fact, this
play transcends time and
