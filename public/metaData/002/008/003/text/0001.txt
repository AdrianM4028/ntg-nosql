In the past, director Sunil

dancer 'I‘anushree Shankar,

whose performance in the city
will present 'I‘agore’s only
English poem, The Child

Sishutirtha in 1931). Titled

Indian Dance Creations and

’I‘anushree believes that the
writing was way ahead of its
time, and holds true even
today. She says, “'I‘agore’s The
Child focuses largely on the
search for leadership. We
chose this poem because
I found it interesting
theatrically. "
However, the biggest
challenge, she explains, was to
bring out the essence of each
of the 10 verses through body
language and movement. “The
essence has to be retained and
represented accurately. Some
gestures and movements help
the audience understand the
meaning of the piece, but
unlike reciting, there is no
pause or break here,” says
Tanushree .
The presentation will also

together by classical composer
Debajyoti Mishra.
“The poem talks about
man’s journey from the
darkness of ignorance,
hopelessness and desperation
of life, to the light of
knowledge and understanding.
Thedance piece depicts this
interpretation using the

five-minute dance pieces,
besides The Child, which is a
40-minute act. The four dance
pieces include Radha based on
the music of Anand Shankar
(Tanushree’s late husband);
Manmayuri, based on the

technique of blending

relationship of the peacock

contemporary and innovative
styles of dance like Rabindra
Nritya. But it also has a
distinct Indian element to it,”
says 'I‘anushree, who is the
daughter-in-law of legendary

with the rain; Rishivihar will
showcase the killing of
animals, and Reincarnation
has been created on music
composed by Amaan Ali Khan
and Ayaan Ali Khan.
