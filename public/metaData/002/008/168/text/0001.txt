With the controversy over
return of awards yet to

subside, few recipients of
the Sahitya Akademi’s
Yuva Puraskar in 2016 on
Wednesday stated accepting the awards does not
mean they do not condemn the “religious intol-

erance” against which
several past winners have
staged an award wapsi.

“Receiving this award
does not mean that I do
. not condemn the religious
intolerance
spreading
across the country,” said
Kannada author Mounesh
Badiger at an awardees’
meet organised by the
Sahitya Akademi here.

“At a time when we are
seeing increasing religious conﬂicts in the
country, communal vio-

lence, when a lot of writers, agitated by the brutal
murder of intellectuals,
are involved in a campaign to return their
awards and at a time when
the performance of the
Sahitya Akademi itself is
viewed as questionable, I
was in a big dilemma as to

whether or not to accept
this award,” Mr Badiger
said.

He said he ultimately
decided - to “accept the
award with humble feeling”.
“Artistes like me who
rely on art for our livelihood most certainly do not
have the forward ﬁnancial
strength to refuse an
award of this huge an
amount,” he said. '
