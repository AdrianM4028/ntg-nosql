" Passion . "
Passion also summed up Charlcs’s
performance at the recent Dharani Dance Festival at Kochi, as he
moved across the stage in a ﬂuid and
elegant style, especially duringthe
30-minute varnmn (mum ofsong).
One of Kochi’s seniordance teachers and a former Kalashcu-astudent,
Girija Ravindranath says: "Charles
is an extremely energetic and dedicated dancer. He was able to emote
with his whole body ratherthan with
just his face. He moved inc and the
audience aswell,"
Since the age of 16 Charles has
been drawn to the artform. “I don't
know why I like Bharatanatyam,"
he says. “This passion burns inside
me. I got up and sleep with it."
Initially, he faced a lot of scepticisrn. “Somebody said, ‘You have
small eyes, how can you do Bharatanatyam?"‘ says Charles. But one
