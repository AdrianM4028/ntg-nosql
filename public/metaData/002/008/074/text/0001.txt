JAMMU, Nov 15: Dogri play
‘Suno Eh Kahani’, written and
directed by Balwant Thakur, was

staged here today at Natrang
Studio Theatre, Kachi Chawni in

Sunday Theatre Series.
The play is a wholesOme blend
of almost all the Dogri Folk Art
forms and thus acts aptly as theatre
as an eﬁ‘ective tool of mass awareness. Such is the beauty of this
play that this performance, which
acts like a catalyst before the mass

ablel groom is found and marriage
date is ﬁxed. While the marriage
ceremonies are being performed,
help comes in the form of intervention by legal authorities and
decision of marriage is deferred
for appropriate time. The play
highlights the plight ofyoung girls
who are sacriﬁced at the altar of
rotten, redundant customs of illit-

society.

Today’s play was based on the
story of a young girl ‘Guddi’ representing a major section of rural
lower middle class adolescent
young girls, who are forced into
matrimony at a very tender age.
Guddi is fully aware of the strains
of early marriage, as it has taken
its toll in untimely death of her
mother: She wants to grow and get
educated before she takes up the
responsibility of married life. Her
dreams are shattered, as a ‘suit-

the play,
Mohit Sharma and

with professional ease. Pawan
Verma as clownish groom generated repeated laughter through his
comic acts. Rahul Singh as
‘Police Man’ was also very
impressive. Others who performed

the play, included Ankush
Lakhnotra,
Rajan
Thakyal,
Shivam Singh, Pankaj Verma and
Vishal Shanna. Aishwarya Sathe
