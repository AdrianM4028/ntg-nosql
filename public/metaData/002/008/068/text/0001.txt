ndian law had banned child marriages long time back and later

enforced it with the Prohibition
of Child Marriage Act making it
illegal for girls to marry below 18
' and for boys below 21 years. Child

marriage is an offence but still is
very much there in the country To
raise this issue, the second day of

the theatre festival for child rights
showcased the play ‘Kayi Tharo
Kariyo Main Kasoor’. The play

written and directed by Saurabh
Bhatt aimed atdemolishing the old
tradition of child marriage and the

plot showcased that even today
many children are forced to get
married at a verytender age.
The plot revolved around a village woman Lajwanti who herself ‘

is a victim of child marriage but I
stands against all odds and saves ~

her children ﬁ‘omthis trap. Lajwanti sacriﬁces her ownlife to save others from this evil custom and still
stays in everybody’s hearts forever.
The play also signiﬁed that such a ‘
custom won’t come to an end on its

own but it is for the people, as citizens of the country who need to
make efforts to stop child marriages in India. The characters of Lajwanti and sarpanch played by

Rimjhim and Samwaad respectively impressed everyone. The play
‘Sitaare Zameen Par’ would be
staged on Monday, the concluding
day of the festival.
