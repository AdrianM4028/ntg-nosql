that pie-date modern art. “Portraiture
as a medium of artistic expression has been largely forgotten in the era of selﬁes. This
'
exhibition is an attempt to
bring back some of the
lost glory of this artistic
practice, In the earlier
days. it was a sign of ‘j
wealth, where the patron
would call upon the artist
to showcase them at their
best and it would take months and probably years to
- get that perfect portrait. Today's
" » world is digital and instant, many
don't understand the charm behind a
work painstakingly created by hand.
There is much more than what meets the
eye. 1 create paintings from directly
observing the nature. and deliberately
avoid the use of photography or other
mechanical aids in my artistic prac~
tice."

I

er and artist, Rishabh Sud
says his father always wanted to hold an exhibition of
his own as an artist before his

charcoal and oil as a
medium of expression.

manship can be seen In
his portraits.
The collection also
'aces the technical

Journey of portraits as a medium of art.
Rishabh says. "I am a classically trained
artist and to master the skill l have been
working in this medium since the last
eight years. 1 have used painting iiieth~
ods inspired from old masters such as
Rembrandt. Sargent. Zorn. Annigonni.
Bonnat and Raja Ravi Verma. to name a
few. but with a modern approach. I have
combined techniques from both impressionisman academic art to create a
style of my own."
Portraits aim to capture the character
istic of a person for centuries together,
states Rishabh. He adds. “It brings out
the sitter’s unique sense of individuality,
which allows the viewer an insight into
their characters. After all. the person
will grow old, but the portrait
doesn't." Talking about his
technique he says. “I have
spent the last eight years
training in classical realism m Florence, and 1
_ wanted to showcase the
, beauty of a technique. so I
did not rush through the
course, instead I mastered
the skill. For me skill is
more important. one can
automatically master the technique through practice."
For this exhibition some prominent
people like Maharaja Hira Singh of
Nabha, ace fashion photographer
Heinant Khandelwal, actors Virat and
Aamir Raza Husain. director Muzaffar
Ali and his wife Meera. volunteered as
his muse.
Taking about his subjects. he says, "I
work hard to develop paintings that
speak both to me and to the viewer about
the inner beauty that exists inside the
subject. Part of my process before 1
begin painting is to research. sit and
communicate with my subject and know
as_ much as 1 can about them so I can
bring that on the canvas. I do not merely want to capture an image with my
brushes, rather with careful.
colourful strokes 1 want to recre»
atc that moment in time"
Reﬂecting on the present
state of por aiturc art in
liidia. he states. “We are

of 81'11५111' practice,"
