Citing 'rising intolera e' in the
iécountry, noted Kannada litterateur and social activist Devanur
Mahadeva onSaturday said he

would be returning his Padma
Shri and Sahitya
awards.
He said returning
awards now was only
as he would be unable

Akademi
of these“
a gesture
to return

the indirect beneﬁts he has enjoyed from these awards and
feels constricted for it.
"Against my personal behav'iour', I remained patient even as
many authors and literary figures returned their awards, raising their voice 'against intoler-

ance in the country, but I'm feeling disgusted after few writers
and artists stoOd in support of

those in power," Mahadeva said
in a statement.
He alleged that the principles of
free speech, tolerance and social
justice on which India gained independence has been shrinking
after the Nehruvian period.
"These principles are the
breath for cultural and social India that we have to construct, but
unfortunately there is intolerance spréading in the country
without understanding any of
this," Mahadeva added.
Known for his work in Dalit literature, he was honoured with
Kendra Sahitya Akademi award

for his novel "Kusuma Baale" in
1990 and conferred with Pad'ma
Shri in 2011.
Mahadeva, without naming
anybody, also criticised leaders
of the Union Government for
branding return of awards by literary personalities as their intolerance against Prime Minister
Narendra Modi.
‘
He said those forces spreading
intolerance in the country feel
'protected' by the central government, because of which they are
openly indulging in acts that are
disturbing peace. "Current central government will have to in- ५
trospect about this to be able to
provide good governance," he
added.
