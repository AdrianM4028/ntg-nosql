uvamalata Ran, the head of lndjan
music programming at Mumbai's
National Centre for the Performing
Arts (NCPA), had one clear objective in
putting together the shows for NCPA's
Suﬁ festival Sarna’a: The Mystic Ecstasy,
They had to be representative of“how
Suﬁ droughts are expressed through
multiple arts?
Accordingly, the three-day festival,
which starts today, will screen the ﬁlm

Ziya Azazi, and musical performances in
the classical and folk traditions as

Rao. “Yet he understands the meaning of
every spin and every step. He has chore

Amzi, who was also part ofthe Sama'a
programme lasr year, says he has focused
on the philosophical aspect of Suﬁsm.
“Suﬁsm starts by asking how and why
man appeared on earth. And when we
can 't ﬁnd a satisfactoryanswer to that
question, it leads to a certain kind of
