ringing the city’s
culture calendar for
' the year to a close,
NCPA’s annual
festival, Centrestage, is one of
the most anticipated drama
events in Mumbai. In the past,
the festival has featured multilingual plays from across the
country. Previous editions
have seen performances by
veteran thespians Om Puri,
Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana
Azmi, etc. Talking about the
USP of the festival, Deepa ५
, Gahlot, head of theatre programming, NCPA, says,
“Centrestage is a festival of
premiering productions. So

there’s always a sense of
mystery around the plays. We
thrive on fresh content, and

though the audience may be
aware of the theatre groups,
they are in for something
unexpected always. This sets
Centrestage apart from
the rest.”

edition will see popular theatre actors don the director’s
