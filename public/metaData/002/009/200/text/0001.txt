Pearly 20th century is
remembered for the
poet-novelist-essayist Amrita

Pritam. Her creativity came
forth when she started
writing at the age of 11, to
deal with loneliness after her

Though she was much older

says Dr Lavlin 'I‘hadani,
recollecting the time when
she was first cast as Amrita in
the play by director MS
Sathyu.
From the engaging poetry

incorporates all aspects of her
life and her sublime love with
writer Imroz. “What Amrita
couldn’t say about herself is
said by my character,” says
Maneesh Manoja, who person-

iﬁes ‘Waqt’ in the production.
Written by Danish Iqbal
and produced by Impresario
Asia, the play has gained
popularity among Delhi’s

theatre crowd due to the r
interesting life that the poetess lived. Lavlin explains: “At
the age of 16, she got married,

at 20, she fell in love with
Sahir (Ludhianvi, poet) and at
25, she was a mother of two.
She still maintained a very

caring relationship with
Imroz in the times when livein was not even heard of. Her
only motive was to be happy
and keep others happy”
Since the script is based on
the poetess’ autobiography,
the play is all the more
intriguing. As Lavlin
recreates the late poet’s mannerisms, the play transcends
. viewers into the 20th century
poetic World of Punjab.
