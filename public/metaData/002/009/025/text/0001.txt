Over theyears, Parsi theatre has staged tales through dance and drama —

and itsproa'aetions have had an impact on Indian cinema
larger—than-Iife depictions of the world,
almost unbelievable stories (everyone
knows Aamir Khan can't race trains),

and their song-and-dance routines.
These qualities have come from
Parsi theatre, the sometimes zany

stories of which are being revived in
current times.

The Buckingham Secret has
members of the British royal family

the public eye, as they are supposedly
of Darsi blood. Pappa Mane Pannavo

Yes. Entertaining? Yes. Stage artistes

And you've probably seen something
similar on the big screen.

I name that comes to mind is
Shakespeare; think of the

Indian stage and you can't ignore
Parsi nataks. For whether it is the
plays of Adi Marzban or the madcap
comedies of Dinyar Tirandaz, each one
has entertained audiences for years.
Though theatre in India can be traced
back to the times of Sanskrit dramatist
Kalid'asa's plays, it's with Darsi theatre
mandalis that drama developed in
colonial times. The British had a great
influence on the small community that
adapted Shakespearean plays in India
— complete with songs and dances —
for the first time in the 18505. Soon,
the theatre groups started performing

in Gujarati, Urdu and Hindi, and these
became precursors of the masala
movies that Bollywood churns out
year after year.
LIGHTS, CAMERA, STORY
Many families' Parsi New Year

celebrations are incomplete without
an evening of watching a nata k.

The stories the plays tell are often
light-hearted, sometimes crazy, and
most of all, entertaining — but many
come with a social message too. And
what more does one want from films?
For the cinemagoer, having a good
time is paramount and like the natak, a
Bollywood production promises hours
of it. Hindi films are known for their

Indian epics, and a little folk

drama —— l—lindi movies have a mix
of influences — and parsi theatre is
a major ingredient of the recipe too.
From Raja Harishchanclra that ran for
over 4,000 shows to tales like Shirin
Farhacl and Arabian Nights, their plays
were on a massive scale. These stories

soon seeped into 35mm — India's first
full-length silent feature was Paja
l—larishchandra, and was said to be an
adaptation of its theatrical namesake.
Though movies in the early 1900s were
silent, musical pieces, costumes, sets
and even gestures were adapted from
the stage.
So whether it is the music and
dances or the melodramatic acting, we
love our Bollywood movies for their
uniqueness — and Parsi theatre could
take some credit for that! 0
