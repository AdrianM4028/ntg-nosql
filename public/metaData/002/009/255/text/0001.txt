theatre scene

t is safe to say that veteran thespians
Alyque Padainsee and Dolly Thakore‘s
son, Quasar Tliakore Padamsee,
literally grew up on'stage. It was, then,
only natural for him to follow in his

parents’ footsteps, and collaborate
with them. However, although he pursued
the same vocation, he chariipioried a cause

has BVOIVed

of his own — youth theatre. Under his

over the 'टाडा

tutelage, Thespo (his initiative) prospered
and emerged as an important platform for

10 years

young, aspiring artistes. Here, he revisits
some of his most cherished memories and
challenges, and discusses the future of
city’s theatre scene.
4‘ पु 4 How have the last 10 years

been for you in theatre?
I have been living a
dream. I have been
fortunate to work
with some wonderful
international directors.
_ Our company, Q’I‘P
' (Quasar Theatre
Productions), has
produced a few shows
that we are very proud
of. Thespo has also
grown by leaps and
bounds.

Quasar Thakore
Padamsee (right)
says. “Theatre in
Mumbai is poised to
become part of the
mainstream."

Venues like the
NCPA. Prithvi
Theatre(above).
St Andrew's
Auditorium and
Sophia Bhabha
Auditorium are all
booked to capacity;
a rehearsal still

What have been the biggest challenges?
The paucity of venues is a major
concern. Muinbai is becoming rriore and
more locality based. You go to cinemas
and m'alls that are near you. But in the
civic planning, no thought has been
given to theatre spaces. The ridiculous
licensing policies make it harder for
informal spaces to be converted into

from All J (far right)

venues. The NCPA (Nariman Point).

Prithvi Theatre (.luhu), St Andrew's
Auditorium (Bandra) and Sophia
Bhabha Auditorium (lireach Candy)
are all booked to (aparity. That's
surely a sign that we need to build more
theatres, Freedom of speech is becoming
a challenge too. Even if all the necessary
permissions are in place. a show can be
stopped by dissen'ing groups, This was
what happened wrh Evarn‘s production,
Ali J, last year.
How has the theatre scene changed?
Theatre in Mumba i is poised to become
part of the mainstream. Today. there
are iriore plays that are about us and
our world. and not narrowed from
western culture. What has been most
remarkable is the number of new arts
managers, who take care of all sorts of
work outside mourning the production.
This position never existed before.
What do you think have been the changing

factors?
I think the Writer‘s Bloc (WB)
workshops would be one of therri,
especially since they cater to new
writing. They help \iriters say what they
want in a coherent I irrn. Even Thespo
has been an agent oi change. ’I‘he'overall
theatre scene is much younger no“.
Sanina Kapoor (theatre personality) and
Sameera Iyengar (co-founder of a
theatre company called Junoon) have
also been strong agents of change.
Where do you see this scene heading in the

next 10 years?
Today. we have shows that are
commercial (Blame It On Yashraj, Jesus
Christ Superstar, etc). non-commercial,
but insanely successful (Vagina
Monologues. Class Of 84, etc). pseudo
experimental (plays staged at NCPA's

Experimental Theatre and Prithyi
Theatre), as well as informal ones tiizit
happen in bars. cafes and art guller 1७५
That is a very diverse range of work i
see technology becoming a more
important player in theatre. it will I'Ll'ww
the production value of the shows.
What have been the biggest highs and lows
in the past 10 years?
Personally, there has not been a low. But
for theatre, as a whole. the assing away
of S.ii\'1itlt‘\' Dittiey ("hr .2", -^ दृरे'ब्बा ‘ ५८ ‘
Lllld the :ii'r: ५! कां st up: 1 ‘ ३८ ८५५
of Kabir Kala Manch (cultural
organisation) were real lows.
On the personal front, the biggest
high was performing our play, So Many
Socks, about Tibetan refugees for the
community at an open-air basketball
court in Dharamshala (H iniachzil
Pradesh). That was unbelievable. It is
among my best experiences in theatre.
along with performing in Stratfordupon~Avon, UK, or at a ZOOO-year-old
amphitheatre in Verona, Italy.
