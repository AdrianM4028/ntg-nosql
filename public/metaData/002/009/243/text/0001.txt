rnarionette who wants to become a real
boy. The inquisitive and naughty puppet
keeps getting into mischief, and is unable
to lie about it, for his nose grows long '
every time he does. After joining the
circus and getting swallowed by a shark,
will Pinocchio ever tell the truth and get
his wish granted by the blue fairy?
