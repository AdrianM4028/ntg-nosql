hen the Experitnertter
Curators' Hub was ﬁrst
conceived itt 201 l as a platforrn to develop and sustain dis—
course on curatorial practice and
exhibition making. Pro Helvetia-the
Swiss Arts Council, art associate,
proposed that they contribute by
inviting an international curator
arourtd wltotrt the event would pivot.
'We didn't want a hierarchy to the
event and told them so. They were
absolutely line. Instead ofone person
talking dawn to the rest. we wanted the
event to be more interactive," says Prateelt Raia. ctr-founder of Kolkata's
Experimertter gallery. which isalso the
venue for the three-day programme
starting on 23 July.
The curator-centric event, unique
irt India’s art calendar, is now held
annually. Based irt a city well-known
lor Its udda culture of ltttpromptu
and freewheeling discussions, Raja
and his wife Priyanka, a ctr-founder,
opted for seamless interactions
between curatorsand the audience.
Previous years have seen the curator-audience interactions spill over
to the chaiu/allah's stall outside the
gallery in south Kolkata. In all likeliv
hood. there will be a repeat of the
scene when the ﬁfth edition takes
place next week.
A third day has been added to

what was earlier a two-day affair
(primarily to address concerns on
time constraints). Over the three
days, 10 curators, including Tasneem Zakaria Mobil, honorary
director of Mumbal's Dr Bltau Dail
Lad Mumbai City Museum and vicechairpersort of the Indian National
Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage:
Eugenio Viola. art critic and curatorat»large at Madre museum in Naples,
Italy; Doryun Chang, chiefcurator at
Hortg Kong's M+ museum; and Glovanni Carmin, director of Switzer-

land's Kunst Hall: SInkt Gallen, will '
deliberate and makl presentations
which will also touch on the concept
of time in art.
'We have invited curators who
have worked across Iitrm. Not physi-

cally but who could juxtapose an
over a period of time.~ says Rafa.
As an example, Ma cites Mumbai-born lirlsh 1८111!!- One of the
participating curators. Kallﬂl, the
curator for the second Kochl-Muziris
Biennale, has worhd on the history
of Koclti as a trading port, and how
artists have responded to It.
