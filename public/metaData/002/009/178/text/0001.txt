‘ sised on the striking realities

the most latent being a
woman’s sexuality.
The play narrates the story
ofa woman locked in her
home by her obnoxious hus-

band. Virtually alone, Sheron
(Marwah) is accompanied by

herbaby, lover and aparalysed-but—perverted brotherin-law in the story. These associations, along with her

abusive husband, proved
to be exhausting for her till

the end.

Sheron’s inner turmoil is
about not having anyone to
talk to; or being able to love.

; Married off when she hadjust
passed out from school and

logue, her experience with
her husband was like “a dry
land being boredwith a
drilling machine”. The dialogues are as bold and sardonic as one can imagine,
and as the show progressed it
gets higher in intensity.
Sheron talks to the audience openly as if talking to a
neighbour, or as a matter of
fact, herself. The ﬁrst scene
opens with her dancing like a
maniac on loud Bollywood
songs, as if‘no one’s watching
-- an act many try when they
are alone in a room, but

would be too embarrassed to
do in public. Her odd
behaviour makes ‘a’ woman
alone, realistic and relatable
with ‘Women Alone’in the
real world. Sheron is indeed a

story, adapted by Arvind
Gaur, was originally written

by Nobel laureate Dario F0
and his spouse Franca Rame.
The writers seem to have

imagined the audience as the
one who fear to see their parents as sexual beings, let

alone a woman with kids.
After nearly an hour of
comical dialogues that leave
the audience in splits and
make them forget the dark

content of the play, when
Sheron, in the end, is bombarded with bitter realities,

she loses her sanity. This
weird, yet wonderful, character reminds of a lonely
woman, one would hate
to become.
