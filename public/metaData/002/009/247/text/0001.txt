Art isn't always what we see

amund us. It is also what evades
e; … our eyes. We may have been
enchanted by several forms and styles of
art through the ages. but there remain
some forms that we are still relatively
unfamiliar with The Japanese art of
‘higirie is one such form. It is a technique that involves tearing pieces of
paper and creating larger. collagelike
images by pasting them onto a surface.
The paper bits work like individual
brushstrokes and come together to form
shapes. hues and shades that can barely
be distinguished from an actual painting on a canvas from a distance.

}"‘I was posted in Japan and lived
t ore for almost 20 years." Ray
says. r
ing his introduction
to the art form. It is believed
that Chigiri-e was born
out of the devastation following the Second World
ar in Japan. It was first '
conceived by an artist '
who put together a few
assorted
scraps
of
paper to depict hope in
a time of despair and
decrepitude. It was
meant to evoke a sense
of revival among the
Japanese. and this sentiment seems to come
through even in the

works Ray has put on display, such as

Talking about why
this particular technique of torn paper
appeals to him. he
says. “It came to my
notice during my

stay in Japan, Out there. departmental
stores organise a lot of exhibitions. l
was exposed to this form through one of
them. I used to carry my sketch book to
these exhibitions every time in any case.
and was deeply inspired."
The artist put together his first
Chigiri-e exhibition in Kobe, Japan in
2011 and then again in 2014. This exhibition in Delhi is his ﬁrst Chigiri—e style
showcase in India. “Since this exhibition is being organised in my country. I
am putting up some of my best works,"
he affirms.
An element in each of the works on
display that reaches out to the spectator
almost immediately is the artist's
engagement with nature, Ray nods and
shares that he has always been nature's
ardent observer. “My oollege was across
the Ganges. Sitting on the bank of the
river. I used to watch the sunset everyday. पिसा।। here. my tryst with nature
began." he reminisces.
The artist is also keen on spreading
this art form in India and generating
greater awareness about it. “As of now. I
have no particular plans in place but I
will surely be looking for a chance to get
in touch with interested people through
this exhibition." he concludes.
