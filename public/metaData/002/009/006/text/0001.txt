Bharatnatyam
'10r close to a decade,
Praveen Kumar has been

researching forexpressions and compositions that
are male-oriented, so thathe
can effectivelyportray varied
emotions on stage through
the classical dance form —

a Bharatnatyam dancer, tells
Metrolife. A common miscon-

echoed by Lokesh Bharadwaj

ception among many is that

who has been hearing about

this classical dance form,

this divide ever since he started leai'ning Bharatnatyam.
The ambiguous role ofamale I

which originated in the ternples of Tamil Nadu, is limited
to women dancers.
“I always wantedto break

but the Delhi-based dancer

people should be taking about
the “role ofa dancer”.

' “I can talk about howI
feel...and I can saythat I love

dancing because it gives me a
high. It is extremely satisfying,” he adds.

Coming together on one

stage at “Purushaakaram: The
Male in Bharatanatyam”, the

upcoming monsoon festival of
dance, some of them would be

turning into nayz'kas andsome
would be portraying subdued
male emotions. For instance,
one ofPraveen’s compositions
is about a man who is married,
but is in pursuit ofanother
woman. He leaves his wife for
her, but the other woman
leaves him for another man.
The cycle completes and he is

shattered, and leaves for
Kashi(V'aranasi) to wash away
his sins.
Whereas Vijay’s composition is Nanda Stat/2i that generally depicts sarcasm. So in
this piece, the poet is asking
God a question why he is indifferentto him when he hasn’t

done any wrong. In another
piece, this 25-year-old dancer

will play the role ofHanuman
and Sita and emote the former’s “brotherly” feeling for
the later.
“Dance is not just for
dancers, but for an audience
in the auditorium. So one has

to think ofways to keep them
engaged,” says Vijay.
