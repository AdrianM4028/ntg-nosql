“The Merchant of
Venice” is the second
offering of Aadyam,
presented at its festival
organised at Kamani
auditorium by Mumbaibased Masque this past
week. The deminant mood
the production tends to
' evoke is that of antagonism
between Christianity and
Judaism.
In contrast, act ﬁve,
which captures a joyous

appears to be less effective.
In fact, this act with its
happy ending should have
been powerful enough to
convey the life affirming
humanism of Shakespeare. '

play in a bar.
The original play opens in
a street in Venice. Here in the bar Bassanio tells his
friend Antonio, a merchant
