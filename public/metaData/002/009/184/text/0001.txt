MURDER MESTRI — . क्ष
PANKAJ PADGHAN
ZEE MUSIC MARATHI :;.:; 1: 3. .: 1:. :. : . : .12-17
With only;three tracks on
_ the list, there is not much scope for
variety but the album has some
beautiful music from Pankaj
Padghan complemented well by
Asha Bhosle and Adarsh Shinde’s
voices. Alimili has Asha Bhosle
singing in her unique style and one
never gets enough of her voice".
_Next up is Adarsh Shinde’s San—
shayacha Kida which is laced with
thoughts from the mind of a suspicious ‘person..Shinde returnson the
last song Jivala Laglay Ghor, a funny number, high on ghungroo and g ८
dholki beats fused in a rock-like
composition. While Alimili scores
well, the other two tracks are just
average.
