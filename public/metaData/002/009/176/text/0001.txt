Theatre . isha's

adaptation of a
German play
looks at peoples'

most basic desire
RA VE E NA JOSEPH
We are all similar in our primal
instincts, irrespective of race
and class. And despite the
boundaries we set for ourselves, these instincts that

make us human will always
connect us. Theatre Nisha’s
Ring-a Ring-a Roses, inspired
by Arthur Schnitzler’s German

play Reigen, portrays a cycle of
sexual encounters that reveals
precisely this.
Though the original play
was published in 1900, the one
staged at Alliance Francaise
over the weekend, directed by
V. Balakrishnan, was adapted
for Chennai’s audience and
came interspersed with local
lingos and references.

The play is a series of encounters between pairs of people. First, a sex worker engages
a small-time actor in conversation. He takes what she has
to offer and leaves, unapologetically, without giving any—
thing in return. The next is the
encounter between the same
actor and a woman he meets at
a party — he woos her patiently and once she gives in, changes his tone and hurriedly
leaves her. In the following
scene, the same woman from
the party goes on to meet an

established theatre actor look—
ing for a role, and another
rendezvous unfolds. It goes on
and on, revealing more such
encounters — the theatre actor’s affair with a married
woman, the married woman’s

relationship with her husband,
her husband’s transgressions
with a blind woman and so on
and so forth — till it all comes a
full. cycle.
Each actor is shown having
two sexual encounters, with
each revealing different shades of their character. Different
people, from diverse backgrounds, with myriad motives
and aspirations, are connected
by their most basic desires.

The situations are relatable
and the dialogues, even more
so. The unapologetic use ofTa—
mil made many moments raw
and hard—hitting, and some
others cheeky and funny.
The nuances of the characters make them compelling
and believable, and the actors
do a remarkable job in bringing them to life. Mee‘ra Sitaraman
gives
a
powerful
performance as the poor blind
woman, who comes home with
a man whose scent she liked,
whose words she enjoyed and
whom she decided to trust.
he overpowers her co-actor,
Ganapathy Murugesan, even
though he gives a commendable performance. Sainath
Saikrishnan beautifully portrays the different shades of
his character — ﬁrst when he
artistically seduces a woman
who comes to him for help and
then, when he helplessly

struggles with a married woman he’s desperate to please.
Kasturi Goswami is delightful
to watch as the whimsical actress who is insistent on roleplaying with a rather confused
Prateeksha Chandrasekharan,
who also delivers a solid
performance.
The scenes are connectedby
the narrator Sandeep John,
who, in his beautifully boom—
ing voice, recites nursery
rhymes between encounters
with a slight smirk; drawing
attention to the satire in each
situation.
'
Shakti Ramani wraps up the
play with a punch as the sex
worker who giggles easily at
the men she meets and rather
helplessly at her own situation. Even as the ﬁnal nursery
rhyme is rendered, she arranges to meet with another
man, keeping the cycle of sexual encounters going.
