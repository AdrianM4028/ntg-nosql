came to see it and asked me
when we’re bringing it to

weren’t, she thought that was
unfair. She then talked to
Ashvin Gidwani who offered
to produce it. We’ve now
completed almost 65 shows.

as magical as ﬁlms. From
1985-1993, I extensively did
theatre. My ﬁrst major play

was A Viewfrom the Bridge
by Arthur Miller.

When I was in my ﬁrst year
ofcollege, my friend said,
that since we had no money
for a ﬁlm, we should try
theatre. A play has
everything —— a story,
dialogues, performances. I
thought it would be good
practice for us and we would
also get money forthe
camera we needed. That’s

Five years before I did 2 to

brainwave. I thought I could
make a ﬁlm, but I didn’t
know how. So I talked to my
friends and I came up with a
theory. My brother had a still
camera which could take 16
photographs. I thought a ﬁlm
is after all a series of photos,
so if we bought rolls, then we
could keep clicking pictures,
run it through a projector,
and it would be aﬁlm. But we

Some six years back, I
experienced a writer’s block
for the ﬁrst time. I was
scared all the time and I
began questioning
everything. I called a friend,
who is my age, and he told he
was going through the exact
same thing. We started
discussing it and I realised

Tango, 3 to Jive, I kept telling
myself that I would do
something in theatre but it
never materialised. One day I
posted on Facebook that I
wanted to do a play in Delhi.
I needed some money to put
it together. A few boys in
Delhi who work in the
corporate sector responded.
So I wrote this play and
started rehearsing. When the

३ When I started out, there
was absolutely no money in
theatre. If you could do seven
shows, it meant the play was
a super-hit. Now we have
done 65 shows and we can
perform even more. Earlier,
people wouldn’t even spend
Rs. 5 on a ticket. But today,
the most expensive tickets
are the fastest sold. People 5
are willing to pay that kind of
money to see plays and that
is amazing.
