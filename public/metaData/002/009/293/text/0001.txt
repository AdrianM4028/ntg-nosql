activist in him alive. A journalist by profession, theatre gives
him a chance to channelise his
thoughts. “People have a notion
that journalists writing on
films. lifestyle, fashion and
other ﬁner aspects are not doing
serious kind of journalism.
Though I can’t report on crime
and politics, I can channel it
through my writing and fulﬁll
my
social
responsibility."
Arnesh says.
A quirky name for a classic
adaptation, Arnesh explains the
concept behind Murgistaan.
“The play is protesting against
the absurdity and political highhandedness of the authorities.
Everyone in the Murgistaan
kingdom is being fooled. The
tagline of the play reads Kacche
Din aa gay'e — the worst that
would happen to a chicken dish
is that the chicken remains raw.
We know where this comes
from. We were expecting the

director I have worked with so
government to do
some good, but we
are still waiting ~for it to happen," . ‘_
he says.

A contemporary ‘retelling of a Inas- ‘L
terpiece was not "
much of a burden
on the director’s
shoulders, he says.
“Ray is an extremely important ﬁgure in my life.
I’m comfortable with his material because I. have been reading
him since the time I learnt reading. I know where the man is
coming from. I share an intimacy with the text I'm adapting. If
he were alive I would have definitely told him to watch my play

far. We are more of friends now है

kind of master storyteller that
he was, the retelling would have
been long done by him.”
His actors in Murglstaan were
his friends first. Having worked
with him in his ﬁrst play
Asylum as well. they are well
acquainted with his style of
working. "Arnesh is the best

actually. He is the most sorted guy I have come across who is
very clear with his vision and
knows what he wants.” says
Suhas Chatkara who plays a
common man in the stage show.
Delnaz Divecha plws a student
revolting against the autocratic
government. "Arnesh just doesn’t teach you to be good in his
play; he grooms you to be a better actor. In Murgistaan the
characters are very relatable.
The discussions we had while
rehearsing enhanced our characters."

Having not seen their son
smile or laugh even once
till he was ﬁve years old,
made Arnesh Ghose’s parents
wonder if their child had some
medical condition. 'I‘ill one fine
afternoon this house in Kolkata
was echoing with laughter. It
was this director, now 26 years
of age, chuckling. He was
watching the ghost dance in
\ Satyajit Ray’s Gupi Gyne Bagha
३ Byne. His adulation for Ray will
now come on stage in the form
. of Murgr‘staan — an adaptation
of Ray‘s 1980 classic Hirak Rajar
Deshe.
The love for theatre and Ray
runs in the family. His father
runs a successful theatre group
in Kolkata and being brought up
in a theatrically driven environment, writing, reading and acting came naturally to him. It is
also a means of keeping the
