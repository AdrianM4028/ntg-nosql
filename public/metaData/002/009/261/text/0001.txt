This reyiewer has been witness to
the "dance form of Bengal" from
the time it was a rrtere ﬂedgling. l
reiterate that etidertce of dance
poses found in tire Ananta Vasudeva
temple irt Hoogltly cannot be takert
as en'dence of gaudiya nrirya being
the source of the other dance forms
of India. because recorded history
states, although there were human
settlements in Bengal front prehistoric t‘tmes, there is no
archeological evidence to show the
existence of any kind of dance
form. The identity of the fornt
cannot be established With just
wielding a yak-tail-whisk used in
temples for worship or uni and
carrying a ﬂower basket and
dancing on a well decorated burnt
earthen pot. To quote dance scholar
I 'tpal banerjee. “it (gaudiya nritya)
Will need to look signiﬁcantly
different front other dance forms of
|ndia. "
But the question of gaudiya
rtritya, which ltas been supposedly
found by Moltua Mukhopadhyay as
a result of her sustained research,
tells a different story. Her clairrt that
it is “the mother of all the classical
dance forms of india" must be
scrutinised by scholars and
historians. However, the good news
is that thanks to Mukhopadhyay's
