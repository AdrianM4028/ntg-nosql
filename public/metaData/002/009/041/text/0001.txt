presented 'Zameen Ka Sawaal' a
play in Hindi today at Natang
Studio Theatre in its weekly'theatre series, Sunday Theatre.
चु The play has been written by
Partap Sehgal and directed by
Neeraj Kant. It was a hard hitting satire on the socio-political
situation of the Country and carried a very relevant message
which was very well received by
the audience»
The play 'Zameen Ka Sawaal'
opens in a trial room where a
high level committee is enquir—
ing about a very grim incident
where ﬁve people at different
locations were killed by sending
letter-bombs. 'Ranganathan' a
very senior scientist is accused of
master-minding the crime as all
the evidence were against him.
Initially he does not admit having involved in the crime but
when given a false news that his

a harsh frustration in his mind,
he asserts that only hard work
and ability will take you
nowhere in this system, where
corruption and favoritism are
deep-rooted. The play very brilliantly says that those who do
not have approach and recommendation may not be given
higher positions but it does not
mean that they are not talented
enough.

Artists who performed in the
only son is also killed in the
same manner, he breaks and
with a deep agony in the heart,
he admits his crime which he
had committed to take revenge
from all those who were responsible for hurdles in his growth
and promotion.

Despite being the most outstanding and deserving scientist

having dedicated entire life in
research, he was denied his due
recognition and promotion as it
was granted to someone else who
had a close proximity with the

political hierarchy. This renders

play included Syed Mudassar Ali
Shah, AShWani Bali, Rajan
Thakyal, Mahikshit Singh, ‘Rohit
Sharma, Abhee Bargotra and
Pankaj Verma. Lights were
designed by Neeraj Kant. Mohd.
