Story telling is an effective educationaltool
as a foundation for learning and teaching,

enhancing mental
skills in children, now
lost as parents ﬁnd little time to spend with
their
children.
Nuclear families have
further killed this art दृ
with no grandparents
around to tell stories.
Parents buy free
time for themselves by
allowing children to
watch long hours of
television and computer gaming, alienating themfrom their
near ones, leading to
aggression, irritabil. ८s
ity and quarrelsomeness .
’I‘o revive the art
of storytelling, wellknown storyteller
Kamal Pruthi has ,_
initiated a Storytelling Movement in collaboration with schoolsof Delhi/NOR. These ticketed performances are likely to be interactive, open to the entire neighbourhood. The
performances will begin with the very successful Kabuliwala by Kamal Pruthi which
has so far done 48 performances through '7
states for over 5000 children.
