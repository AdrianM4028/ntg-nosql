came to artist Hasrnukh Baradi, 78, over a decade ago
with bags full of theatrerelated properties of Nayak,
Baradi realised the need for
setting up a theatre archive.
“They told me it was becoming difﬁcult for them to maintain costumes, manuscripts,
books, and as a theatre personality I may be able to better use and preserve such archival material, " says Baradi,
Founder-Director of Theatre
and Media Centre ('I‘MC) in
Ahrnedabad, where training
in theatrical arts is imparted.
“Many grandchildren of
Gujarati theatre doyens also _
told me they wanted me to
look after their ancestral collection. This led to my thinking of creating a resource
of theatre archives but at
the time I did not have the
space," Baradi shares.
“By 2007,with the support
oflocal and national govern—
ment authorities we moved
into a campus with repertory
theatre and training facilities, such as, indoor experimental
theatre, children's theatre,
etc. I began to work on creating an archive that could be
used as a research resource
for theatre students, enthusiasts and artists, " he says.
Baradi received a doctorate irr theatre from the Lunacharsky Theatre Institute,
Moscow in 1971. He collected
many gramophone records
