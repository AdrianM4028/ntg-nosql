What inspired you to direct an
adaptation from Tagore‘s Shzy 7
I was invited byHappenings Kulkata to
direct aplay fortheir festival, Rabi ndra
Utsav. As I create works for children
and young people. 1 looked for a story
by Tagore thatwould work forthis age
group. When I came upon Shay. l was
very tempted to bring alive the and
lies, literally! Andthat is how thejourney

Shey is veryclose to my heart. 1 am also
very fond of myplays Kyun-Kyun Ladki and Mister Jeejeebhoy and the
Bit
What should the audience expect
when theygo to see the play?
In She-Haskell, the audience can expect to See another interpretation of
Tagore’s writings and paintings. We
have used a lot of stylised movements
for storytelling, Itis done per se dance
theatre, but hassome elementsthat {all
in thatgenre. What arcites me most is
that Shey is very un-T'agore like. So a
lot in the play willbe surprising forthe
audience.

there are orgamsa’tions trying to lake
cinema to schools. But the volume of

In what श्या do theatre workshops beneﬁt the children?
Drama workshops are one wayof engaging ' children using theatre med:niques. Itgives them the opportunity
' tial learning and a healthy
safe space to arth relationships with
people andthe world aroundthem. Any
art based workshop pments a young
mind with multiple क्या on a
