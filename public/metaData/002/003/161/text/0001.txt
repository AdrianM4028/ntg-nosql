on installations that highlighted
political, social and environmental

question which comes to mind is:
Are not Kabir Das, poet and saint

unlikely bedfellows? John’s explanation meanders through the

meaning of life, the teachings of
the "two mystic saints”, and the
perseverance of a pregnant bird to
find the safest place to layits egg.
But exactly how did he discover
Kabir’s poetry that was written in
vernacular Hindi of that period?

instrumental in inspiring John to
do the series that also assimilated
the teachings of Francis Assisil “l
was born into a Christian family so
I knew about St Francis Assisi and
his love for trees, birds, animals
and nature," says John, who as a
young student studied to been

priest but decided against it.
At this point, John clarifies that
his paintings are not literal articu—

lations of the poetry. instead, the
verses were triggers for ideas,

which "internalised in me and
grew to become my own" .
Then there are the pregnant
birds that are the recurring motifs
in all the displayed paintings. He
elaborates, "Look at how the birds
make their nests in hostile conditions with an urgency. The love
and care they take tobring the eggs

to life is amazing. To me, the bird
becomes a symbol of life. ”
