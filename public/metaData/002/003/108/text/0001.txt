Padamshri awardee,
Shovana Narayan. The day
there will be no Kathak, she
says she too will cease to
exist. Disciple of Pandit Birju
Maharaj, Narayan is a well

known choreographer and
performer today. She

recently performed at the
Lalit Arpan Festival at India
Habitat Centre. _ …
Speaking about the
festival, she says, “Generally
this ,dgtnce festival includes
youngf‘people but this time at
the festival we were all
senior artistes.”

Narayan has
choreographed many
performances and it is hard

for her to pick one as her
favourite. “There are many
Kathak performances that I
have choreographed and

danced. I love the ones based
on the philosophy of life.
There is another one on
‘Yashodhara’ which I like and

keep doing. Even the ones
based on the several
incidents from the life of
Buddha are wonderful,”
she explains.
An inspiration to many
artistes, Narayan says, “Be it

a young Kathak dancer or
someone pursuing some
other ﬁeld, it is necessary to

know your heritage. Have an
awareness of the heritage
and go into the depth of it.”
She believes that dedication,
hard work and sincerity are
required to excel. “There are

no short-cuts in life to
anything. Another very
