s a teenager; Sanjay
Shesh (now 54) often
accompanied his
playwright father
Dr Shankar Shesh to Hindi
and Marathi dramas. He
didn‘t want to write plays, or
even act in them. But he liked
accompanying his father.
’I‘heir family moved from
Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh)
to Mumbai in the ‘705 because
Shesh, inspired by theatre
director Satyadev Dubey,
wanted to devote his life to
theatre. From 1969 to 1981, the
author penned 22 Hindi plays,
including some popular ones
such as Ek Aur Dronacharya,
Poster and Bin Baati Ke Deep.
Now, 35 years after his father
passed away, Sanjay is
launching a literary initiative
- the Shankar Shesh
Foundation — to honour
Shesh’s work. Two plays,
Kornal Gandhar and Raktbeej,
will be performed at the
NCPA on October 2, which
is Dr Shesh’s birthday.
We talk to Sanjay about
the enterprise as he
rerninisces about his
father’s career, and what
inspired him to write.
How has your father's involvement in theatre inﬂuenced
your family?
My father pursued the arts all
his life. All his sons pursued
engineering. We were exposed

to theatre because it was
written at our house, and
we had people of [literary]
repute visiting us. So, while
theatre wasn’t our primary
interest, we were introduced
to art and culture at home. I
wouldn't say we were keen
theatregoers, but we weren’t
averse to it as well.

Kornal Gandhar and Raktbeej
will be staged at the NCPA,
Narirnan Point, on October 2,
at 4pm and at 7.30pm,
respectively.

What led you to launch the
foundation now?
Our father hasn’t been with
us since 1991 But my mother,
Sudha Shesh, was there. She
would give permission to
those who approached her to
stage his plays. But things
were not organised. Like my
father, she was always willing
to let people perform his
works. We never thought
about royalties. Even today,
we don’t think about it. When
my mother came to live with
us in Mumbai, a group took
her consent to perform one of
my father’s plays in July 2016.
1 accidentally happened to
watch that play inMarathi.
I was so impressed and
enjoyed it so much that I felt
I should do something about
his plays. Unfortunater we
lost our mother soon after
that. When she passed away,
Lthought I should do
something for both of them .
What is the societal and political
context of your father's plays?
What real experiences inspired
him to write them?

He also wrote scripts for

Shankar Shesh
He was associated with
education. While working as a
Hindi professor in Nagpur, he
wrote Ek Aur Dronacharya,
which has been performed
more than 100 times. He wrote
plays that spoke about the
political environment of
education in India. After
his stint with education, he
became part of tribal welfare.
There, he was introduced to
casteisrn in India, which
inspired him to come up with
stories like Bad Ka Pani and
Poster, which was based on
Bastar (a tribal area in
Chhattisgarh). He travelled
a lot in Bastar.

movies...
After he moved to Mumbai, he
wrote the story of Gharaonda
(1977). He realised that you
have to struggle in the city
to have a house of your own.
The film is about that. Then,
when he saw that many of his
friends were getting divorced,
he wrote Dooriyan (1979). He
also wrote the dialogues for
Sridevi’s first movie — Solva
Sawan (1979). It also featured
Am 01 Palekar.

Do you feel Shankar Shesh's
work hasn't received enough
recognition?
My father wrote plays prior
to 1981. He was writing
Hindi plays in a city
where art and culture
was predominantly
Maharashtrian. The people

working with Hindi theatre
were living in Delhi and
Lucknow, and they thought
that since Dr Shesh was living

Shankar Shesh receives his PhD degree from भाणा Lakshm
in Mumbai, he was writing
for ﬁlms. So, I think I should
get him the recognition,
which I don't think he
received [in his lifetime].

What do you hope to achieve
with the foundation?
The idea is to create an
institution around his work.
If a youngster wants to write,
he or she can use this
platform, and write a play
for the Shankar Shesh
Foundation. Today, it’s
difficult to find someone
who has a good idea, a good
script, and also good
dialogue-writing skills. For
example, we want to get 10
people — one person with the
idea, another to write the
script, and a third to write

dialogues, and so on.
Together, we would create
new scripts, plays, stories and
poems. The idea is to
encourage new writers. We
may also contemporise my
father’s literature.

How can a writer apply to
^write to yourfoundation?
We’ll invite playwrights to
write in various languages.
We’ll put together a jury.
I’m the managing trustee.
So, I will choose ﬁve more
trustees and they will select
the people who know how

they want ti) contribute to
Hindi theatre, or creative
writing in any other
language. Writers can apply
directly on our website.
