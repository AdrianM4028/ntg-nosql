CHAN (0111.]1.3]] GHOSE
For Class XII students Agnib, ha Banerjee, Kamala Roy and
Asmita Ganguly, Saturdays
have been the busiest days of
the week since March— every
single one had been bookedfor
rehearsals of Shakespeare’s
Othello.
From auditioning for roles
to beingpart of ﬁ'enetic behindthe-scene actions, the play kept
the outgoing batch of Nava Nalanda Group of Schools engaged for months. They ﬁnally
performed to a full house and
stupendous applause at Rabindra Sadan on August 18. The
occasion: celebration of the institution’s goldenjubilee.
What made the programme even more special was the
fact that the students brought
alive the works of two great
playwrights - Shakespeare
and Rabindranath Tagore.
“This was the first time I
was part of such an elaborate
theatre production,” said an
excited Kamala, who played
Emilia, Iago’s wife and Desde-

Students of Nava Nalanda Group of Schools enact a
scene from Othello. Picture by Arnab Mondal
mona’s maid in the play. She
hadalso been part of the music
score. Standing next to her, Agnibha oozed conﬁdence, much
like his on-stage Othello avatar. “I was not nervous at all. I
enjoyed the process,” he said.
The event began with chief
guests — academicians AnandaLal and Bharati Ray — highlighting the relevance of both
Shakespeare and Tagore in today’s world. “Othello is a commentaryon racism and a country’s social-political scenario
that even we can easily identi—
fy with,” said Lal. Ray felt that

Tagore and Shakespeare were
very different in spirit given
the gulf of years between
them, yet both touched on the
social, political and psychological fabric of their societies
through their works.
In the second part of the
programme, professional singers, including Shreya Guha-

thakurta, Pramita Mallick I
and others, sang songs and recited poems, while primary
and middle school students
danced to Tagore songs and I
music. The eventwas a tribute/
to 'I‘agore’s Gitanjali.
