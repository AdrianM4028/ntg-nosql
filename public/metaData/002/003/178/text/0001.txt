special mention for its, tragic

rof. K. Madavane
has directed about
100 plays in
English, Hindi,

French and
German. His directorial art
seen in Delhi marks a
departure from traditional
approach to the production
of a stage play. His
innovative style is very
much in evidence in his
recent works like Karnad’s
“Tughlaq” and Moliere’s
“'I‘artuffe” which he did for
Shri Ram Centre. The
“Mahabharat Women”
stands out, which he did
about three decades ago, for

its contemporary
interpretation and profound
message.
The Delhi theatre lovers
gave warm response to his
production of William
Shakespeare’s Hamlet in
Hindi translation by Amrut
Rai. It was presented by SRC
Repertory at its auditorium
recently. Apart from the
ingenious style of
presentation, the production
projects Saif Ansari as
Hamlet who makes an
impressive endeavour to
create a tragic character who
struggles to humanise a
world which is like a prison,
petty and malicious. It is a
prison where true love is not
possible to bloom, Imparting

and married Hamlet’s

Hamlet is the longish play
which needs several hours to

a philosophical drama.”
Prof. Madavane is a widely

read and travelled artist. His
dilemma is how to discover
contemporary elements in
the classic without
distorting and vulgarising
the original work. He
emphasizes on the dialogues,
“There is something rotten

in the kingdom of
Denmark”, “Denmark’s a

challenges.

He has removed wings
with a view to enact play on

a bare stage with a vast vista.
But the uses of six wooden
boxes with a height of six
feet placed vertically occupy
much empty space. One

block is placed horizontally
to be used as throne for the

royalty. These blocks are
used as exit and entry points

and as object to hide spies.
The main problem with
these blocks is that with
every scene they are
propelled by the performers
to change their space. In this
proeess they have to come
out of their characters. The
flow of action is also
interrupted. If considered
essential the nilmber of
these blocks should be
reduced. If the director
intends to use these blocks
as a metaphor for prison
walls, these should not have
been frequently shifted from
one space to another.
Another novelty of the
production is the use of light
design. There are no fade
outs and there is no interval.
Blue lights near the wings
remain on throughout the
show.

There is no attempt to
dazzle the audience to create
magic. In fact, the play
demands a variety of lighting
effects to create “mood” to
capture violence, brutality

Prof. Madavane has
worked hard with his cast,

which has little experience
in working Shakespeare's
plays, to make their
performances creditable.
However, the Hindi accent
of the most of the

performers is not up to the
mark. Saksham Shukla as
