Reams of paper and hundreds of
words can be used to describe a
person's life and sorrretirnesit can
be done with just the right footnote
— a note at the bottom of the
page, that explains it all. Seerrringly
random events, involving personal
relationships or chance meetings
with strangers, can at times explain
everything one needs to understand.
Footnotes ofLife, as the name
signifies, is based on these significant
events or excerpts from life that speak
volumes about the unsaid emotions
and undercurrents thatdrive
our relationships and lives.
