" V'almiki has barely put his pen down

to the stage this weekend. The play
is based on a short story by Dr

‘KDIEevdutt Pattanaik and has been
adapted in the nautanki form
(sangeet). It is a part of Gillo
. Repertory Theatre’s series of short
plays for young audiences, using
various theatrical forms. The story
’rEvolv'es around the premise that

creation, the epic Ramayan, when he
realises he has competition. The
sage Narad tells him that there is a

better Ramayan, written by
Hanuman. “In any adaptation, we

take off from what the book offers.
The story is written in Hindi verse in
the adapted version instead of the

dialogue form of the English

original. The play includes more
conversations, particularly between
valmiki and Narad and Valmiki and
Hanuman,” says Shaili Sathyu of
Gillo. A sutradhar (traditional
narrator) brings in the writer’s voice.
“We have included musical operatic
forms from across North India. Post
the show, we also discuss and
demonstrate these forms,” she
summarises.
