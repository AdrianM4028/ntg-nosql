This was the genius of re—
clusive Tamil writer R.
Chudamani’s stories: they
featured characters that almost came alive. Living,
breathing people, with corri—
plex minds that she could
read. And in doing so, she

unveiled a whole spectrum
of emotions that manipulated people.
The
Madras
Players
picked seven such stories for
its play Chudamani, perﬂormed last weekend — the
ﬁrst time the writer’s works
were adapted in English for
the stage.
It was a big responsibility
— adapting Chudamani’s
sensitive portrayal of humankind, especially women.
The Madras Players knew
this and handled it well. The
stories were translated into
English by Prabha Sridevan
and were adapted for the
stage by Nikhila Kesavan,
who also played the whitesari-clad Chudamani. She
spoke about her characters "

The Madras Players brought alive seven vivid short
stories by Tamil writer R. Chudamani

form.
Chudamani was a trip ,,
back in time. When letterwriting and arranged marriages were the norm.
When a father’s most important concern in life was
to get his daughter married
off before she became ‘too

her ageing father — this
story revolves around a man
who offers him a lift in his
car on a hot day in Chennai.
Mahalingam is doing the
rounds with Bhuvana’s horoscope to get her married.
She’sjust 19, but he has started the ‘hunt’ nevertheless,
he tells the we11~off gentleman who takes him to his
destination.
The two meet 15 years lat~
er — but nothing has
changed in Mahalingam’s
life; Bhuvana is still unmar—

ried and he is still visiting
prospective grooms with
her
horoscope.
D.
Ramachandran’s performance as Mahalingam was
powerful and moving.
In fact, the highlight of
Chudamani was the casting.
Krithikaa Shurajit who
played Suganthi, Dharma
Raman who played Kasturi,
P.C. Ramakrishna (the director) who played a visuallyimpaired father... there was
some inspired acting on display.

the

play was a revelation. How
else can one describe their
reaction to the writer’s take

on a lonely young wife’s attraction towards a man who
visits her and her much
older husband? Chudamani

sees these emotions as mere
passing phases; feelings of
inﬁdelity — perhaps a strong
