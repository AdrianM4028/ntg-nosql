1857: Turrebaz Khan written by Padma Shri Mohd. Ali Baig is

a gripping drama of an unsung hero from the Deccan, set
against the backdrop of the Sepoy Mutiny in the 19th centu-

ry. His freedom struggle, revolt against dictatorial rulers and
. his ultimate martyrdom is not just a snapshot of the country’s independence movement, but a universal struggle
between the haves and have-hots.
