F 9' 0M Cockroach

The Fate Of A Cockroach
transports the audiences from
a bathroom floor where cockroaches rule, to a hard-working, middle class couples
morning ritual. When the husband relates to a cockroach's
struggle, neither wife nor
family doctor can liberate him
- from his pact. He proves to
be the playwright’s personi" fied cockroach. in the cockroach kingdom, there are self
appointed officials, so called
’gurus' of science and politics, who fail to come up with
solutions to pressing problems. The king cockroach
declares, "In the whole of the
cockroach kingdom, there is
no cockroach that feeds
another, everyone strives for
their own daily bread." Sound
familiar? Have we become
like cockroaches?
