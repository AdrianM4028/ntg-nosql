theme-based show so that we
can provide a platform to all
kinds of artists. They all are
free to choose over what they
want to portray on the canvas," shares Prakash.
The exhibition, which began on September 26, will be
on till September 30. “We
got a great response. In fact,
I found it better than Delhi. I
felt that here, we have more culture of art," adds Prakash.
Amit Kaila, one of the participants from Jaipur, has ﬁve
paintings displayed at the
group show, “These are abstract works. The paintings are from my
energy and music series."

Anita Dinesh, Archana Singh, Bhawani Shankar Shanna,
Maheshwar Sinha, Meenakshi
Aggarwal, Shwet’Goel were
some of the participating artists.
