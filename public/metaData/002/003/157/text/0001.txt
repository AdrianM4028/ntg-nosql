t is indeed heartening to
see the plethora of cultural, literary and theatre
activities being held in
the Pink City. Well known
,
for its forts, havelis
bazaars, and in recent years for the
Literature Festival, Jaipur is fast
emerging as a leading theatre hub in
the country;
,
.. What is remarkable about it is
that not" only high quality theatrical t
productions are being staged in the
city but they are also receiving the
appreciation and applaud duly
deserve from art aficionados in the
Pink City.
The culture of ticketed plays is
fast picking pace in Jaipur: With the
business model based a not-for-profl
it motive and aiming to promote
maintaining decorum during a performance, tickets are priced at nom—
inal rates. This gives an opportunity
to the genuine theatre lovers to witness 'A' level theatre in the Pink City
without any intrusion from unsocial elements.
It is also worth pointing out the
diversity in the genres of the plays
being staged in Jaipur: From post
modern to historical and from
musical to solo performances, the
Jaipurites are exposed to a wide
range of plays.
In the past one year, Jaipur has,
seen some outstanding productions
being staged at various venues in
the city. The solo play 'Notes on Chai‘
devised, directed and performed by
Jyoti Dogra and staged at Jawahar
Kala Kendra was exciting experimental theatre. The use of tools like
verbal exchanges in everyday life

and abstract sounds in the form of
1८
Buddhist chants left the audience shocked and awed.
Another play that received
much applaud was 'Gauhar‘.
Directed by Lilette Dubey, the
play is based on Vikram
Sampath's book 'My name is
Gauhar Jaan'. The extraordinary
story of one of India‘s classical
superstars who was way ahead of
her times and whose personal life
was as mesmerizing as her profes»
sional career, and was beautifully
portrayed by Rajeshwari Sachdev,
She also sang some songs live on
stage that left viewers elated.

SAARC Sufi Festival held at Diggi
Palace last year also saw the staging
of the Urdu play Lal Qile Ka Aakhri
Mushaira. Starring Tom Alter as the
lead actor, the play was about a
soiree or a mushaira set against the
backdrop of bitter end days of
Mughal rule under the last emperor
Bahadur Shah Zafar in the 1850s.
just before the 1857 uprising.
Needless to say, ’I‘om Alter's histri—
