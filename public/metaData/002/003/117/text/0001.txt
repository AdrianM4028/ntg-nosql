Mahavidyalaya, Rao shares,
“Ashta Nayz'ka exists in
every woman not just in the

Natya Shastra. So I identify
so much with these

me choose this theme.
Vidyapati had written
poetry but has not

research included picking
up poetry that would cater

to a particular nayz’ka.”
After discussing the idea
with danseuse Shovana
Narayan, eight dancers
were chosen to perform as

different nayz’kas. Talking
about the selection of
dancers, Rao explains, “For
example a soft nayz’ka like
Virahotkanthita — one
distressed by separation, or

Proshitabhartruka — one
with a sojourning husband
is more suitable for
Mohiniattam,” she explains.
