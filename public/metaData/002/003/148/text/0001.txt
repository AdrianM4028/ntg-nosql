talks about the tale of women
and their celebration of masculinity; The Ramayana explores the human characters
of Rama and Sita; Wildtrack, a
story of magical companionship between a man and a
women that they must keep a
secret, and others.
In addition to all the drama,
there will also be workshops
and discussions, called Cyclorama, wherein one can interact
with theatre professionals, engaging in dialogues related
to contemporary theatre prac-

tices, among other things. Prior registration is required for
the sessions.
With such a varied display of

stories, Mody-Kotwal wishes

er talent was most ap-

Hpreciated last in the
wildly popular play,
Vagina Monologues, of which
was the producer and director.

But it was time actor Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal moved from
its intoxicating vehemence
and proved her acting might
again. She waited patiently for
an essay that would be thoughtprovoking enough to stimulate
her senses. Agnes of God
served that purpose for her. It
is a play that tells the story of
a nun who upon giving birth to
a child insists that it was the
result of an immaculate con—
ception. What follows is a tumultuous sequence of events
that bring about accusations,
investigation and a strong effort to protect Agnes, the pro-

tagonist, and the church from
a huge scandal. It really did
put Mody-Kotwal’s acting
prowess to test.

It comes as part of an assemblage of plays being staged
through the Old World Theatre
Festival banner. These have
been arranged discerningly so
as to show some of the most

pertinent works of the performing arts in the country today. ३
Besides Agnes of God, you
have Barff, a play wherein desperate parents of an ailing
child and an unsuspecting doctor are caught in the whirlwind
of conflicting questions of
truth, reality and belief; The
Gentlemen ’3 Club AKA Tape

she had enough time to catch at
least a few, but being preoccupied most of the time keeps her
away from doing other things.
Not that she is complaining.
“This is also the most happy
aspect of my life,” she says, believing that this phase is her
best so far. “I can totally be
myself without giving a rat’s
a*s about what people think of
me,” she says. With Agnes of
God, M o d y- K o t wa 1 has
completely immersed herself
in an intriguing debate between faith, religion and science. She waits to see what
transpires now.
