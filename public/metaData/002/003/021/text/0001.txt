1857: Tur'r'ebaz Khan written by Padma Shri Mohd. Ali Baig is

a gripping drama of an unsung hero from the Deccan, set
against the backdrop of the Sepoy Mutiny in the 19th century. His freedom struggle, revolt against dictatorial rulers and

his ultimate martyrdom is not just a snapshot of the coun,try’s independence movement, but a universal struggle
between the haves and have-nots.
