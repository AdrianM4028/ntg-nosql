ew Delhi: Morning is the
best time to listen to music,
but our. hectic schedule
makes it difficult to enjoy
the early morning hours. To
make people relish live
music, “Morning Ragas”, a
series introduced by
Legends of India in association with Sangeet Natak
Akademi, was organised in
the national capital on
Sunday. The concept of this
concert was designed for
two reasons: first, Sunday
mornings are for spending
more time in bed rather
attending a concert. Second,
this concept has been
designed to promote the
dedicated artist from
younger generation. These
concerts showcased the legends in the making. Present
among the audience were
Shinjini Kulkarni, Nirmalya
Dey, Navnita Chowdhury,
Ashish Ghosh. and
Siddhartha Banerjee among
others. Ustad Bahauddin
Dagar, who was also among
the audience said, “These
bait'haks help audience come
closer to the artistes and
understand music and the
musicians.” The programme
that was held at Meghdoot
Auditorium, Rabindra
Bhavan, rnesrnerised the
connoisseurs of lndian classical music. On this occasion
Shiraz Ali Khan chose to pay
tribute to his father
Dhyanesh Khan, grandfather
Ali Akbar Khan and great
grandfather Acharya Baba

Allauddin Khan. With young
talented artiste, many young
music lovers swayed their
heads and tapped their feet
while some sat still — heads
bowed and eyes shut — in
deep thought, as if deciphering what lies ahead as
the soulful melody of Raga
Nat Bhairav. The founder
chairman of Legends of
India and the curator of
"Morning Ragas”, Dipayan
Mazumdar said that “the
purpose of presenting these
soulful renditions were to
I bring the young generation
into the fold of classical
music and uphold our
cultural traditions”.
