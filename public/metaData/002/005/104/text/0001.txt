ET between 1884 and 1899, Abyakto
S (Unsaid) is directed by Sima Mukheriee
and centres around the life of Dr
Mahendralal Sarkar, a man who spoke his
mind and was steadfast in his ideals. The
play narrates the journey of Sarkar’s life and
his dream of forming a science association.
He was strongly in favour of the inclusion of
women in the medical profession, so that
they could take care of their illnesses. Things
did not go as per plans, which left him disappointed until a chance encounter with the great mystic, Ramakrishna Pararnhansa, led to a
transformation in him. Sending a message of optimism and the eternal hope of light at the end
of the tunnel, the play tries to chronicle this startling transformation in the life of a rationalist.
