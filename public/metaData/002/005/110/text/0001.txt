LOVE AND LONGING ON DELHI STAGE

Delhi’s Akshara Theatre will
stage I’m Your Venus, a play
based on David Ives’ theatrical
adaptation of Venus in Fur by
Leopold von Sacher—Masoch,
on May 28. Directed by Anasuya Vaidya, the play is a witty
adaptation of the famous 19th

century erotic classic.
Set in contemporary times,
it features a desperate actress

and a skeptical playwright, who
turns a stormy, late—evening

stage audition into a play within
a play—a cat and mouse game of
sexual power, with some unexpected divine intervention.
The play is set in two time
and geographical zones—contemporary New York and 19th
century Germany. It explores
the complexity and layers ofa
different kind of love, desire and
relationship. Its witty dialogues
and underlying philosophy
make it especially relevant in

today’s times. The characters are
performed by Nisa Shetty and
Rakesh Palisetty.
The 70-minute long English
play is suitable for viewers above
the age of 18.
Earlier, it was performed On
Broadway and was made into a
ﬁlm by French director
Louis M alle.
