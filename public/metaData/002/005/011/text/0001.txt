C

Come June, one destination
Will commandeer the art
lover’s interest. An ex-

hibition of the work
of the Indian - modern
painter, Bhupen Khakhar,

will Open at the Tate
Modern in London on Jime
1. The exhibition

is being supported by the
Delhi-based Kiran Nadar
MuseumofArt.
"
The art fraternity and any- '
one with an interest in India’s
modern and contemporary .
art movement is expected
to pay the exhibit a visit. It
brings tOgether Khakhar’s
work from across ﬁve decades
and collections around the
world for the first time since
theartist’s death in 2003. Itis a
unique opportunity to appreciate his extraordinary skill
and inspirationalstory, much
like the talked-about retrospective of V S Gaitonde’s
work at the Guggenheim.
