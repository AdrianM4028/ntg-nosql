Justice has its own logic.
So does injustice.
It is a logic that is based on

what are considered

to be fundamental and unalterable premises of human
behaviour :

Fundamental

because

Society

feels

insecure in questioning them and unalterable because
we have not had the courage to change them.
So deeply मृ has this logic been embedded in our
consciousness that even when it is used to perpetuate
a blatantly corrupt and unjust ५ system that makes a
mockery of finer human responses like fellow-feeling,

compassion and fOrgiveness, we find ourselves unable
to protest, unable even to react.

Such is the bewitchment of this logic of injustice.

We have to penetrate the veil, break this Spell, by
continuously and deeply questioning everything that

seems 'natural’ and ’common', all that appears to
conform to the ’Rule' in our day to day living.

We have to begin now,

lest

ordered

disorder

planned caprice and dehumanized humanity' becomes

a permanent, morbid reality.
