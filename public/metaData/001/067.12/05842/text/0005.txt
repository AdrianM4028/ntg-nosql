Stage craft has made great progress in India.
We have had some excellent new plays, and developed
new techniques. We have some ﬁne players. There has
been a general development of the theatre in India. This
has been mostly possible through the efforts of amateur
groups. They all need support and encouragement.

I send my goodwishes for the success of the
latest venture of the Jaja‘bar Gosthi
