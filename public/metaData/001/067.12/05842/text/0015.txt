The forces of life are stagnant in the present.

The precarious condition has

become unbearable. The age old faith, the truth, the feelings of security are fading
away. The World that we are facing is dreadful, meaningless and frustrated, the
destination unknown.

The belief, “Drama Mirrors life” is a thing of the past as the Drama is absent
from life.
To-day life is moving in same circle hence Drama in conventional style is not
feasible. In the sphere of art and culture, the Eternal Truth has become a mockery

as the ‘thinking’ of the artist reﬂects the thought of life.
In the execution of this drama therefore, apparent truth has not been cultivated
but inherent and phychological truth, the realisation of the sub-conscious self happen
to be very essence. This drama echoes the voice of the modern human being, tired
and f'ettered with doubts in the stormy sea of life searching for a refuge.

The main centrifugal character of this drama catapulting away from the routine
way of living, ridicules himself to be a worthless object of the Universe.

In the midst of this complete frustration creation or development of ﬁner feelings
and emotions is impossible in spite of best advocacy of the orthodox optimists.
picture of the present day Society and Country is darker than ever.
