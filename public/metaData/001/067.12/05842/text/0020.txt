I HOLD THE WORLD BUT AS THE WORLD
A STAGE, WHERE EVERY MAN MUST PLAY A PART

—-Merchant of Venice
Act 1, Scene 1.

The world is a stage and all of us are players.

Life will be bereft of pleasure and progress if we

do not play our part well.

You can play your part well, provided you are
free from fears and worries, and you have conﬁdence

in yourself.

What builds conﬁdence in you and keeps

you free from worries is a small, happy family. Practise

Family Planning.

Free services are available at every

Family Planning Centre.

Remember :

Red Symbol

is the sign of Family Planning Centres.

HAVE FEWER CHILDREN
WHEN YOU HAVE TWO,
THAT WILL DO
