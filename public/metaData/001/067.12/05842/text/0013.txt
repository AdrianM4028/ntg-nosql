presented on the stage. The fact that ‘S’ has succeded in portraying
the theme in correct perspective and with success only speaks of the
theaterical talents with which the team is endowed.

We are a young and rising group.

Our immediate desire is to

gradually increase our members so that our own team work and
team spirit will continue.
We are deeply beholden to Sri Ajoy Kumar Mukherji, Chief
Minister, West Bengal and Sri Satyajit Ray, the one and only Ray
in his sphere of work, for their kind words of encouragement which

Will be a continuous source of inspiration for our quest for better
drama.
We take this opportunity to convey our thanks to all those
who are present here today and hope that they will continue to give
us the same inspiration and support in all our futUre ventures as
they have extended it this time.
