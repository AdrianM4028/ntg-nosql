easy to handle, inexpensive. Dehydration

takes the water out, seals the freshness in.
In fact. dehydrated foods stay fresh whatever the season. They take so little space
that transportation is easy. And they need

no reérigeration, no special storage facilities.
Dehydration is HINDUSTAN LEVER's contribution to the national eﬁort to produce

more food and make the most of what is
available. The farmer will grow more now
that he can count on steady prices and ता।assured market. And less will be wasted,
because more will be processed and preserved. From all this will flow new products
and therefore new opportunities.
The housewife is already familiar with our
dehydrated vegetables. Plans are afoot
for offering her a greater range of such
foods. The day will break brighter tomorrow
...with a little less of care. a little more
of joy.
