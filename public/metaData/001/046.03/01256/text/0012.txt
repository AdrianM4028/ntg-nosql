About The Author
Dr. Vidyadhar Pundalik was very often seen at
music soirees, dance concerts, theater performances in Pune. Those who saw him enioying
these arts and met him away from his desk at
the Deccan College, would not have known of
the scholarly persuit of the man. He lived very
simply and appeared to conceal successfully the
astute scholar that he was. To his students he
was a teacher with deep insight in Sociology-his
chosen discipline.
Pundlik’s creative writing put him in the top
frontline of the short story writers of the fifteen
and the sixties in Marathi. He was not a prolific
play wright like some others of his generation.
But his two plays stand out as important

contribution to Marathi theatre. (hakra a one-act
play explored the ruthless unending cycle of
violence in Mahabharata. It became a full
fledged play at the request of some of his
admirers. As Mata Draupati it sought to give a

new dimension to the heroine of Mahabharata.
It k interesﬁng to note that Pundahk nnote
Charvak during and immediately after the black
months of Emergency some twenty years ago.
How can one miss the obvious relevance of
(harvak in present times. The rebel that we see
in (harvak, the man who has the courage and
conviction to disagree with ruthless maiority was
perhaps lurking in the author’s mind and could
come out only when he wrote the play.
