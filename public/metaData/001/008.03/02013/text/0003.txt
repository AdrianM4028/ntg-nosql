Felk-lore Composers Worksh
p Opens
A wefl known philosopher has trul
y said that folk-lore
deals with the metaphysicai beli
efs prevailing in a particu~
lar society just as

the Chemistry and other natu
ral sciences
deal with the truth of the physical
, world. The impact of a
tolk song

seen hundred times more
than that of a series
of lectures. because it touche
s the very heart of the listner
, very deeply and with a feat
herlike softness.
For examples, the hlehru Yuvak
Kendra of Dehra Du t
successfully applied the techniqu
e of folk~lore to eradicate

animal

killing on festivals. The same vill
agers who

had
enjoyed an Ema! killing on as a
pastime now sing happily

the songs which depict the feeiings
of an animal bein

g
tortured. Thus, these songs and
the folk-lore composers
have produced miraculous resu
lts in moulding the attitudes
and properties of originally rigid min
ded tribals. Historically
in fact, folk-iota has always played an
important role in the
education of rural communities. The
various folk-arts cons-

titute the most popular and widespre
ad media of communication En the country, the learning proc
ess having been
mainiy through the spoken word
transmitted from genera~
tion to generation. 80 we set out
on the painstaking task

of compiling a list of folk-lore composer
s all over India.
We collected 200 names and the
list is not complete.

And this is why a workshop of rib/m
t 45 folk-lore
composers of different areas is bein
g hefd for seven days
at Dehra Dun at Forest Research
institute, Dehra Dun.
The underlying goal of the workshop
is to bring about
fruitful interaction of ideas between
folk—tore a tists from
different parts of the country, whic
h it is hope 2‘ will lead
better to 0.10 rdination and more effec
tive techniques.
