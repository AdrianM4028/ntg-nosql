Years ago, Pandit Nehru inspired us at ONGC to systematically plan for the future.
As a result, each successive year has seen ३ ONGC reach new heights of performance
and growth.
In 1986-87, the production of crude oil increased to 27.86 million tonnes; and that of
gas to 1729 million cubic metres...
As many as 10 oil/gas strikes were made...
३ . The Company’s contribution to the national exchequer rose to Rs. 3139 crores...
अ
And planning has become a culture and a way ofwork at ONGC.
Because, for a rapidly deveIOping country like ours, one of the most important goals is
self-sufﬁciency in oil resources.
