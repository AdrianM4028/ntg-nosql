Daniel Llords, $01.0 MARIONETTIST

Daniel Llords is on an “around-the-worldvconcert-tour”!

This young American, sometimes called the “Segovia of the
puppet strings" or the “Marcel Marceau to the miniature

man,” has been in theatre or concert nearly all of his life.

He made his debut at the age of six playing a Mozart piano
concerto as guest soloist with a professional symphony, and

rushed headlong through "careers" as an actor in twenty-

three motion pictures, as a singer on transcontinental radio
and as a designer for leading theatrical and opera companies.
However, the seven hundred

marionettes he has single-

handedly made and which constitute the “full strength of the

company” of LLORDS’ “INTERNATiONAL” have come to
be his ﬁrst love and his most rewarding mode of artistic

expression.

Tonight Daniel Llords introduces concert puppetry, corn-

bining the best in theatre and concert into a new art form

labelled CONCERTHEATRE, as intimate as story telling,

as opulent as the New York stage, as electrifying
Continental ballet troupeHa long, iong way and a far

as a
cry

from the child's “Punch and Judy”!

Not only is Mr. Llords the sole designer of the marionettes.
