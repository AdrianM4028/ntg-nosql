FA U ST

A fantasy on Faust in two scenes to the ballet music from the opera by Charles Gounod.

l.

Faust meets the young and virtuous Marguerite at a fair. Alone in his cell,
he dreams of her, realizing that the great difference in ages makes this love
impossible. The Devil appears and, in return for Faust's immortal soul,
metamorphoses Faust into a young man.

2.

Faust is tempted by the apparitions of three of the most beautiful—-and wicked-women of time: Cleopatra and her retinue, Venus rising from the sea and
Salome dancing before the head of John the Baptist. Faust longs only for
Marguerite. The Devil, in fiery temper, condemns Faust to hell.
