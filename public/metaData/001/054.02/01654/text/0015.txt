The theme of the play is mere nothing
Ionesco’s plays are characterised generally by a dark pessimisim, relieved very occasionally
by isolated ﬂashes of optimism and hope. The chairs is a perfect example of this. It is an
interiorised play, undoubtedly a staggering confession of its author, The play takes place
in an undetermined space that excludes references. Its dramatis personae, without a
disrernable identity, takes the form of an arena, where violent antagonisms spring up,
confront each other and wither away.

The locale for the play is an island. The old man and woman ontologically cut off from
the world and seek salvation in the very act of communication with humanity. One knows
