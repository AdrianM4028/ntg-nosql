“REMARKS ON MY THEATRE . . .”
It seems to me that solitude and anguish especially characterise the fundamental conditions

cal context, identical in his essence. So if we can converse with Shakespeare, Moliére and
Sophocles, if we understand them, it is because they are in their essence profoundly like
ourselves. I ﬁnd that the humanity of universal man is not general and abstract, but real
and concrete ; and man ‘in general" is more real than man limited to his own period,
diminished. Several times I have said that it is in our fundamental solitude that we
rediscover ourselves and that the more I am alone, the more I am in communion with

others; whereas in organised society, which is an organisation of functions, man is merely
reduced to his function, which alienates him from the rest,

I would add that it is its ﬁctional power that gives a work of art its value, for it is above
all ﬁctional, a construction of the imagination ; of course one ﬁrst comes to grips with
everything in it that is topical, moral, ideological etc...but this is grasping the least
essential part of it. Is this imaginative structure, built, of course, with materials
drawn from reality, of no- real use ?

There are some who think so. But why should

literary construction be less acceptable than pietorial or musical form P Because it is not
so easy to use the latter for propaganda purposes : as soon as one makes propaganda of
them, on the one hand they change their nature, and on the Other they are too obviously
revealed as propaganda. In literature, ambiguity is easier.

And if some people do not like constructions of the imagination this does not alter the
fact that they exist ; they are created because they answer a profound spiritual need.
