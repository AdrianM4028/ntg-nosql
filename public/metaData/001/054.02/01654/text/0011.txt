The Knife that rapes and the word that kills
All the plays of Ionesco generally exploit the themes of death, sin and the absurdity of
life. His theatre could be termed as nihilistic since it does not carry any message for the
salvation of the world. He describes the world in all its absurdity, for him there is no
escape from it. In his ﬁrst play - the Bald Prima Donna, the language is ripped to shreds
and degenerates into a string of incoherent words.
In “The Lesson”, however, language has an ulterior motive ; it is an instrument of _opression and helps one to dominate one’s fellow beings. Such domination is almost always
accompanied by the total annihilatiOn of the personality of the individual so dominated.
What could be more surprising, then, that Ionesco should have chosen as characters, a
professor, whose profession is to teach, therefore to speak and to indoctrinate and a student
whose duty it is to listen and, thus to submit. It would, however, be superﬁcial to view

“The Lesson” as a parody on traditional teaching methods, or as a stray case of one individual dominating another or even a feudal society oppressing its members.
“Brainwashing” or intellectual rape which continues to be the favourite theme of Ionesco’s
plays, takes on the dimensions of vampirism in “The Lesson.” In the play, we witness not
only the meeting of the vampire and one of its victims, but also the victim’s total destruction which leaves her inert and drained of all vital substance.

This Dracula’s instrument

of power is language.

Since this attribute is the prerogative of all human beings, it is not surprising that Ionesco
should have been criticised by everyone. This however, does not prevent him from touching the wound of our society, a society that imposes the ideas of happiness on its individuals, in spite of themselves, in the name of an ideology.
