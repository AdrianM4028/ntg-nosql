KALMRIGAYA (THE cunseo HUNT)
In the olden days there were many herrnitages or ashrarnas in India. Rishi‘s or learned sages lived there. Little children used to take lessons from

the old sages, Rishikurnar (Sindhu) was one such child whose father, a sage, was old and blind. There was this little girl Leela who very often used
to come and play with Rishikurnar.
One day the blind sage asked Rishikurnar to fetch water from the nearby Saraju river to quench his thirst. Dark clouds gathered in the sky as stormy
wind blew, and occasional lightning seemed to add to the premonitidn of an evil happening. Rishikumar left for Saraju river, assuring his father, that
he would return very soon. On his way to the river, Rishikurnar was warned by the wood nymphs, who loved him so dearly, about the impending
storm and they asked him to return, but the young child was worried more about his father‘s thirst than his own safety, and he left for the river in a
haste. »
King Dasaratha, valiant king and an archerof repute was on a hunting spree with his band of kingsrnen on that very day. Chasing a young elephant
… which eluded him in the thick forest, he was standing behind a bush when the bubbling sounds of water suddenly reached his ears, which, the king
thought was being produced by the elephant while drinking water from the river. He shot an arrow aiming at the source of the sound, his target. The
target was shot, but the king was surprised and terribly shocked to ﬁnd that the groan reaching his ears were not of the elephant but of an innocent
_ young child! He took the body of the dying child in his arms and stealthily walked up to the cottage of the blind sage.
The whole ashrarna was waiting most anxiously for Rishikumar to return. Touching the feet of the old sage, the king, all repentant, spoke in a sad
and tearful voice, begging to be pardoned for the unthought of sad and cruel incident.
Shocked in grief, the blind old sage cursed the king.But after some monents softened down and pardoned the repentant king Dasaratha.
The life in the ashrarna went on, in its usual manner thereafter, but everyone felt the absence of that. innocent smile and nimble footsteps of ,
Rishikurnar and the loneliness of a blind old man missing his only son.
