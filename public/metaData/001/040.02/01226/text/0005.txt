INU feels privileged that the invitation extented to NSD was
accepted and an Intensive Teaching—cum-Production Workshop
was held for the first time in the University history. I would like to
thank the NSD Director, Ms. Kirti Iain for collaborating with us.

The workshop marks the begining of a creative relationship between
JNU and NSD, both institutions of some standing. I hope this will

mean a step forward in the ongoing theatre movement in the
country, which is attempting to answer through its medium many
of the deep questions facing our society. For our students the
workshop represents an opportunity to express these feelings and
emotions in the most creative and culturally enriching form". The
educational process ofJNU is known to extend beyond its classrooms.
Theatre is important. The workshop provided them with the many
tools of theatre by way of training in acting, stagecraft, costume,
music, lighting, makeup and set design. It is a result of that intensive
training for over two months that our students are going to stage a
play by Bartolt Brecht's Three Penny Opera in its Hindustani
adaptation. I wish all the participants of this play all success.
INU extends a special thanks to all the experts and faculty members
of NSD for coming to us and training our students and providing
the various material support needed for this production.
We also congratulate JNU Drama Club, its convenor Ms.

Vijayalakshrni Bajpai, NSD Camp Director for the Workshop, Shri
Suresh Sharma, and Workshop Convenor Shri Vijay Kumar ’Piyush’,
IPTA (INU) for conducting the Workshop.

My best wishes to all the participants as well as audience to enjoy
this production by the INU students.
