ABOUT THE PLAY
The ’Three Penny Opera’ (1928) is an adaptation of John Gay's
’The Beggar's Opera’ (1728), with music by Kurt Weill. The plot
of the adapted play is same as that of the original, although little
of the actual text remains in the late nineteenth centuary setting.
The play revolves around activities of a shrewed businessman,
Narahari Poddar. A businessman to the core, Peachum has no

qualms about using any method whatsoever as far as money
making is concerned and does not hesitate to sacrifice his own
daughter's happiness at the altar of wealth. A proprietor of
beggars, Narahari Poddar plans to arrest his son in-law,
Bhayanak the bandit. But the chief of police, Police Pati Pandey,
is an old army friend of Bhayanak and hesitates to arrest him.

However is betrayed by a prostitute and arrested at his favourite
brothel. Soon after, he escapes from jail with the help of Police
Pati Pandey's daughter, whom he has assured of his love.

Narhari makes a deal with Police Pati and assures him of his
share of the begger's business income and thus Police Pati
arrests Bhayanak once again at the same brothel and condemned
to death. At the last moment, a lawyer arrives with a pardon for

Bhayanak. The moral — the bourgeoies and the criminal are two
of a kind. The play also throws light on the criminals of the kind
of Bhayanak and "businessmen" of the kind of Narahari.
