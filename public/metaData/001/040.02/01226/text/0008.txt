A MESSAGE FROM IPTA (INU)
IPTA (JNU) thanks Ms. Kirti Jain, Director NSD, Ms. Anuradha

Kapoor and Mr. Pankaj Saxena Extension Department for agreeing
to hold the intensive teaching-cum-Production in INU. IPTA (INU)

also thanks Prof. Y.K. Alagh VC, INU without whose support and
encouragement it would not have been possible to conduct this
workshop.
[PTA (INU) was formed in July 1994, and from then on our constant

endeavour has been to build a theatre movement in the campus. It
was perhaps due to these humble efforts that IPTa (JNU) organised
two workshops which ended with two productions BICHOO and
JIS LAHORE NAHIN DEKHYA WOH JANMYA HI NAHIN. Both
the productions were in all aspects produced and directed by us
only. Mr. Vijay Kumar Piyush directed both these productions.
Apart from this IPTA (INU) also organised the closing ceremony of
the PAHCHAN NAZIR YATRA in JNU . All these efforts represented

the culmination of a whole team of theatre activists each contributing
with their individual skills and talents.
This workshop and stage production, aimed not only at imparting
skills to students in various aspects of theatre but also establishing
a living creative relationship between two great institutions i .e. INU
and NSD. We believe, this workshop is a first step towards such a

relationship. IPTA (JNU) hopes that we will continue to recieve the
overwhelming support from teachers, students and Karamcharis of
INU, whose dreams of establishing a vibrant theatre movement
goes beyond the campus walls will always inspire us.
