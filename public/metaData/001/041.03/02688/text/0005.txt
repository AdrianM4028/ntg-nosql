Message

The National School of Drama has been organizing its
annual theatre festival, the Bharat Rang Mahotsav, for
more than a decade now and I am happy to see the

continuation of that tradition into the 11th year in 2009.
By bringing together several national and international
groups in one place and by providing them with a platform
for interaction and performance, the Bharat Rang
Mahotsav has contributed greatly towards enriching the
already rich and varied cultural heritage of Delhi. For all
those interested in theatre, the School’s theatre Mahotsav
has developed into a very important event in the city’s
cultural calendar.

This year I am additionally pleased to know that the
Festival is being taken to Lucknow where even more
people will have the opportunity to share its repertoire.

I wish the National School of Drama all success for
the eleventh Bharat Rang Mahotsav and I am sure
audiences will appreciate the bouquet of plays that are
being presented.

[Ambika Soni]
