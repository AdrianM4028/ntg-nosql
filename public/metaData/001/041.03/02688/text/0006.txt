National School of Drama is organizing 11th Bharat
Rang Mahotsav from 7th to 19th January, 2009 at New
Delhi.
It gives me added pleasure to know that a
catalogue containing brief notes about the earlier
festivals and details about the groups and production
being featured in the Theatre Utsav is also being brought
out on this occasion.
Participation of different groups and productions
from various countries would, no doubt, make it a
memorable event, which would continue to inspire young
theatre artistes. I am sure that the Indian component
would be able to showcase their excellence.
Please accept my sincere and best wishes for the
success of Rang Mahotsav.
