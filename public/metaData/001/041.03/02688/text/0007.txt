I am glad to learn that the National School of Drama is
organizing the Bharat Rang Mahotsav from 7 - 19 January, 2009 as
the premier institution of India in the ﬁeld of Drama. NSD deserves
our compliments for organizing Asia’s largest theatre festival
featuring 64 major productions from the length and breadth of India,
as well as from SAARC countries and ﬁve other nations. It is indeed
a herculean task to organize such a major function at seven different
venues of Delhi and also in Lucknow.
Theatre lovers in India look forward to this major festival, year
after year.
