Gropu vis-a-vis individual and vice versa; one compli-

mentary to the other, both moving in a causal chain,both
coming at cross, both compramising with each otherMahakavi Kalidasa the master mind in Sanscrit poetry

and drama, charmed with sweet sentiments,becomes relevent in

the above context, revealed in the textual motifs of his
great Abhijnana Sakuntalam.

Dushyanta the here, while entering the forest for

MRIGAYA o} hunt,never realised that the word MRIGAYA has
wider connotation. The antelope which he chases foreshadows

in him faint musings of a romantic thought, which normally
one should cast off while one enters the precincts of a
hermitage. When the hunt kindles in him feelings of amour

and he initiates a steep further from his expected limit,

the interference of the group manifests itself in the form or
a disapproval; but never the less this proves to be futile.
He feels that he has no bounds while he dabbles in his own
fancies. Slowly he responds to the sentiments of the group;
but by then he is head and soul deep in his commitment:
Dushyanta like the great epic here Sri Rama assumes a

level of social consciousness,reacting to the attitude of the

multitude; but unlike Sri Rama, he hides behind a blissful
forgetfulness ascribed to providence, a dimension contrived
by the great author to make his protagonist far above any
possible blemish in his character. which might cast shadows

on the traditional Nayaka concept. In Sri Rama's instance there
is unstinted obseisance to public reprimand, that takes him
to the extent of being cruel to his life companion. The
franskness with which his actions

are accomplished gives

us no room to question his allegiance to popular sentiments.

The curse of Durvasas in Sakuntalam is brought to
