focus to unveil the wrath of the group against an act which

possibly hurts the lofty image of a ruler. But again the loss
of memory of the ruler, although

desired by the group,

cannot be made to last for long, because that would entail
serious damage to the observance of the righteousness of
their king;

and hence

the acceptance of Sakuntala by the

group. This is how the abhijnana (ring) discovered by a
member of the group becomes a Symbol of the acceptance of
the reality by the people.

The limit of one‘s own rights irrespective of whether

one is the ruler or the ruhed, has to be prescribed by some

super imposed sanction, lest the social equilibrium would be
disturbed. WhicheVer the age we belong to, the problem
repeats in dif erent contemporary dimensions.

Sakuntalam ends with a note of p optimism:- “May the king
exert himself for the good of his subjects"
"Prakriti hitaya parthiva ....... "

This means nothing other than the imperative need for

the diligent observance of duty and responsibility on the part

of every one, not to speak of the ruler alone.
