PAROBAS BY MONO] MITRA
SYNOPSIS
.... .. And almighty created a farce over the fate of Gajamadhob.
Ever
since Gajamadhob left his native place - "Kankrapota" - during
the second
world war to join

his duty at Calcutta, he had been a tenant in a flat in

Guluostagar Lane for a period of long thirty six years. But the course of
his fate had already been destined by then. He could not make a trip back
to 'Karrkrapota' to marry his beloved and remained in despair throughout
for not being able to establish a 'Home’.‘ He was very touchy and
emotional when he saw his tenancy terminated by a decree from a court
and a new tenant just arrived in his place.
Gajarnadhob desperately tried to stay back at Guluostagar Lane to
have a bit of hornliness that gradually appeared before him with the tender
touch of Mandira, the new tenant and left his apartment with a sigh but
much satisfied.
