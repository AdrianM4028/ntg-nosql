(The Horse)

by
Bimal Bandopadhyaya
Selenus - a handsome youngman left his village home in search of a career with
his favourite horse - Incitatus, and reached Rome. The glitter of the Roman splendours
was too much for him and it did not take him long to lose all that he had in a

its history mainly due to the tyranny of the whimsical Emperor Caligula. Caligula

Selenus‘ horse, won a fortune for him in a horse—race. As a reward the Emperor
appointed Incitatus, the horse, as the Consul and married it to a girl named Ameana
whom Selenus loved. But Lollia, who had a passion for Selenus, stood in the way
and arranged for a direct confrontation between Selenus and the Emperor.

alone. He had behind him, the oppressed masses of Rome - and that made all
