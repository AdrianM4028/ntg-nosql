appreciated these effort of ours.

Our other activities include R abindra

Jayanti celebrations and the Vijaya Sammelani which were lareg
attended compact function. We avail of this opportunity to express
our profound gratitude to all our well-wishers for the patronage
extended to us.

On December 23, 1973, we

had our Annual picnic at the

Sultanpur Bird Sanctury.
Almost everyone enjoyed the cheerful]
surroundings and beautiful rural backdrop. This happy event will
be
remembered for a long time to come.

This year, we have invited Calcutta’s GANDHA R to present
two of their famous dramas viz., Julius Hay’s—The"HERETE‘GHORA”

in Bengali and Chanakya Sen’s anti-play—“TARARA SHONE NA,”
under the cultural exchange programme of the Gosthi.

On the other

hand, the visiting group has also invited the Gosthi to hold a festival
of plays at the Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta during the ﬁrst week
of January, 1975.

We hope all our patrons will enjoy both the dramas being staged
by GANDHAR on the occasion of our Tenth Annual Day function
and we are grateful for their kind patronage during all these years
and are even more hopeful that they will continue to patronise
us in the years to come.

We are deeply indebted to
