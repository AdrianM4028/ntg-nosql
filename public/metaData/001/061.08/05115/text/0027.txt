DESTRUCTION UNLEASHED

Anger and Rage
The last, eighteenth day’s evening in Mahabharata’s epochal
war unveils the utter catastrophic nature of violence. Ashwatthama already incensed by YUdhisthira’s half truth-half lie
which leads to the violent death of his father Dronacharya, is
further provoked by Duryodhana’s killing by the Pandavas.
Ninety Nine of Gandhari’s hundred sons are killed in the war,
and in her angry grief after her eldest one’s death, she curses
Krishna for his perceived inability to side with her vanquished
sons, the Kauravas.
All that is humane within them is drained in the moment of grief and rage. Gandhari
blesses and steels Ashwatthama’s body with the power of her eyes, taking off her
blindfold for the first time after her marriage with Dhritarashtra, the blind Kaurava
king. Amidst the terror and violence unleashed by Ashwatthama, a whole civilisation is extinguished. All codes of ethics, morality, sagacity are irretrievably mutilated .

Written against the backdrop of India’s partition, the play is informed by the two
world wars and the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Through the play
we can see Bharati’s engagement with the heated debates on the legitimacy and
‘quantum’ of violence in war. All in the service of mutually destructive ideologies.
Thinkers all over the world have been similarly driven by the issues involving questions of truth and lies and the grey spaces between them.
