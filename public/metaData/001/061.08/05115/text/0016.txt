DHARAMVIR BHARATI

Of Humane Values
Dharamvir Bharati [1926- 1997] represents the second wave of modernizers in Hindi
literature. He set standards in whatever he wrote or did. Born and brought up in Allahabad, he was a brilliant student, earning his PhD and then teaching literature at

the university there.

His Kanupriya, Saat Geet Varsh and Thanda Loha offer a range of fine lyrical poetry.
In the cold war era, he stood out as a critic championing human values, individual

freedom and unshackled creativity. Sooraj lea Saatwaan Ghodaa is a major experiment in the art and craft of novel writing. His first novel Gunaahon lea Devtaa is an
all time best seller.
Band Galee ha Aakharee Makaan and other stories, reportage on the Bangladesh liberation war, translations of world poetry, and his literary journalistic performance
with Sangam, Nikash and finally the weekly Dharmayug‘ are fondly remembered by
a vast readership. Dharamvir Bharati was honoured with Padma Shree and many
major literary awards.

AndhaYug, in his own words, ‘represents the beginning of the tradition of verse plays’
in Hindi. First performed as a radio play in 1953, it has been widely acclaimed in all
its stage adaptations. According to Girish Karnad it is ‘one of the great Indian plays
of the last millennium’. Eminent and aspiring directors have come back to AndhaYug
again and again. Appreciated by connoissieurs, it is said that Jawaharlal Nehru was
hugely moved by Mr. Alkazi’s first production in 1963, also held at Kotla Ferozeshah.

AndhaYug has travelled across languages and regions and continents. In English there
are at least three translations, done by Paul Jacob, 'I‘ripurari Sharma and Alok Bhalla.
