DIRECTO' ’3 NOTE

The Saga of Light
BHANU BHARTI

ndha Yug is an acknowledged modern Indian classic. Classics, including
those by Shakespeare, are open to interpretations, in different times and
in different hands. Andha Yug has so far been interpreted as an anti-war
play by all our illustrious and aspiring directors. In my previous presentations too, the last one in Nepali in Kathmandu, I had treated it mainly as a
masterpiece crying out against wars.
But the play offers itself to delve deeper — into the causes or origins of wars, violence
and counter violence. We are in a phase of history where ideology, moral precepts,
religious injunctions and even messiahs seem to have ceased to be effective. Our
motivations are governed by lies and half-truths.
Half-truths, even more than blatant lies, destroy our innermost hurnaneness.

Ashwattharna in this play is an archetypal example of this. Y'udhisthira, the eldest
of the Pandavas and supposedly a repository of Dharrna, ambiguously mutters:
“Ashwatthama is dead. Either the man or the elephant.” Consequently Dronacharya
at once gives up arms and is butchered. The son, Ashwattharna, still alive, thereafter

recognizes no bounds.

It is no longer a question of “just war”, or even the revengeful “judiciousness” of
“an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”. The violence evinced in the gruesome murders of Dronacharya and Duryodhana (the eldest of the Kauravas) lead him into a
mindless orgy of counter violence.
