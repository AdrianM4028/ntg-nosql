Vidura recognises him and takes him to Gandhari. She condems him as a collaborator of Krishna and killer of his own
brothers. Yuyutsu is shattered. Wonders if he was right to
ally with the truth and honour which he thought belonged
with the Pandavas.

Yuyutsu tries to tend to the mute soldier, a man he had de—
capitated. The soldier recoils. Yuyutsu sees his tragedy as
the one who is now perceived to be a motherless murderer.
The target of universal hatred. A scenic change, Ashwatthama, Kripacharya and Kritavarma are debating their
future strategy. Ashwatthamais adamant. There is only one
way: The death of the Pandavas must be realised. Revenge
is the order of the day.

the Pandava's camp. Sanjaya recounts how he brutally
murders

Dhristhadyumna,

the

killer

of

his

father

Dronacharya, and Shikhandi. Vidura is disconsolate and
condemns the counter violence.

possible danger. Sanjaya through the miasma conjures
Ashwatthama for Gandhari.
