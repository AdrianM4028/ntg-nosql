The death of Duryodhana is conveyed
to her. She breaks down in grief and in
her rage curses Krishna. She tells the
Lord that he will lose all his dear ones
just like she has lost everyone close to
her. Also vows that Krishna will die at
the hand of an ordinary hunter, killed
like an animal. Krishna with all humility accepts the curse. Gandhari breaks
down and repents. Asks Krishna why
did he have to accept the curse.
Vyasa tries to prevent Ashwatthama
from firing the Brahmaastra, the ultimate weapon of destruction. Warns

him how the weapon will lead to the
worst cataclysm. Ashwatthama does

not heed to his word and fires the
weapon with the intent of it falling on
Uttara’s womb, Arjuna’s daughter-inlaw. Sanjaya regrets all that has happened and his powerless, ineffectual
role. He questions the blessing through
which he could see everything blessed
by a divine vision.
The chorus sings of the advent of
the AndhaYug in which Krishna says
that through each of the violent deaths
it is only he who dies.
