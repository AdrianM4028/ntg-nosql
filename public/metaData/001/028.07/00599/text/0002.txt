'Today too, we have all such people in our midst.
Shouldn‘t we laugh at them? Shouldn't we, like our ancestors,
spite the darker aspects and experience our life and times with

our fullest energy and enthusiams?

We know Shudraka had Shakara

_,pardoned precisely because of this comic vision of life. And
for all we know, Shaker a and his likes might again have come
Life is as simple as that,
back here in this our land.of rebirths.
isn't it?’
