Simil r doubts mystify th- event of yesterday in the
jungle as four characters present four different versions.

Janumeer, Wife of the Warrior, spirit of the Warrior(invoked

ﬁacet of the same event. With changing versions, the faces of
the cheract LS vlso keep changing. We are engulfed in an atmosphere

Monk suddenly discovers that life still flows on and so does the milk
of human kindness.
The Monk can no longer go on his journey to the
unknown since the complex face of truth, ever—present under millions
of masks, suddenly flashes upon him.
A little glow from this truth—
which is neither black nor whiteeis all that we have on our way to
an our way to salvation.
