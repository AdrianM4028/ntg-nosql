SYNOPsgg
The dilapidated EAIBIK DWAR today stands as a mockery of
the glory that the ancient city Ketupeeth once was.
The same
RAIBIK DWAR is now the refuge of tramps, dumping ground for
ignoble corpses and unclaimed babies.
A Buddhist Monk and a Woodcutter have taken shelter there
in a torrential rainy afternoon.
The day before, both of them
were summoned to a strange court proceeding.
The~experience of

the Court “as thoroughly shake“,th€ Monk; he *.nts to leave his
Monastery, shough the Woodcutter wants him to eta' back. During
this conversation, an old tramp buts in; he is a or-anent resident
of this haven, his preoccupation being m kin” of J
from the
hair of the Corpses buried in BAZBIFirWAR.

inquisitiveness and instigation none the honk an d the Woodeutter
slowly rovoa the strange iaccident' of feste jay.

The event is commanplace: one murder and a rape; the
troublespot; the adjoining jungle; the victim is ajFree Warrior,
the outraged is his wife and the villain of the pieceiﬁ the
most notoriusrnane of the country — manumeer. Yes, Janumeer is
a fearsome name that cowers naughty children to sleep; Janumeer
is someone for whom murder and rape are ornaments.

But what happened

so special in the jungle yesterday that has shattered the honest
Monk. Of course, Janumeer has been arrested by the Keepers of
Law; he has confessed his crimes in the Honourable Court.
Yet,

if the eventualities had ended taere,

the Play perhaps

would not have been written.
_
Actually, an event is iust a pebble that is swallowed
up in water the moment it drops.
But the multiple ripples

resulting all around are so different from each other. We renain‘
content with one frogmnerﬁ: of a truth — like one of the views
of a mountain peak seen from a distance.
But what about other
views of other persons of the same mountain peak seen from so

many other angles.

Who can deny truth to any of these?
