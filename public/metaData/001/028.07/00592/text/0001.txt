“Natyakarer Sandhane thati Charitra", is an adantation

of Luigi-Pirandello's ’Six Characters in Search of an Auﬁnnﬂ.
This play, one of the most complex and baﬂﬂing-and one of the
most theatrical' of modern classics, has a stirring dramatic
action closely woven with keen and almost erudite discussions
of art vis—arvis life. These two strands—the tragic tale of six
characters and the aesthetics of compatibility of life and art—
merge into a theme which is the core of the play
jThe play
‘\
begins with a professional theatre troupe rehearsing a new play.
Suddenly burst into the scene SiX characters-the Father, the

Mother,

the Son,

the Step Daughter,

a wan adolescent Boy and a

little delicate Girl still capable of playing ain a garden—each
of whom has his or her personal tragedy blending into a heart—
rending tale. These characters, as the title suggests, have came
with a strange request of being allowed to reenact a scene in
which, as they assert, their whole life has been crystallised.
Slowly and grippingly the drama of the six characters is unfolded
and the Director of the theatre company finally agrees to give
them a caznce to reenact their
rama,
The second act begins with the nreparation of th:
enactment of a scene between the Father and the Step Daug1ter in
~a shawl—repairing shOp, in rea ity a bawdy establishment fun by
Banwarilal. In the nrocess of this preparation and actual
reenactment of the lurid scene, the question keens emerging again
and again—thequestion wheﬁaer .rt can really comnrehend'life,
whether art in its endeavour: to encomcass life actually (oes
not make a parody of life° At the end of second acc, the Step
Daughter, on the verge of committing incest with the Faﬁrxg
becokns her Mother to shout and intervene as she did in reality.
The Mother—carried away by the power of truﬁi and.reality~

forgetting that this is just a reenactment, cries”No, my caughter,
my child! You brute, she is my daughter!" "Good exclaims tie.
