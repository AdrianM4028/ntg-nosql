ELHI theatre is a grand example of a dramatic irony.
Though all the signiﬁcant
plays of this country and some
of other countries are staged
here either by local groups or by
outstation troupes, Delhi cannot
boast of having a live theatre of
its own. With all its cultural
pretensions the city does not offer
a choice of more than one or
two plays a week and that too
in a climate in which culture feels
most comfortable.

roots in the city.

For obvious

historical reasons this cannot be
helped to a large extent, but the
situation is not as hopeless as it
may seem.

This languagelessness , I think,
is one of the fundamental causes

Delhi theatre in its sporadic
activity is extremely exciting.
Some of the best plays written in
Indian languages are staged here
ﬁrst and then are taken up by
other theatre centres in the country Thus Delhi has the unique
distinction of acting as a clearing
house for Indian plays. For more
often than not
a signiﬁcant
Indian play is staged here ﬁrst in
Hindi and then it is translated
into and staged in other languages
all over the country. Sometimes
it has also happened that a play
written in a regional language is
ﬁrst staged in Hindi in Delhi and
then in its original version later.
Some notable examples in this

of the theatre‘s inability to take

category are Badal Sircar’s Pagla

An extension of this irony is
that perhaps this is the only city
in the country, may be in the
world, where plays are staged in
more than a dozen languages but
which, culturally speaking, is a
languageless city.

Why can’t this sporadic activity sprout into a full-ﬂedged
theatre? There is no dearth of

talent. The reason is that a live
theatre is not economically feasible in Delhi. The question can
be asked whether serious theatre
anywhere in the world is economically viable. The answer is perhaps in the negative. For all over
the world theatre is highly subsidised either by the State or by

private foundations.
In Delhi to some extent Pun—
jabi theatre has become viable in
the last few years. It has become

so not primarily because of its
crude titillating contents but because it caters to a deﬁnite language community which alone can
sustain a theatre. But then this
sort of theatre should be viable

anywhere in the world and does
