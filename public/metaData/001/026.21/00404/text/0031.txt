like going back to r the days of old
Indian theatre. He recalled how
he joined the New Alfred Theatre,
owned by the late Sorabjee Ogra, in

young boys with beautiful voices
were recruited as “heroines”. His
ﬁrst role as a heroine was that of
“Najma” in a social play entitled
“Chalta Purza”. He had played
the role of famous Hindu goddesses
and

queens.
