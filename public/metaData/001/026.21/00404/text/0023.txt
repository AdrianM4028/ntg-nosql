unsatisfactory. In spite
ber of plays it produces in a year,
in spite of the great advantage
of having a theatre of its own,
it has failed to leave a mark on
Delhi theatre scene. The reasons

are not hard to ﬁnd. The plays
produced by it have been inconse-

quential and the productions mediocre.

The National School of Drama
and its repertory perhaps could
have ﬁled this void, for at least
it does not lack resources. This
it has ﬁled to do solely because
it never has any guiding impulse
towards this goal. It does not
even try to become a part of
the mainstream of the land.

Areal tragedy that has happened in the last few years is that
many signiﬁcant theatre groups
which since 1967 had been the

life blood of theatre in the city

or
have either become inactive

have lost their purpose of direction.

one feels a certain lack of vision
and clarity of purpose. I ﬁrmly
believe that if the energy and
talent in this area is properly

Some young boys and girls al-

harnessed it can prove to be the

ways forming new groups with a
lot of talent and enthusiasm strive
hard to make their mark. One
such group which should be mentioned is Non-group which recently organised a week-long festival

strongest foundation of theatre in

of six plays. Whether it was a signiﬁcant event in the city may be
debatable, for one may question
the choice of the plays, but a
more important question is whether they will survive the initial

ﬂush of energy.

For many a

time it has happened that for
the ﬁrst venture there is an abuu—
dance of enthusiasm, co-operation
and energy, but soon after things
begin to look different.
Another healthy and very encouraging sign in the theatre of
the city is the ever increasing interest shown by colleges in dramatic activities. There is a tre—
mendous quantitative increase in
college dramatics. But here too

the city.

I also believe that this

is possible provided the initiative
is taken by the University itself
and a concerted effort is made
to achieve a well—deﬁned goal.

Lastly, I want to say a few
words about a dismal aspect of
the Delhi theatre scene and that
is about the role of critics. What

I have to say may be true of
many other places but I am primarily talking about Delhi. A
few, very few, exceptions apart,
drama reviewers in Delhi are so

ill-informed and ill-equipped that
they fail to perform even one
basic function and that is to inform the reader intelligently about
the plays.
The responsibility
can be equally shared by editors

of newspapers for they really
don’t take enough interest in the
quality of the reviews which
appear in their columns.
