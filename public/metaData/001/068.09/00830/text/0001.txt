‘Many political theatres have been reduced
to barren intellectual gymnastics in empty

theatres in the cities. Many of us keep
complaining that there are no plays in this
country.

If we studied recent history we could ﬁnd so
many themes dear to the masses
(and did not wait for them to come
to our theatre, but took theatre

to them), we would have an

endless repertoire of plays
and packed houses.’
