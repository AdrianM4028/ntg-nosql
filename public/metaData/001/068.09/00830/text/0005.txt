In the early seventies, he began to write and direct plays for the
jatra, the traditional touring theatre in the round, popular in

West Bengal and the neighbouring states. In 19 71 Dutt moved
out of the Minerva Theatre and returned to the more chancy

existence of all such theatre groups in the country, performing in
rented theatres in one night stands, and touring the country.
With his new group, the People’s Little Theatre, which he led till

his death, he explored all the potentials of a revolutionary
theatre’, reading national and global history afresh; responding

to all the critical issues that surfaced in the social andpolitical
life of hispeople, from an urge to conscientize them; and

making experimental forays into different modes of theatre and
acting conventions.
