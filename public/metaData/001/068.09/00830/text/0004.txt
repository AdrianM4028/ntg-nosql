A Man of Theatre â€”
and his work
Utpal Dutt (1929-93), playwright, director; actor and
ideologue, covered in his lifetime a range of theatre that

encompasses, in a sense, the history of modern Indian
theatre. He began with Shakespeare, both in conventional
style and modern dress, toured the country with the
Kendals, carried on with Shaw and Odets in the English
language theatre, before coming to Bengali theatre. After
a short stint with the IPM, Dutt concentrated on his own

Little Theatre Group, with a series of adaptations/
translations in Bengalifrom Ibsen, Gorky and Simonov,
and revivals of Bengali classics. In 1959, the Little Theatre

Group made a triumphant entry into the traditional
citadel ofprofessional Bengali theatre, the Minerva
Iheatre, where L TG staged a series ofpolitical spectacles

till 1971, including landmarks like Angaar, Kallol, and
Manusher Adhikarey. Simultaneously Dutt was
performing streetplays and agitprop.
