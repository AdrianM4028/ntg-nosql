PLT : Into the Future
The People’s Little Theatre, without Dutt, who
had been the guiding spirit and Director of

the group, faces the difﬁcult challenge of
keeping up the production standards
identified with Dutt, considered as perhaps

the greatest producer’ in modern Indian
theatre, and breaking into new areas of
creativity. The group has decided to produce
at least two plays every year. One of these

will either be a revival of an earlier Dutt

production or a production of a yet
unproduced Dutt text on the lines on which
Dutt is likely to have worked with it. The
other will be a totally new play —- in every
sense of the term. In theprocess, PL ‘1' is

committed to working in different theatric
modes simultaneously, ewecially in all those
that Dutt himself explored -—- the proscenium
spectacle, the comic, thejatra, the streetplay,

the agitprop.
