A Midsummer Night’s
Dream
A Shakespearean comedy raises the loudest resounding laughter as
it goes along. Itfollow's its own rhythm, its own whims. It war/ales

with the dazzle ofitspresentation and revels in the absurd antics of
its clowns. Shakespeare knew for certain that the theatre was no
psychology lesson. He was naturally not concerned as to whether

one caught the inner meaning ofhisplay or not. All the debates and
all the particular views of individual scholars about the plays of
Shakespearefourhundredyears after they were written stemfrom
the mysteries that lie deep in the dramatic action that Shakespeare
conceived. It was part of Shakespeare’s intention to keep his
meaning hidden. It would befine ifsomeone sought the meaning.
It did not matter if one did not care for the meaning.
