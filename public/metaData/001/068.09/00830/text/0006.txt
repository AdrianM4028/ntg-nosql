His interest in cinema, a medium which he

approached initially as an actor (appearing in his

ﬁ'rstfilm role in Michael Madhusudan in 1950,
and winning the national awardfor the best actor

of the year in 1969, for his masterly performance in
IMrinal Sen ’s Bhuvan Shame), developed over the
years to the point where he emerged as a director in

his own right, pursuing the vision of ‘a heroic
cinema’ in films likejhor (1978) and Baishakhi

Megh (198081). Besides his plays, Dutt has left
behind a rich corpus of writing on theatre, cinema
andpolitics, a consistent rationalization of all his
work, involvements andpassions.
