A few wordS................... अ----..-.-------.----.--.--..--.-----.-.-...---.--MEI-IRAN is dedicated to the cause of renaissance and propagation of
Punjabi culture through theatre and presents its proud
production BEBE BANI VILAITI’.
lN BEBE BANI VILAITI actor-writer-director P. Gopal has tried
to depict day-to-day lite of a lady trarnrnelled by ties of tradition. He
weaves interesting and amusing events compelling the lady to succumb
' to the lures of elegant and. stylish living. She walks out of the Past and
steps into the ‘mod’ world with disastrous-though at times hilarious-

consequences.
Without expressing a word of gratitude to our advertisers, it would
be like taking an egg without salt. Only the active and enthusiastic
support extended by them render it economically viable proposition to
stage a show.
come alive.

But for their help, no show would see the stage lights
