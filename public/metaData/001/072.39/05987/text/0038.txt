participent of the play went throgh the dialogues, so long perfection was not attained
Another major concern of the participents and the director was not te slacken the

tampo of the play. In college plays little attention was given to these minutest

details. I personally feel that long pratice moulds an artist tune to her! his Charater.
It brings out the best talent in the artist.
The experience which I have gained from my two plays have created in me
an yearning for doing more, play and I would pursue it, so long I get the chance, as

a hobby, of eourse not as a career. I am fortunate that my parents are not oppossed
[O my views but sometimes they oppose the daily practich business for they think it
would hamper my studie. It does, but I have managed with both my student life and
my acting life. After all, acting is an art, wholesome and healthy which develop the

potentialities of a person. But it ‘is unfor tunate that this art has not yet got the
recognition of the Patna-ites.

I am greatful you my parents and “Kala Sangam" for giving me opprtunity
to develop my potentialities in this ﬁeld. I have ful regards and appreciation for the
magniﬁcent work done by “Kala Sangam” in the realm of drama and upgrading it
to a recognisable heights. It has retained from making drama a commerci
al art.
Commeroialistation can lead to deteriotion of art.

I end with the conﬁdenc that very soon with the co—operation and efforts of
the people of the capital, drama would occupy a top position in the rich cultural
heritage of patna. And the increasing number of plays being put up by the various
dramatic institution of Patna. In the last Two years is a good omen.
