contact with theatre had kept me wondering and in fact, this very silence on the part
of Bihar has in a way brought me here. But after coming and having seen the efforts

made by Kala Sangam my illusion has disappeared to a great extent. Bihar is with
us in our theatre movement. It is really a very difﬁcult work to be able to form such
a large association of intellectual artists.”

Kala Sangam once again staged Laharon Ke'pRajhans on the 3 1 st of Marh ’78 on

the occasion of World Theatre Day. For this show, the then Governor of Bihar —Mr.
Jagganath Kaushal was invited as the chief guest; The Governor was also presented with
a donation of Rs. 1001- from Kala Sangam for the help of the Andhra Cyclone victims.

The last drama-festival was almost like a rest camp. Kala Sangam’
s presentation
of Madhu Rai’s ‘Kishi Ek Phool Ka Nam Lo' became a new attr
action for the lovers
of theatre. Based on Crime-Psychology this play helped us
in getting closer to almost

every class of the Viewers. In '78 July and August ﬁve (2
9th and 30th July, 5th, 10th and
13th August) shows were held. As the cast of the play
Surnan Kumar, Basant Kumar,
Shekhar, Satish Anand and Vandana Sharma were acclaime
d for their successfull performances. Rashami Sinha was appreciated and ta
lked about for being the new discovery as well as f'or her realistic portrayal of h
er role. Bapi Acharya’s musical composition and Ashok Srivastva's light arrangements gave a
new and delightful experience

to the audience.
