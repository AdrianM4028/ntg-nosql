Thus thef‘ounding of the “University Cultural Association" in 1967, by ‘Rev.
Father Hass, a Jesuit priest, Prashant Sinha,

Mrs Annie

Mukhopadhaya, late Mr.

Popal Bhattacharya, Sister Peter Claver of Notre Dame High School, and others, was
an important step in encouraging the evolution of theatre consciousness in Patna. One

wing of this Association was in charge of organising and staging plays, and as the
majority of the members were English-speaking, the plays staged were mainly in English.

Some of the members of this wing, however, broke away to form “The Patna
One-Act Play Festival Cultural Society", in 1967, under Father Hass.

This society

organised play competitions annually and although to begin with, the entries were few,
the regularity of these annual competitions and the persistent efforts of the society
members, specially that of Mrs. Annie Mukhopadhaya, encourgged more groups to par-

ticipate in the festivals. These competitions also compelled the participants to ' improve
their standard in acting and direction. As they came mainly from the English-speaking

groups, the number of English plays staged were found to be more than the number of
plays staged in the regional languages.

These annual competitions gave the young artists the chance to develop and show

their histrionic talents and since then, a number of good and some {outstanding performances of English plays by groups like the University Cultural Association, The
Toupers, The playdoers and the
audience.
