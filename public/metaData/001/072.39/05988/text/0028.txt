In 1977, on September 10th, 11th, 17th, 18th and 25th Kala Sangam staged the

famous comedy of Badal Sarkar—“Ballavpur Ki Rup Katha.” It was directed by
Satish Anand. Maya Sinha (as Swapna) proved by her excellent performance that
Kala Sangam had once again discovered a talented

and promising artist. Though the

theme of the play was criticised, the public was well entertained. In fact, they clamoured
for more shows.

As the other characters of the play Sarita Sinha (Chhanda), SumanKumar

(Bhupti),ParwezAkhatar(Sanjeev),Satish Anand (Haldar), Harisharan (Manohar),

Pradeethosh(Pavan), Jamrnu (Sahu), Kiran (Chaudhari) and Sudhir (Shrinath)
were there.

On the 18th October and the 29th of December ’77, Kala Sangam presented
Shushil Kumar “Singhasan Khali Hai”. This play with its sharp rareastic dialogues
depicted those politial leaders, who are always power-hungry.

The direction was once

again by Satish Anand, who had then very successfully inroduced some well-suited
techniques of presentation. Right from the beginining the audience got totally involved

with the play because the characters came out of the viewers, this involvement
conti, nued up to the end when the Sutradhar got down (the stage) and
started looking for a
capable candidate for the throne.
The cast consisted of Sutradhar (Suman Ku
mar), Netaji (Satish Anand), Purush
(Parvez Akhatar), Stri (Shruti Shukla), ﬁrst
person ( Jammu), second person (Vineet)

and third person (Harisharan).
The public had fully enjoyed this p
olitical satire.

On

the other hand he has also been suc
cessful in creating a culturally
and aesthetically
conscrous audience. Their
number seems to be increa
s ing with every new resentation
by Kala Sangam.
