The close of the year saw the compeletion and successful presentation Of Dr.

Dharamvir Bharati’s ‘Andha Yug ’ The director’s hard work, training 0f raw amStS,
painstaking attention to each detail of light, sound and movement, went tOWards
achieving such an effective impression that each scene seemed a painting poetically
framed.

Vijay Tendulkar’s ‘Khamosh, Adalat Jari Hai !’ was staged in 1974 and once
again it was the histrionic abilities of Vinita Agrawal that came as a highlight of the
play. Others, who were also good in their roles were Navneet Sharma, Satish Anand,

Kumkum Rastogi, Shailendra .lha and Uma Shanker etc. As for Satish Anand’s directoial talent, he proved himself a master of his subject by the intelligent use of
his character, by swiftness of the movements employed, and the clear and effective us
e of the
freezing technique.

This technique was being used in Patna for the ﬁrst time.
It was a proud day indeed for Kala Sangam wh
en Mr. Tendulkar himself
witnessed a casual presntation of ‘Khamosh, Adalal Ja
ri Hai !' The late Phanishwar

.Nath ‘Renu’ and Prof.

Nilaiuana Agrawal were also present.

Mr. Tendulkar was

greatly appreciative, and he said “Yo
ur swift movements seem entirely a
new innovation to me. Had I had those movem
ents in mind while writing the play
perhaps the
play could have been still better written. I ca
n well imaging how well you must have
done it in one of your ﬁnal presentation.”

In the last week of April ’75. Kal

Sircar. In this play it was yet anothe
