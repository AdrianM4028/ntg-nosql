In 1972 “Bidrohi” organised for the ﬁrst time All India Bengali One Act
Play Competition and have made it another interesting annuat feature held during
the earlier month of spring. Currently several different dramatic groups have been

operating & Dhumketu, Aparichito. A ebong B, P. T. U. etc. are only a few of the
names. The Bihar Art theatre has also contibuted its share of Bengali Plays under the
able guidance of three Anil Mukhopadhyay.

The brief history of Bengali Dramatics in Patna has been compiled mostly by
the help of play actors and the auther is especially grateful to Shree Anil M ukhopadhyay

for his help in this matter. Some names may have been missed out rand there are so
many in this ﬁeld now) the author apologises for any such chance omission. However

amongst the theatre loving and theatre going Janta in Patna, two names remain ever
outstanding for their direct and even indirect participation and contribution They are
Phaniswar Nath Renu and Nagarjun.

To add a last word, it is regretted that quite a number of problem
arise here
in producing plays in Bengali. The just and f'ormost is the necessity of
theatre worthy
stages and auditoriums, Raviadra Bhawan and Nritya Kala
Mandir though quite fulfilling all the necessary requirements :are still much too expensiv
e. Another major
crisis which all the theatrical groups havc got to face is the prob
lem of financial efﬁciancy. The Govt. should allow grants to the arnatear
theatre groups, so that the
devoti on and love of the theatrical people may at last th
rive and so that the cause for
which so many people work together may not fade;

away into an inglorious end. And

lastly, of course, the other common problem to face
is the non availability of ladies
.
to enact the f. emale roles for this the social set up is of c
ourse one of the factors but
the fact remains that more interest is necessa
ry in the theatrical movemont which is
one of the vital expressions of a social set up.
