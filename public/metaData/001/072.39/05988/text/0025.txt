The inﬂux of new ideas and the news of an undeviable theatrical

awakening

from different parts of the country led to the fornentation of the deep inner urges of
artistic aspirations in the citizens of Patna.

The sensit
Satish Anand in the four-faceted lead role became the talk of the town.

With her can-

did appearance on stage, Vineeta AgJawal not only proved herself as an invaluable ﬁnd
by Kala Sangam, but appeared as a spark of deﬁance of the taboos set by the conserva-

tive society of Patna.
The other

artists to note were Veena Sahai, Vandana Gupta and Suman

Kam ar .

Kala Sangam had the good fortunate of having Dr. Lakshmi Narayan Lal at one

of its meetings wherein his play ‘Abdulla Diwana’ was read.

Some scenes from ‘Andha yug’ which was then underway was witnessed by Dr.
La], during the rehearsals.

Kala Sangam stands indebted guidance.
