came out of the prison of a theatre and started a positive movement. With the help
of this we were not facing the public but were able to walk with them. This movement
was ‘Juloos’ a hindi translation of Badal Sarkar's Bengali play ‘Michhil’ ‘Juloos’ was
performed in different parts of the town in the

lawns under the guidance of Satish

Anand. In Patna this sort of effort was made for the ﬁrst time. The ﬁrst set of presentations started f'orm 30th September 78 and up to now 28 performances have been
conducted.

The aim of theatre should always be to make the audience aware of the realities
of life in context with the new situations, but this has to be achieved with an eye an the
particular demands of the time. Thus, while carrying out our humble plans with this
aim in our mind we got the opportunity to meet about

50 thousand people. Juloos’

‘Singhasan Khali Hai was once again staged

on 9th October '78.

had been organising many meetings for discuSsion on
various subjects. These meetings have been our another achievement. In one of such getIn the meantime we

togethers we had the privilege of having with us a well-known writer of Hindi who
belongs to Mauritius—(Mr. Abhimanyu Anant.

During the course of long theatre‘journey we had to face quite a few perils.

Financial problems many a times pushed us almost to the point of breaking up and
drifting apart, but on all such occasions it was only our dedication' to stage and our

invincible faith that kept us ﬁrm.
This drama—festival which has been organised by Kala Sangam will

make us

realise how much we have achieved after all the struggle that we went through. It is a
landmark because this time we have been able to invite to this poor but originative land

of Bihar the artists from the National School of Drama. The ﬁnancial short comings
make Kala Sangam helpless in many way but we are sure that this humble effort made

by the groups will surely prove to a helping hand in creating an encouraging atmosphare for the theatre artists of Bihar.
