The inﬂux of. ,new ideas and the news of an undeviabl'e theatrical awakening

from different parts of the country led to the ﬁrnentation of the

deep

irirter

urges of artistic aspirations in १ the Cll'Zt’iS of Patna. This urge could no longer

be denied. Consequentlyit led to the formation of KALA SANGAM.
As its initial productions, Kala Sangam chose

to

present

‘Rishte‘ Ki

Zaroorat’ and Prayashchit in {966. Next came, Ram Mehta’s ‘Paisa Bolta Hai’

under the direction oflate GopalPrasad. This was followed by another play by

Ramesh Melita, ‘Dievar-Bhabhi’ but this was directed by Bhagwan Prasad.

we had the presence of Mr. Nemi Chandra Jain during the shows.

Kala Sangam ushered in 1970 with the presentation of‘ ‘Adhe Adhure’
by Mohan Rakesh with the added gift of Satish ~Anand as director.

SatishAnand’s next directorial effort was ‘Marjeeva’ in 1972, which also
met with success. However,

it

was'Adhe Adhure, re-staged the next year

that

proved a colossal bins-weeping the» whole of Patna with its success.
The sensitive portrayal of Savitri by Vineeta Agrawal and
Satish Anand

the Versatile

her candid appearance'on stage, Vineeta Agrawal not only proved herself as an
invaluable

ﬁnd by K’ala'Sang’am, but appeared as

a

spark of deﬁance of the

taboos set by the conservative society of Patna.

The other artistes to no e were Veena Sahai, Vandana Gupta and Suman

Kala Sangain had the good f’Ortune of. having Dr. Lakshmi Narayan Lal at
one of its meetings wherein his play ‘Abdulla Diwana' was read.
