Apart from Kala

Kumar (as Babuji) ठेठ Suman Kumar(as Shyam')newcomers Amita Mehrotra (as Amma)
and Savita Sinha (as Rama) took their bow before the audience, Shurti Shukla staged
a comeback after a gap of several years. For Rajkumar Mehrotra, it was a brilliant
debit.

This play was dedicated to the memory of Late Phanishwar Nath Renu.
To sum up the role that Kala Sangam has acquired in the world of Theatre

to-day, it would sufﬁce to say that just as the importance of this great movement
towards the cognition of this particular form of act can never be over estimated, so

also the conception of Kala Sangam as the impetus towards that COgnition cannot

be denied. In this perspective Kala Sangam emerges as a Pioneer in this ﬁeld.
The success that Kala Sangam has come by, the recognition that it has

gained and the seats-of respectability that it has acquired has by no means been

easy to come by.

Of course, some of these difﬁculties its way behind Kala Sangam now it,
has found its rightful place. Apart from the problem of the scarcity of female artistes,
we are confronted with a giant stumbling block in the shape of ﬁnancial limitation.

The diﬂiculties faced by it were the difﬁculties confronted by pioneers
in
any ﬁeld, in the history of any land at any time the novelty of the terrai
n large tracts
of inhospitable country the friction with the orthodox conservatism
of society.
