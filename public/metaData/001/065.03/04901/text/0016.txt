“Anamika” ' a dramatic group from Calcutta won the ﬁrst prize for Hindi plays in the All-India
Drama Competition held at Delhi by the Sangit Natak Akademi.

The effort is commendable for the simple reason that ladies who normally would have
remained in digniﬁed purdah have discarded social restrictions and appeared on the stage to
give fuller scope to their latent talents. There are four women characters in Naye Haath
and all were played excellently.

“Janata Ka Shatru” ( The Enemy of the People ) was another Hindi play staged by Anamika
in Calcutta as their annual offering. This was a Hindi adaptation of Ibsen’s play and so well
did it ﬁt into the background of Calcutta that it did not strike one as an adaptation at all.
The production was slick and the team worked as one man to make the play a success.
The literary and musical activities of Anamika cover a wide ﬁeld and they are contributing in
a large measure to the cultural life of Calcutta.
