he has recently found a woman he feels he can love, and who loves
him ; he cannot take another life into his hands hounded as he is
by self-doubt. He is faced, in short, with what Eve brought to Adam——
the terrifying fact of choice. And to choose, one must know oneself,
but no man knows himself who cannot face the murder in him, the sly and

everlasting complicity with the forces of destruction. The apple
cannot be stuck back on the Tree of Knowledge ; once we begin to see,
we are doomed and challenged to seek the strength to see more, not
less.

This play, then, is a trial ; the trial of a man by his own conscience,
his own values, his own deeds. The “Listener”, who to some will be a

psychoanalyst, to others God, is Quentin himself turned at the edge
of the abyss to look at his experience, his nature and his time in
order to bring to light, to seize and—innocent no more—to forever guard
against his own complicity with Cain, and the world’s.
But a work of ﬁction, like an accident witnessed in the street, inevitably

gives rise to many differing accounts. Some will call it a play “about”
Puritanism, or “about incest, or “about” the transformation of guilt
into responsibility, or whatever. For me it is as much a fact in itself as a

new bridge. And in saying this I only dare to express what so many
American writers are trying to bring to pass—the day when
our novels, plays, pictures and poems will indeed enter into the business
of the day, the mindless ﬂight from our own actual experience, a

flight which empties out the soul.
