“Great men and eminent
men have monuments in
bronze and marble set up
for them, but this man
of divineﬁre managed in
his lifetime to become
enshrined in millions and
millions of hearts so that all
of us became somewhat of
the stuﬂ' that he was made
of, though to an inﬁnitely
lesser degree.”
—- Jawaharlal Nehru
