choosy about the scripts. There were not many scripts available which
could mirror the social realities. We colloborated with some writers requested them to write and invited scripts from new writers and formed the group
i. e. assembly of artists for social awakening and gave it the name VlPLAV.

by

VlPLAV is proud to have introduced new playwrights to Hindi stage
staging their maiden plays like Ramesh Upadyay's ’Paper weight',

Swyam Prakash's ’Ghar Oaid', RadheyShyam’s and Om Prakash Gupta's
’Afeem-Ke-Phool' and ’President Ayodhya Prasad' respectively.
R. S. Nishesh for the last so many years taken to himself to write for

Viplav and his plays like ’Adam Khor', ’Cuckoo Darling', ’Dooba Vansh Kabir
Ka' were successfuly staged by the group.
Few of our old friends left us, many new have joined. The VlPLAV
continues to adhere to its motto of presenting meaningful plays and is
contributing its meager efforts in the cause of social awakening for the
good of maximum number.

CHEEL GHAR is another new Hindi play of Nishesh in the same
gener. We trust it would entertain you, provoke you and you may always

like to witness VlPLAV’S plays.
