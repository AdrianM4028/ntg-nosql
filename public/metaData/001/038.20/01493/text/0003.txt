Rang - Vasundhara
Rang - Vasundhara, a theatre group has been formed in the capital by young and
enthusiasts workers, closely associated with the theatre movement. One of our aim
is to present good and meaningful theatre that relates directly to the socioeconomic
and political environment of our times. We have taken a step ahead to adapt and
imbibe the traditional and folk forms of our country into our modern theatre to give
it new meaning. The group has performed two Hindi plays last year with much
success.

i)

Shant Sagar mein EK roz - It is an original Hindi play, written by Rameshwar
Prem, a well-known play-wright and a contemporary poet.

ii)

Mahanirvana - the play is originally written in Marathi by Satish Alekar and
translated into Hindi by Dr. Vasant Dev.

This time we are presenting the stage version of Rashomon, a well-known Japanese
film by Akiro—Kurosawa. In this play we have, tried to interweave elements of
‘CHHAU’, a martial art of Orissa into the theatrical representation to give new
dimensions to both the forms.
We are also planning to produce a musical drama and a theatre festival this year.
