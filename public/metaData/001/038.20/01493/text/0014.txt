NFL Reiterates its pledge to the Nation
NFL, one of the leading producers of nitrogenos fertilizers in the country, has
established a trail—blazing track record, by virtue of its four plants - at Nangal,
Bathinda, Panipat & Vijaipur — performing much above their capacities.
Kisan Khad and Kisan Urea ~ NFL’s products - are very rich in Nitrogen, the

primary nutrient for plant growth. These fertilizers are easily available to farmers
through dealers, cooperatives and agro industries.

Through its countrywide network, NFL educates farmers on the efficient use of
fertilizers and provides a package of technological inputs to optimize production.
In its progress towards excellence, NFL has also optimized energy consumption
through proper monitoring and control, besides implementing pollution control

measures.
Continuing its march, NFL has identified ambitious expansion schemes in all its

plants which will keep NFL in the forefront of the Indian Fertilizer Industry.
NFL: Harbinger of agricultural prosperity.
