Director’s Note
‘Rashomon’ is the stage version of Kurusawa’s great master piece; a film in Japanese.
The play deals with the philosophy of human life and its different shades, through an
incidence of a rape and a murder. But is that a rape or a willful act? A murder or an
accident ? A suicide? All the incidents are swing through a total confusion, i.e. the
confusion of life. Shall one believe on one’s own eyes or on the stories of truth,
narrated by others? Which is the real one?
In this play one incident is been narrated in four different ways. How can one incident
. have four different ways of saying.
Everybody has their own way of interpreting the truth. Thus truth varies. If truth is
shapeless and baseless, why should one take so much of pain to dig out the real one?
That is why the wig-maker says - “For me truth is like a glow-worm, that glitters here,
there and ultimately fades out. Then why should I poke my nose to chase after the
mirage of truth, which is no where. The life is thereto be lived. Now I live, that is the
real truth for me.”
I never tried to go after the truth through the stories en-acted in this play. I have

emphasised on the relationship of man to man, of woman to man and the changing
faces of humanity in different situations. Through my characters, I have tried to bring
forth the agony, passion, violence, and tragedy of mankind. I have deliberately
highlighted them to review our own inner-self. How much anguish, violent and painful
they are... JUST THINK...
