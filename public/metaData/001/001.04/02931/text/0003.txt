Mq persona: views on “Yu nevi आशा।। Bhuleshu”
Goddess Durga comes down to the earth in whatever soul in whatever form to wipe out injustice, oppress-

ion and sin when the same exceed their limits. In this
independent society one must struggle when his dues are

snatched away from him forcibly. It is not ofcourse
something new now a days. All have become selfish- They
have lost their humanity for this self interest. No one

has time to think of the crucial condition of the stage on
which they are performing their roles. Many a Anantgopals
have dominated on this stage. There is no provision of
reservation on this stage for the low class and down trodden people like Murali and Rajen. When injustice and
oppression become

intolerable what would they do ‘.

revolution, killings on the leadership of people such as
Baisnava Jena and Durga. Thus eradicating all the sins,

injustices and oppressions.

Are these all fair that are happening on the back
of the undefiled area of our Mother India ‘2
