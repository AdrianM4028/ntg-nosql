Efforts of ‘Chayanika have really been appreciable for their annual production of plays in
memory ofNatasurya Phani Sarma. Their journey began with the production of‘Gornadhar
Konwar’ in which Bishnu Kharghoria, was in the lead role. In the subsequent years

‘Chayanika’ has organized all Assam level drama festivals making it possible for the audience
of Dibrugarh to enjoy plays performed by many renowned troupes.
The very soul of drama is still alive in Dibrugarh perhaps because of the mutual
understanding and co-operation among the different groups and workers in the field.
Under the inﬂuence and tutelage of these established dramatic groups , many other such
organisations have been making their entries in the world of art-for whom art is not for the

sake of art alone-but an artifact to create a life’s sculpture. Some such organisations are‘Sadarang Kala Mandir’, ‘Surya Shikha Moina Parijat’, ‘Dishari’, ‘Sapatak’, ‘Purbasa’, ‘Moitri’
etc. They seem to be preparing themselves to sing the triumphant song of life distancing the
study of culture from the narrow community of language and religion. I do not know
whether it is possible to sing the song of life in today’s Assam which is fast turning into a
graveyard. However, the voice of the singers is not stilled.
