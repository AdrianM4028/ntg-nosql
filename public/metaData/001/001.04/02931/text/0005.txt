M ESS AGE

I am glad to know that C'hayanika, a leading Cultural Organisation
of Dibrugarh is holding its annual Drama Festival front 31st July,
to 2nd August,

1997

1997 to commemorate the 27th Death Anniversary of the

great artist of Assam Late Natasurya Phani Sharma. Art and culture
have been a moving force for human society since primitive times and
are outward expressions of the emotions and motives that govern our lives.

Despite

tremendous changes

taking place around us, art and culture

should not be allowed to lose their relevance as they provide stability and
continuity within a society on which only the society can develop further.
Chayanika’s eﬂorts to preserve and emulate the path shown by

an

artist of the calibre of Natasurya Phani Sharma is to be lauded. His
single minded devotion from a very young age to a form of art he
believed in should be an inspiration to us all.
In their eﬂorts, I wish the organisers a grand success.
