It’s a rare privilage to have with us, as our ﬁrst guest director, Amal Allana from Bombay.
We are grateful to her and her husband, Nissar who made it possible.

Theatre is like sex.

One starts doing it and then one gets interested in getting better at it.

This has always been the case with Ruchika.

We are not interested in knowing what we already

know we want to know what we are capable of learning and in theatre an experince with the
Allanas is deﬁnitely an extra ordinary one.

As theatre workers the Allanas need no introduction.

Nissar is a well known designer Shri

Amal a National school of Drama graduate has spent two years in East Barlin studying theatre
later they founded‘ the workshop’ in Bombay.

Besides their productions in Bombay, Arnal has

directed several plays in Chandigarh for the department of Indian theatre folk theatre workshop
this year She is the recipient of the Homi Bhabha fellow ship for 2 years.

Edward Bond’s Saved for Ruchika is Arnals 15th production and we owe her much and

special Thanx.
