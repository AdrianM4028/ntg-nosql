WHO

IS

DESABLED?

Is yOu fail to see
the person
but only the disability
then who is blind?

If you cannot hear
your brothers
cry for justice,
who is deaf?

If you do not communicate with
your sister
but seperate her from you,
who is disabled?

Your attitude towards
persons with disability
may be our biggest handicap
& yours too.
