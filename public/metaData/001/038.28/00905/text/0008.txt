Violence

Love

attempts to

constrain the other’s freedom, to force him to act in a way we desire,
but with an ultimate lack of concern, with

indifference to the other's

own existence.

We are effectively destroying ourselves by violence masquerading
as love ............ each person, not being himself, either to himself or the
other, just as the other is not himself to himself or to us, in being
another for another neither recognizes himself in the other, or the

other in himself.

consciousness.
