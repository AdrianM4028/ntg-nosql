the basement

experimental
studio

This will perhaps be the most exciting part of the building. A cafeotype experimental studio will function here. It
is anticipated that performances will be held here everyday—
avant-garden theatre, new plays by Indian play-wrights will
have an opportunity to be produced at minimal cost, popconcerts, poetry-readings anything in the world of the arts
that is dynamic, new. untried. off the regular ‘beat.’ Here
young people from all over the city. primarily the university,
will congregate for an exchange of ideas and exciting dialogue.

It is designed for YOUNG people, as a kind of place for exploration, a place where young people from every walk of life can
get to know the arts.
