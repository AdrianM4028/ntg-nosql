This will be a foyer in the real sense of the word—a
place where audiences can gather before performances and
during intervals. The foyer overlooks the garden and has been
created to provide ample space for exhibitions of painting and
sculpture. Its entrance is from the side, and the front will
be completely glazed with sliding glass doors to enable guests
to step out into the garden. Near the foyer there is provision for a restaurant which will also open onto a side garden.
In addition to this, there is a sheltered space at the back
of the ticket-office where coffee and snacks will be available
after performances and where artists may meet members of
t h e audience.
