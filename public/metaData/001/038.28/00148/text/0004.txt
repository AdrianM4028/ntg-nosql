mainstage and auditorium
The great attraction of the theatre is the intimacy between the stage and the auditorium—between the actor and the
audience. Many different types of performances will be given
here—plays, music, ballet, ﬁlms. There will be many different
kinds of audience too—children, young adults, families. Ultimately it is hoped that there will be many performances
everyday.

The theatre can be used not only for conventional
' picture frame’ productions. but also for more Open styles.
This has been provided for by the low level of the stage, the
‘apron’ and the provision for a “thrust stage.’ The front rows
of chairs will be removable allowing for great flexibility in
production. The proscenium has a 38ft Opening and Is l8ft in
height. The stage is 25ft in depth up to the cyclorama with the

provision of another 5ft behind the cyclorama and a 5ft apron
making a total of 35ft in stage depth. The stage roof is 50ft
high allowing for the ‘ﬂying’ of any curtains. The auditorium
will seat about 400 and the gallery, an additional ISO persons.
At the back of the stage there is dressing room space
and a workshop. The false ceiling will extend right from the
back of the auditorium up to the top of the proscenium arch.
The front curtain will carry through the circular shape. Special
acoustical treatment has been provided to ensure the best

possible sound effects.
