I don’t see anything wrong in that. In fact, I see it as a positive quality

that we have and it can be used to very good effect rather than crippling
us. If it can be properly channelled, it can be a very valuable asset.

I think that you are right.

Up to this time one has felt ashamed of the emotional

content of oneself and felt that one is not sufﬁciently analytical but there are two
things there —- I do feel that in contemporary India one has to be analytical, make
connections outside oneself—but, at the same time, if one is capable of feeling
deeply one should not be ashamed of it.

The only difﬁculty is that all these emotions get concentrated on one person
who either makes or breaks you

WHY THE SNOBBISHNESS ?
Well, my father is not really snobbish

He only has a feeling of lnferiority. When

I was about four or ﬁve 1 remember him complaining to his friends about my
mother and I would be listening from behind the couch. So right from the
beginning I have a thing against my mother—I always imagined she was a

“Churail” or something after my father’s blood Which wasn’t strictly speaking
true— it was just one side of the picture. But I still get the feeling that my
father’s friends are not particularly fond of my mother. She never made a movie
to be accepted also. When she does it it’s always on a note of condescension.
Probably because she’s more educated. She doesn’t make any bones about letting
my father know that she’s superior.

1T lS BECAUSE SHE’S EDUCATED ?

No, I think my father comes from the village and the never really grew up. He
still behaves as if he’s in a village though he’s been in the city for about 30 years.

The basic tendency hasn’t changed. My mother, though from an orthodox family.
prides herself on her cultural background.
