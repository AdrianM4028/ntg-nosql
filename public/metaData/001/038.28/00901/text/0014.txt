WAT C H I N G R E H E A R S A L 8

Watching rehearsals is warning yourself with the actors fires
while they put on make-up without any greasepaint
Watching rehearsals is listening to arguments drown in teacups,
holding on to the directors lifeline and not letting go.

Watching rehearsals is observing patterns of intensity fluctuate.
and seeing people be.

You stumble on your lines
and the strain of being someone else
shows in the shadows on your face.
That’s in the beginning
and then you can breathe her in.
The lines come easy and less jagged now
you can talk about her
like she was a friend you made last night
at the busstop after rehearsal was over.

You correct other people’s opinions of her
and even share secrets, sometimes.
But you'll have to show her to us
bring her outside yourself and into
the glare of 1000 watt bulbs.
Make her move,
move us and yourself as well.
its a lot like childbirth, especially the effort
and sometimes the pain.
Youv'e got to be careful
you could murder your child otherwise.

The first show is like high tide,
surging on to the shoreline of the last rehearsal.
When it ebbs,
it leaves behind shining bits of performance
like magic shells and driftwood.

On the shoreline sand.
