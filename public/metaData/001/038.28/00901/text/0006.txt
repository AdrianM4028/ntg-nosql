This evasion of reality, the hiding'of the grim . realities of our lives through escape into either a

vision of the past or a dream of the future is the binding factor between Padma of ‘Rakt Pushp’ and Mama
of a
in ‘Night Mother'. Padma the quintessential petty bourgeosie contemporary woman is on the verge

breakdown and the play delicately but devastatingly probes her splintered psyche through her interactions
with husband, daughter and surrogate son/lover.
Mama’s impassiOned attempts to keep her daughter Jessie alive in ‘Night Mother’ deals with
another kind of coping. Pushed to the end of the road Jessie, the all too familiar woman next door takes the
ultimate plunge, assuming responsibility for her own life and ultimate death. The battle between mother and
daughter in this play is surely one of the most poignant in contemporary world drama.
Strangely . enough, despite Ruchika’s pro-feminist stance over the years, Marsha Norman‘s and
Karnala Ramachandani’s plays are the first woman playwrights we are performing. Earlier we have adapted
other material by women writers - Mahasveta Devi, Karnala Das, Sonrexa. It seems to be clear however
that it is only when women themselves start writing for the theatre, that the theatre will finally be able to

play a vital role in the iiberatiOn of both men and women from their traditional, conservative, entrapping
