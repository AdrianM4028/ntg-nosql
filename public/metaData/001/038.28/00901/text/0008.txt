T O T H E AUDIENCE
Relations between people can't be described

Without using values
But a play is about the nature of values
How can you know its meaning when you need values to find it ?

Perhaps your values are being questioned
Certainly a play must question or strengthen them
Well, people are on the move and so doors are open
Communication is possible
The artist admits he may be wrong
He hopes he hasn’t attracted your attention unnecessarily
He says only that to write he used the values by which he lives
And that for you only this is inescapable :
In Judging his play you use the values by which you live
And show who you are— it is inescapable
Art can’t avoid this effrontery
It describes the relations between people and so the spectator is judged
At least this makes criticism democratic
But remember : democracy is a more wrathful tyrant than a dictator
