become
various centres are no longer mere Creche schools but have
at
nity
community centres. Every event of joy or sorrow of the commu
are celebrated in
the work site is reﬂected in the centre; marriage f’easts
gs, and
the Creche school-shed, workers often relax there in the evenin

amonthly ﬁlm shows, adult-literacy classes, and family-planning motiv
tion programmes are also conducted there.
An important fringe beneﬁt of this community consciousness is that
it has helped to weed out age-old caste prejudice.

Initial opposition

from parents in allowing their children to eat or play with those of
other religions or castes has gradually died down considerably.
The Mobile Creches have thus almost achieved their basic goal of
combining a Creche, Balwadi, school, vocational training for older chil-

dren, and adult education programmes in one small centre.

What is

urgently still lacking is governmental help in implementing relevant
labour legislation, willing cooperation from building contractors, more
tangible support from various social welfare agencies, and willing volunteers who can tackle the problems ahead.
‘Mobility in our context means a rootless, nomadic existence’ is the
watchword of the Mobile Creche movement. And they are seeking to

ﬁght it with ‘social action’ and not just ‘social work’!
