ABOU BEN ADHEM (WHOSE TRIBE, INCIDENTALLY, NEVER
INCREASED) WHO WAS GIVEN TO INSOMNIA CAUSED
BY THE VAGUE FEAR THAT HE WAS LOSING IN THE LORDLOVERS CLASSIC WHEN, TRUTH TO TELL, HE WAS
SEVERAL LENGTHS AHEAD OF ALL CONTENDERS IN THE FIELD
WHICH FACT, _ ALAS, BEING CONCEALED FROM HIM,
३ HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO THE EDGE OF DESPAIR WHEN HE MET HANDICRAFTS. NOW HE SLEEPS WITH DEEP DREAMS OF PEACE.
