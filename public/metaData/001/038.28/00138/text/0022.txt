You might wonder what cosmetics have to do with an
electronics company like ours. Plenty. A little particle of
powder or nail polish on the production line can be disastrous

to our high reliability. That’s why we make sure that our
women employees remove their make-up before they get down
to work. As a further guarantee against dust particles, we
even have a 5-micron dust control system. Taking care of

every detail has made us what we are — a reliable company.
We manufacture: Silicon Transistors
