BILLOO CHADHA

TANGO, written in post-Stalin Poland, is set against a back-drop of ideas.
The dance, itself a whiﬁ‘ of far-off days, becomes a clear symbol of
rebellion that begs direction, where means serve no future but become an
end in themselves. But this is no didactic piece. The form it takes is
of a knockdown domestic farce, in the best traditions of Feydeau and
Ionesco, in which meaning takes a second seat to comic action.

Because of this duality, the play is a great challenge to any director
of comedy. The balance between instruction and amusement is a ﬁne
one. And Mrozek is well aware that sugar is better bait than vinegar.
Difﬁcult as it is to assemble a cast in Delhi, with its sudden enthusiasms and even more sudden ennui, it is both a surprise and a pleasure
to work with a cast that understands and appreciates the actor-director

relationship, a group that is concerned with bringing a play to life rather
than prima donna performances.
As the father, Stomil, says ‘Today farce is the only thing possible’.
This is the keynote of our production. The play becomes a fuzzy peach.
