Tango: the play and the
author

SLAWOMIR MROZEK, AN OUTSTANDING contemporary dramatist in the
Polish theatre today, was born in 1930. The play Tango was ﬁrst
performed in 1964 at the Warsaw Theatre. The two great moving

interests that may seem to contribute towards Mrozek’s attitude, which
are certainly evident in this play, are football and logic.

But one of his

characters says in Tango: ‘This is not a game of intellectual ping-pong,
this is life.’
The crux then of Mrozek’s explorations through the play, as Jano

Kott puts it, is that ‘the theatre is a certain order of signs, a certain
order of images by whose means today’s anxieties, today’s sensitivity,
today’s understanding of the world are expressed as clearly as, and sometimes more thoroughly than, by the spoken or the written word’.

The political climate at the time that Tango was ﬁrst performed in
Warsaw cannot certainly be ignored.

But again, as Jan Kott states

with perception, ‘if a play can be transferred with its essential elements
to another experience and remain valid and effective, it is the best proof

that the play is very good’.
Bearing this statement in mind, we should enjoy the laughter for its

own sake and recognise the sorrow also as momentary.

For life is

MrOZek’8 theme, and human experience as seen from a particular point
of view. He rests between tears and laughterand tries to understand
the spirit and temper of the times—our times.
