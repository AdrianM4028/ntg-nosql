Ir ALL STARTED—LIKE MOs'r THINGS—With a very simple question:
Shouldn’t the children of Delhi’s construction workers do something
other than play and sleep in the cacophony and confusion of the worksite?
The answer to that initial query was the ﬁrst mobile creche. Started
in March, 1969, at the Gandhi Darshan worksite, it had a humble
beginning: One worker, 40 babies, a tent, and a modicum of supplies.
But the concept of a creche solely for babies had to fail, for (as the most

casual observer of Indian life will attest) babies in India are rarely found
far from the watchful eyes and open arms of older brothers and sisters.
So what began as a creche was quickly transformed into a creche-cumschool; indeed, today a complete day care centre. But names stick, and
so it remains as we know it today, the Mobile Creche.

‘Mobile’ because it’s a program designed for Delhi’s most mobile
population—the 60,000 Rajasthani construction workers. Years ago it
was the Punjabis who ﬁlled these ranks, but when agricultural improvements drew them back home, the job fell to Delhi’s neighbours, the

Rajasthanis. Dressed in brilliant colours, jewelry, and smiles, they can
be spotted all over Delhi. Their children and homes are less picturesque.
For their daily labour these men and women earn Rs. 3.50, yielding, if both parents work, a daily family income of Rs. 7. Whenever
possible, the women do work and the children must cope by themselves.
Having lived in a migrant state for most of their lives, it is no wonder
that they are, for the most part, malnourished, illiterate, and fearful of

the community at large.
Into this situation came Meera Mahadevan and Devika Singh. Separately, but simultaneously, they decided something had to be done.
