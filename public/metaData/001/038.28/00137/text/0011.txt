PETER SHAFFER is a major British

dramatist.

He achieved an out-

standing success with his first stage play FIVE FINGER EXERCISE (1958) .
an effective emotional drama of middle-class
double-bill of comedy-drama, THE PRIVATE

life.

Later works include a

EAR and THE PUBLIC EYE

(1962), an ambitious play about the Spainish invasion of the Inca empire, THE

ROYAL HUNT OF THE SUN (3964) and a second double-bill THE WHITE
LIARS and BLACK COMEDY (1965). THE BATTLE OF SHRIVINGS
(1970) with John Geilgud was very successful.

Both THE WHITE LIARS and BLACK COMEDY are studies in
deception“.

Peter Shaffer

describes both plays as ‘a complete evening’s

entertainment on the theme of tricks’. Sophie, in THE

WHITE

LIARS

asks, the question which we may well ask, “Is it really such a crime to want to

shield yourself just a

little from the sordidness of everyday life? Is It?”
