“In war of course, such a charge (manoeuvre) would be impossible
, but all the
same it is a grand spectacle".
~ The Kaiser
"Different coloured cords are hung around rnen’s necks as an in
signia of marksmanship that will only interfere with the handling of their rifles
. Ambition was
incited instead of developing a sense of duty. Uniforms ar
e being made even
more bright instead of being made inconspicous. Military
exersices are being
turned into theatrical performances".
~ an Officer comments

The Army everyone wanted to be in

Because of the privileged position accorded to the army e
veryone
wanted to be in it, even if it were only as an ambulance-ma
n, a
stretcherbearer or a driver of a train. Every offical wanted
to be
at least a “Summer Lieutenant" (Reserve Officer). This post
was
much sought after as it held the key to middle-class respect an
d
professional advancement.
"We are destined to great things and I am leading you to
marvellous times."

Great Britain, France and Russia took note of the boast, and wh
en
the World War came, they were allied against their common
enemy‘—
the Kaiser’s Germany.
