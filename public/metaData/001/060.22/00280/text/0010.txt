to a new residence the police had to be notified and a card filled.
If someone hired a servant girl she had to be registered on a yellow

There were hundreds of petty regulations which prescribed what was
“verbotten” (forbidden). It was “verbotten” to walk on the grass,
'verbotten to enter a place reserved for children, ’verbotten to bicycle
on a particular path and so on. If one violated a regulation, one had

The Arts

PA l N T l N G
There were basically two tendencies which could define the artistic
achievements in germany over the one hand painters like Piloty,
Market and Achenbach depicted life idealisti‘cally rather then critically
and thus satisfied the middle-class need for entertainment.
Other painters could not remain completely indifferent to the more
realistic, less idealising contemporary views of the world. They broke
new ground when they began to paint subjects from the world of

industry and labour (Adolf Menzel 1815-1905) and did not hesitate
to present proletarian reality in all honesty and candour (Kathe

Kollwitz 1867-1945). Max Lieberrnann (1847-1935) with Max
Slevogt (1868-1932) and Louis Corinth (1858-1925) headed the
German impressionistic school of painting.
