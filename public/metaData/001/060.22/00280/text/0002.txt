The Second Reich
After the defeat of the French the Second Reich had been proclaimed
in the Palace of Versailles in 1871 with Kaiser Wilhelm l as the
German Emperor, and Otto von Bismaer as Chancellor of Germany.
Bitter experiences had taught the Germans that military weakness
was a political crime. Germany maintained a standing army of
402,000 and began to build up an efficient navy.
In 1888 Kaiser Wilhelm died, to be succeeded for 99 days by his
son Friedrich, whose sudden death brought Kaiser Wilhelm II (18881918) to the throne at an early age. His personal and political fears
together with his youthful sense of insecurity led him into conflict

with Bismarck
In March 1890 he dismissed the ageing Bismarck.
