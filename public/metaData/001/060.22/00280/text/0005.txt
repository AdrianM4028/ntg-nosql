Before Industrialization

1871 In d u stri a Ii zat ion
The coming of the Industrial age transformed a nation of peasants,
craftsmen

and small traders into a nation of labourers.

By the

end of 1871 German production outdistanced that of France. By the
beginning of the new century Britain had been surpassed and when
World War I broke out in 1914 Germany was the second largest
industrial nation in the World, close behind the USA. There were
now 48 towns in Germany compared to 8 in 1870. The population
had risen to 68 million whereas it had remained stagnant 4 decades
earlier. There were 4 million unemployed.
