German Youth
The making of a German citizen was the making of a German
and indeed the making of a German nation. The life of a
German was divided into 4 military terms ; the actual service
the reserve period, the ’landwehr' period and the ’landstrum’

soldier
young
period,
period.

The formative years of a young man were his years in service. There

he was taught obedience and orderliness, he became used to hard
work, plain living and frugality. On the other hand in those years
his individuality was weakened, his initiative deadened and he
acquired a life- long habit of dependence upon authority.

Towards the end of the 19th century a development entirely peculiar
to Germany was the rise of a Youth Movement. I n 1898 pupils from
the Berlin gymnasium founded the “Wondervogel”——A protest
against the middle class civilization which had grown up in the
second half of the 19th century. It was also a fight for those
elements of the cultural legacy not reducible to national terms.
