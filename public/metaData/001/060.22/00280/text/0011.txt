are characterized not only by the influence of French irnpressionisrn
but by their social message as well.

The leading representative of Naturalism in the field of drama was
Gehart Hauptrnarm (1862-1946). The naturalists sought new fields
of expression, far more in keeping with the spirit of the age. Like the
youth movement it brought home to the middle class the shallowness and show morality of their world. However, naturalisrn sornewhat exhausted itself in criticism, for it lacked the vitality to present
an alternative philosophy of life.

It continued in the tradition of Beethoven. The age found its most
powerful artistic expression in the unified works of Richard Wagner
(1813-1883). No doubt, opinions are still divided on the subject of
his dramatic and musical productions, but it can hardly be denied
that Wagnerion music and writing struck such an answering cord in
in his contemporaries, because it offered his godless and materialistic
age, new myths and gods. Although the question of man's salvation
formed the background of all his endevours, the answer he gave
remained, in the final analysis, vague. ln clothing the great problems
of life in the language of mythology, he failed to shake and transform man.

No one was more conscious of the artists responsibility to his own
age than Freidrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), the poet and philosopher.
He was the declared enemy of all that could be called the spirit of
his age. He rejected traditional religion, the national state, liberalism,
philosophy and artistic production upto and including Wagner. In
this sense he overthrew all traditional values, sincerity and honesty
led him to declare quite openly ’God is Dead. The world is
Purposeless ’. However his courageous and affirmative attitude to
life led him to the belief, in yet another world.
