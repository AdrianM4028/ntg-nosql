to her husbands, she maintained upright values in times of crises, and rejected
such vices as gambling. Her protest before the attempted disrobing is well
known, and in the forest she took Yudhisthira to task for causing all the trouble

through his false pride and addiction to gambling.
Although Draupadi is filling feminine space, her story is incomplete
without her hero, the one Draupadi calls ‘Friend’—Sakhd, and who in turn
only calls her Sakhi. The friendship between Draupadi and the dark Krsna—

is unique. There are five heroes to ‘protect’ her, but it is Krsna who protects
not only Draupadi but also her five protectors. When the protectors of the
feminine are arrogant and ignorant we know how well Draupadi is cared for,
but when the protector is a friend, her glory is rescued and restored. She
is the only woman we know of who is truly Krsna’s friend—she can ask,

and he will deliver. Draupadi survives all the tragedy in her family-—sons and
grandson slaughtered—~but when she hears that her Friend has left his body,
she immediately leaves hers.
The Upanisadic story gives us the streotype of the male/female relationship, but the story of. Draupadi’s friendship with Sri Krsna adds a further
dimension to this relationship. There is nowhere any hint of any erotic relationship between the perfect male and female, only a very complete friendship.
On the canvas of human life, the picture is complete with the he and she
together: a relationship not of separation but of working together, not of
arrogance on either side, but of real friendship.
