J .R. D. TATA
1 904 -1993
Mr. J.R.D. ’I‘ata, in response to a question from an
educationist in 1965 about the “guiding principles of his

life that had kindled his path”, wrote in reply that such
guiding principles that he may unconsciously have had in
his life could be summarised in the following words:
Nothing worthwhile is ever achieved without deep
thought and hard work;

One must think for oneself and never accept at their
face value slogans and catch phrases to which,
unfortunately, our people are too easily susceptible;

One mustforever strivefor excellence, or even perfection,
in any task, however small, and never be satisﬁed with
the second best;
No success or achievement in material terms is worth-

while unless it serves the needs or interests of the
country and its people and is achieved by fair and
honest means;

Good human relations not only bring great personal
rewards but are essential to the success of any
enterprise.
