of Odissi music.
16th and 18th centuries, authentic Odissi ragas, such as, Prathamamanjari, Varadi,

Madhukiri, Ramakiri, etc. have been revived and the style of singing, which
was becoming like Hindustani music, has been cleansed to bring back its original
ﬂavour and distinctiveness.

Another significant project which has been successfully completed is setting
to tune the astapadz's of Geeta-Govinda in a particular raga as indicated by Jayadeva,
the author.
Founded in 1977, the Centre has also endeavoured to feature in its

programmes all the top ranking dancers of all the art dance styles. No other
voluntary organisation, especially founded by a dancer, has taken such initiative.
The list of events and activities of the Centre is given below:
