scene, albeit short, to highlighting this tenderness and abhijatya. Anyone who enjoyed
Krishna’s unstinted admiration and whose words merited immediate action by him
deserves my unbound and awestruck devotion.
Her own sense of duty and responsibility to the family she is married into
does not allow her to accept any compromises even when the eldest among her
husbands with the title of ’Dharmaraja’ (Master of the code of correct ethics of life)
is willing time and again to let things be. This paragon of Virtue—Yudhishthira—
a gambler and a weak-minded man, jeopardises her life as also those of his brothers.
He puts her as stake in the game of dice in the most reprehensible and unpardonable
act, treating her as chattel, a property, a possession, whereas Duryodhana, the roguecousin does not stake his own wife. When Draupadi questions the ethics and morality
of such games and conduct, no one has the answer. All that she gets is undiluted
scorn from the Kauravas, a weak-kneed sermon from Bhishrna and a stony silence
from Yudhishthira! An intelligent woman capable of arguing out her case and
showing up chinks in male logic proves too much even today, so to whom could
Draupadi turn for help then?
