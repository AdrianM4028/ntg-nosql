Draupadi is seen as the centre of three polarities, created by the Pandavas,
the Kauravas and Krishna. Mannequins representing these polarities are used
to create a counterpoint which results in a confrontation between them and
Draupadi. Their presence provides a thematic context and creates the central
conflict in which Draupadi finds herself; and these are constantly juxtaposed
with Draupadi’s predicament. The fact that these mannequins are static forms,
adds another dimension because it accentuates the dynamism of her movement
as well as her expressions. The mannequins on the stage may represent Krishna,
Arjun, the other Pandavas or the Kauravas. The characters that they represent

are not necessarily identified with a particular mannequin. The same mannequins
may represent one set of characters at a particular moment, while in other
sequences, they may symbolize another group of people. These changes are
created by Draupadi’s suggestion of who they are, in her rendering of a sequence.
Therefore the characters are defined by Draupadi herself, in her interaction with
them and become the metaphors of her actions. Their mere presence on the
stage is sufficient to give her the option of changing their image in time and
space, creating a structure that is non-linear and non-sequential. This is
essentially the concept which Amal creates when she structures Draupadi’s
movements, using idioms from different dance forms, and introducing a
performance language that transforms the expression of dance into drama. The
collaborative parallels that are thus created between the director, the dancer and
the designer, become the basis of a new form of expression.
