DIRECTOR'S NOTE
Hammad Farooqui

hat the director wants to
say is actually said
through his production only. This
creation of "Khubsoorat Bahu"
has
a
unique
place
in
contemporary Hindi Drama. In
today's world of multinational
culturalism
and
cultural—
nationalism and insensitive set—up

and
system,
man—woman
relations are becoming more and
more complex and distorted. Is
the woman really free from those
bonds, conventions and values

which have always been kept
intact by the man for his
possessive lewdness‘? Today even
after making the impossible into
possible. have the gender in—
equalities ended?
I personally feel, indebted
to the whole team of Theatre
Space, colleagues on stage and
back stage without whose support
the production would—n't have
been possible. A warm welcome
to the ‘audience’, because theatre

is incomplete without them.
