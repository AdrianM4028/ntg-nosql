The Playwright

The great dramatist William
Shakespeare was born in April 1564.
By 1592, at the age of twenty

eight he was writing and acting
regularly. The ﬁrst reference

to this is found in a rival
playwright’s acidic remarks about
ShakeSpeare as an actor and
playwright,~ calling him an
“upstart crow” and “a conceited
‘ Shakescene’ ’ ’ .
The poetic sensibility of

Shakespeare is abundantly expressed .
in his sonnets and plays. When
Shakespeare wrote Othello,

the ﬁrst of his series of tremendous
tragedies, his knowledge of
human nature and his ability to

dramatise it in language and
action were at their height.

The play oﬁ‘ers a number of
unusually full and profound
studies of humanity. The

vision of human nature which
the play offers is one of primal
chaos underlying the smooth,
civilized surfaces.
Othello is considered one of the
most neatly constructed of

ShakeSpeare’s plays.
Shakespeare died at the age of
ﬁfty-two ,
