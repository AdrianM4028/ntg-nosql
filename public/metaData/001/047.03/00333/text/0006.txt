Director’s Note

The play is about the deadliness
of human virtues in a world
which has been turned into a
market—place where humanity is
for sale, Where “preferment
goes by letter and affection. . . 9 3

(I, i)
where the “best conscience is not

to leave’t undone, but keep’t
unknown. .” (III, iii)
Where “a free and open nature

that thinks man honest that but.
seem to be so” can therefore

be “led by the nose as asses are . .”
(I, iii)
Where one can “turn (one’s)
virtue into pitch, and out of (one’s)

own goodness make the net that
shall enmesh them all . ,”

(II, iii)
As the arm of Venice Othello
was “noble” and “valiant”—~when
he dared to live like a human

being, he was “a thing—to fear,
not to delight” (I, iii)
accused “of arts inhibited” and
“witchcraft” and made an
outlaw: “for if such actions

may have passage free, bondslaves
and pagans shall our statesmen
be” (I, ii)
The play is not about monsters
but about a monstrous world.
