Translator’s Note

Fritz Bennewitz teaches his
actors that what they are to

do or say should rise from within
their own perception of society and
reality rather than from some
imposed style. Here the signiﬁcance
of Shakespeare’s language
increases many fold for it, too,

encourages the same principle of
acting. For this reason Shakespeare
cannot be translated successfully if
the language is at odds with
the logic of acting. The language
of Shakespeare is a language

constructed from the logic of acting,
it is not right to impose on it the
language of contrived acting.
The tradition of modern Hindi
poetry today possesses such

attributes that can take up this
challenge. How far my translation

has been able to do this work
will be for the audience to say.
Like Bamam Vana, translation of

Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Othello
was also translated for the NSD
Repertory Company at the
request of the director, and, like
Barnam Vana, is being presented to
the spectator ﬁrst rather than
to the reader.

During the translation the actors
trusted me with their counsel and
Fritz insisted on necessary ammendments for which I am grateful.
