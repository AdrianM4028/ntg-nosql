According to the curriculum of the NSD, it is important for a student to be exposed to any particualr folk tradition and
therefore Yakshagana, the folk form of Karnataka has been used in this production of ’Chandr'ahasa’. The point sought
to be clarified is that this production is not an exercise in Yakshagana but a vice-versa.
Another point of prime importance for students of the NSD is that the introduction to the form pen se is not useful.
Instead one has to capture the creative spirit, understand the local talent and grab the mastery which interestingly is
not of an individual but of a community.
A fantastic quality of our folk traditions is that by breaking all barriers of time and space they make themselves vast
and immortal. All this is achieved in a limited area of mere 20 to 30 feet. Episodes suited to such principles are given
special attention. For example, entry-exits, journey, change of characters, imaginary characters, use of language, acting
out of animate as well as inanimate characters, expand imagination of episodes etc. War and love-making are more
difficult to handle. From the theatrical viewpoint, all this is indispensable. As some one has rightly remarked—’Ho'w
many trees make a forest? or How many persons make a group?’

The rest is all presented before you, and now I myself would like to put forward this question to conclude my note :
Is folk tradition important in the presentation of folk lore? or

Is it possible to discover a modern language/ idiom that can actually capture the vibrant life in our folk lore?
Therfore how should one define folk tradition?
