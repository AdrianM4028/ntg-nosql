The curriculum of the National School of Drama includes the study of any
one major folk—theatrical tradition, amongst the many traditions that are
extant in our country today, by the students during the course of their three
year period of learning in the School. This used to take place during the
third year of study hitherto. But this year students in the second year have
been to Karnataka to study Yakshagana, the major folk—theatrical tradition
of the region under the guidance of Shri B.V. Karanth. The project also
includes the production of a play based on the study of such a theatrical
tradition. Chandrahasa is the result of our Yakshagana workshop in
Karnataka .
The workshop was based in Mysore in the premises of the Nataka
Karnataka Rangayana Repertory Company and took place between the
twelfth of May and the fourteenth of June, 1993. In the middle, from the

fourth of May to the thirty first the students were in the coastal town of
Udupi to see demonstrations and performances of Yakshagana: Udupi is
the heart-land of Yakshagana country, so to speak. In Udupi the students
stayed in the premises of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial College which
runs the Regional Resources Centre for Folk Performing Arts. The Udupi
workshop was organised for the School by the Resources Centre in
consultation with Shri Karanth.
In Mysore and Udupi Shri Karanth was assisted, throughout and in the
main, by Shri Gururaja Marapalli and Shri Srinivasa Bhat.
