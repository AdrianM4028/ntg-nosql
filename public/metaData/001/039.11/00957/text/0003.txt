Our play opens to a merchant’s journey to Urga in quest of
petroleum, along with his guide and coolie. This merchant is .
closely followed by another merchant and his troupe. In order to
be foremost in this race of petroleum and make maximum profit,
our merchant. travels all day and night with his men. At Hann
Station, the merchant suspects his guide to be in conspiracy with
the coolie and thus he dismisses the guide.

Even in the absence of a guide, the merchant could not afford
to wait. He therefore asks an inn-keeper at the Hann Station to

explain the road to Urga to his coolie.

The road to Urga is so

complicated that the coolie fails to catch the lessons of the Inn-

keeper.

But he keeps this fact disclosed and

in such an un-

certainty the rnerchant and the coolie restart their journey.
The tedious phase of the journey has now begun.

It grows

worse when the merchant and coolie comes to the flooded Uttala
River. The merchant forces the hesitant coolie to cross the river

and in the process the coolie breaks one of his hands.

They rest

over night in the desert after this.

Next day they resume their journey in the desert and they get
lost. While yet in the desert, when the merchant is Dying of thirst,
the coolie decides to give the merchant the water bottle which
was given to him by the guide at the Han n Station. Mistaking the
bottle to be astone, the merchant shoots the coolie.

The coolie’s file wife a sue in the court to get some monetary
compensation. But in the court of law, the judgement goes in
favour of the merchant.

Thus ends the journey to Urga and the play also.
