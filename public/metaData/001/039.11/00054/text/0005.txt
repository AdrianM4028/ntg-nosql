time.
The human being today is always in a state of
tension and of being scared and frightened, and
is
therefore aggressive.
And the sort of political community
we have is based on utilizing this aggression.
It's got
nothing to do with the world of nature at all,
where
aggression functions in a protective way.
A competitive
society must destroy itself.
There is no alternative,
because this is the whole dialectic of violence
- I
threaten you, you threaten me, and finally you
have to

carry out your threats, otherwise there is no credence
behind them. And also because aggression creates fear
and
this leads to more violence and this has an escal

its own.

o a

it will destroy itself.
it - it will.

Not will it, could it, mi ht
