VIIA Y DAN DETHA 'S D UVI D HA

Less about the performance... ! More
about this term called ”Acting” which
either ”happens” or “doesn’t happen”...!
When it happens, it can be made to

happen in 30 different ways...! A step
forward... a step backward... with
dilemma... confusion... curiosity ..... but
eVerything enjoyable... constructive ....!
When it does not happen, then no
Stanislavasky or Meyerhold or Grotovsky
or Bharat-Muni can help you out. I think
we must try to make it happen in every
show. .. . !
Can acting be practised ”alone”
Like
music or dance or anyother performing
art form ...? Yes....! It can be ....l It must
be ...! Show is the product ....! Rehearsal
.... a process....! But there has to be
something called “the practice....! in a

way

a preparation for the rehearsal....!

And it is high time when we .... the
students of acting... start understanding

5010 performance can be the best way to
explore it ....! Lights, sounds and sets are
m

like bonus....! But if an ”actor” is there on
stage
alone with his imagination
he
must be able to create Sahara deserts or
Alps mountains or river Missisippi or
heaven or hell, all existing or non—existing
things in the universe ...! ”Duvidha” is
about a ghost and his love a bride....!
With warm wishes to all the third year
students of NSD passing out this year....!
Always be proud of being actors
My
friends....! It is a very dignified calling,
engagement... . !
