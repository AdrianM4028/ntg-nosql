My body on ﬁre,
My throat burning,

An eyeball, pleading, rolls.

With a thud
The arm fallen
Sunk
The shoulder
Ah, no further
Can I crawl
Alone, the dark depth,
Throbs in the temples, sudden,
ebbed,
Ah
What, must I
on the roadside, like this,

A boiled—white head.

Away from you

My hands slide through hair and
brains;

mus, rnu

Reeking smoke, ﬂashing ﬁery wind.
In the darkness of the showering

d
i

sparks,

St

Children’s eyes turn gold.
