belly. In other words. his goal in
going out into the daylight and
suffering is not merely to create a
truely human, deeply intimate
relationship which others, but rather
to achieve an unquestinonably

personal tragic death. This is the
essence of his plan. It is the
only death pattern that he can
accept. His pathetic yet heroic death

defying passion is, of course, an
empty illusion to the Invalid’s
nephew, and quite possibly to
Betsuyaku himself. The treatment
given to his “passion” is, thus
appropriately jocular. The Invalid

himself is aware of his situation;
his ears search out voices laughing
at his passion. But he resists, His

repetitious conversations with his
parrot like wife is the last remaining
weapon in his waning arsenal.
Regardless of how old fashioned
and grotesque the passion of the
Invalid may seem to us, what he’s
trying to do is to salvage one story
out of the mass death, the
inoraganic plague wrought by the
atomic bomb. In order to do so, a

pattern of human death must be

preserved—not one shown in the
blood-less rows of numbers

provided by the newspapers and
other organs of mass information,
but one communicable by word of
mouth, one capable of wide
dissemination.
The Man, the quiet nephew of the

invalid, talks of the inadequacy
or rather the impossibility of
any action but he too opens his
mouth to speak. The literature of

silence is in itself a contradition in
terms.
The play, in which no elephant,

nor even an elephant-related subject
appears is titled “The Elephant”.
The fact that the elephant is a
sacred symbol of Buddhism and
stands for human freedom to be
preserved regardless of the mass
murders committed in the
concentration camps or by the

atomic bombs in itself explains the
title well enough. It may also be
noted here that in recent excavations

in Japan elephant-bones have
been found which suggests that

elephants inhabited that land much
before human beings inhabited it.
