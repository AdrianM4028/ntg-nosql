A New on the

Play

Sufferers of the atomic bomb
explosionand victims of the
cadmium—polluted water supplies,
burdened with deformities of
their ﬂesh are forced today to live
as outcasts by the contemptuous,
frightened glances of people around
them. The Invaild’s keloid like the
brands carved into the bodies of

Hiroshima and it is from there that

the play derives its peculiar
theatrical power.
The invalid is terriﬁed of the idea
of dying in his sleep. He’s driven

by the nightmare of Slipping silently
into the darkness. He plans to ﬂee
the hospital, a grotesque society

where the transition from life to
criminals in ancient Greece, or like
the rose shaped bruise set to form

on the skin of the chosen in
Medevial Christian Society functions
as a kind of stigma. His keloid

is proof for all to see that he
belongs to a small group alien to
normal social order and both
evil and sacrosanct; it compels him
towards a cognizance of theatrical
elements at the very centre of

his life. After having been
unintentionally the centre of
attraction in numerous “theatrical
situations” he strikes upon the idea
of taking the initiative in their

creation. He would stand at a major
intersection revealing his keloid,
the hideous stigma covering
his back, and gesturing energetically,
he would tell the story of some

terrible episode to the people who
would gather around. It goes without

and somehow ﬁnd his way back to
“that town”. In contrast to the

ideﬁnable stage before us,
the invalid’s description of “that
town" is concrete a place where it is
always mld-summer, where the sun
glares down and where covered
with dust and sweat the passerbys
seem to simmer in the heat. His
passion is predicated upon a distrored
perspective, a confused sense of
space where what is near is vague
and forrnless and what is far is

bright and set off in bold relief.
The Invalid wants to return to the
town to escape the lukewarm
superintended death that awaits him
in the hospital. Having returned

he will strip in the centre of the
town, cut his arm with a razor,

saying that this is something very

the round of onlookers and shout

close to the performance of old

“I have come all this way covered

story tellers. Betsuyaku’s image

round of applause"! At that point
