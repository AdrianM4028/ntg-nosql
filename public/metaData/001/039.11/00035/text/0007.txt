A heath

My nails in ﬂames,

My heels burnt oil",
A molten lead plate
Stuck on my back,

‘Oh, oh, oh, oh'
Flames,

Telegraph poles, mud Walls
charred.
A whirl of ﬂames and fumes
Penetrating

my cracked skull.
‘Hiro—chan, Hiro—chan!’

Distant screams in the depths of
cars.
Swollen without noise,
A sudden attack
Of tempestuous space, of dark

intensity,
Figures running amuck

My breasts I hold my hands on,
Holes of blood—soaked cotton,

I cry out, lying on the ground,
— where are you, where are you,

where are you ?
crawling and creeping along in the

smoke,

appearing from no where,
Between smoldering eddies
Of lingering dust clouds.

‘Oh
I can escape‘
My body, I jumped up,
Waist ablaze,

Buried in splintered bricks.
The volcanic blast slapped me,
Flames
On the sleeves, on the shoulders.

My frantic hands grasping, in dark

Holding hands together,
Dancing around,
A circle of naked girls.
The circle
stumbles
collapses,
Into the rubble,

Reveals a bare shoulder underneath.
A hairless old woman,
Baked in the heat,
Wrung awry, shrieking

smoke,

A corner of the concrete water tank,
My head dipped
Into the water.

My clothes scorched,
Useless against the ﬁre.
Telegraph lines, timbers, nails, glass
Splinters, walls jolted out of
alignment,

By the searing roadside; the air
simmering.
Distended stomach risen into a
great globe,
Lips inside out,
Lumps of red ﬂesh sitting.
A hand seizes my ankle,
Slips oﬂ, the skin left on my foot.
