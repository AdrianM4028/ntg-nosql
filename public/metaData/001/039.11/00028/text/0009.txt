The play 'SAPNA KALI KA' is a good experience for me.
Some elements of the traditional folk form of KERALA called
Theyyam are used in the play. And I hope this play will
be the 1st play of India and in the history of N.S.D. which
production style is based on Theyyam like movements,
approach and lastly the play ends with the ritual procession

of the Mother Deily KALI.

The form of the play revolves around Theyyam with a very
much relevant story running through it.
It is not a dream but the truth of the present and you are the
most responsible character of the play, so it is only you who

will decide either to accept this dream or to break and create
a new dream.

SAPNA KALI KA mainly based on Theyyam a ritual form of
KERALA. It is my opinion which has got so many dances
with critical rhythms which makes us conscious about rhythm,

movement and mainly ﬂexibility of body.
and drumming has

The ritual dances

got tremendous dramatic action. If we

use in our Theatre, i think we shall be able to open a new
avenue of Indian Theatre which has got real essence of our
