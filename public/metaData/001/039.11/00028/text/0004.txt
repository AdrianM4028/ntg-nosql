D I R E CT O R ’ 8 NOTE
The play ‘SAPNA KALI KA' is an imaginary play of the
playwright. inspired from a Marathi play.
The story is an imagination not only of the playwright, but the

theme is also a imagination of KALI, that is a ‘dream of

KALI'.

‘

We have presented the DREAM OF KALI by the 1st year
students with their co-operation and ideas as well as their
exercise as a Drama. India is a country where cooking,
eating, bathing and sleeping can be regarded as religious".
So if is very difficult to get rid of it in any aspect of daily life
of an Indian.
In this play we have used some rituals which are more or
less common in Indian Folks.
But

the play has its

contemporary

relevance, though

it

seems to be a Mythological play by the title.
And this is our first approach to do experiment in modern
plays, how the Indian elements can be used in Indian Theatre
as we have studied some Folk Forms of KERELA under PILOT
PROJECT,

by National School of Drama, ﬁnding lndianess

in Indian Theatre.
So, I hope that the theatre lovers will help us by suggesting

the right and wrong of our approach through the production
SAPNA KALI-KA.
