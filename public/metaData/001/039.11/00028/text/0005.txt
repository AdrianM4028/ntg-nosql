First of all I should clarify that for writing SAPNA KALl KA
I got InSpiration and idea from a Marathi script CHETNA
CHINTAMANICHE GAON written by Prabhakar Puranik.
This is my flrst attempt of script writing and that too in Hindi
There may be so many defects in writing which l may have
not realised.

one thing should be considered is that the first year students
doing it have just arrived from diﬂ‘erent parts of country

What ever is

good in it is honest work of the participants.
