2
If only to ensure that the theatre remain something special for

him, he foregoes, in private, anything of the theatrical.
However, he does not do without style, whether he is observed
or not.

3

His profession tempts him to two things: to seclude himself
from others, or to throw himself upon others. He must resist
both temptations.
4

His profession entails another temptation: that of pity for
himselfâ€”after all, on the stage he unknowingly invites
commiseration even for rascals. He resists this temptation, too.

5

He must beware of becoming easily vulnerable or invulnerable.
6
What tides him over many things is the art of observation
which he practises at all times. He observes by imitating. And
he invents for the person observed an attitude for many
situations which he cannot observe.
7
He is concerned with himself only in so far as he trains himself.
8

He continuously studies the laws of the behaviour of people
towards each other. Society is his employer; he studies him.

9
He has to develop a sense of pitch for the tone of truth. He
dissembles only to show the truth.
10
There is no joy and no misery from which he holds himself
aloof. He needs these sensations for his work as he has to

strive above all to remain a human being.
