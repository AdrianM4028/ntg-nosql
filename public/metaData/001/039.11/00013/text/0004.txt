My food I ate between the battles
To sleep I lay down among the murderers
Love I practised carelessly
And nature I regarded without patience.
So passed the time
Allotted to me on earth.
All roads led into the mud in my time
My speech gave me away to the slaughterer

I could not do much. But those in power
Would have sat safer without me, I hoped.
So passed the time
Allotted to me on earth.
Our strength was slight. The goal
Lay in the far distance

It could be clearly seen, although it was
Hardly to be reached by me.
So passed the time
Allotted to me on earth.

You, who will rise up out of the ï¬‚ood
In which we have gone under
Think too
When you speak of our weaknesses
Of the dark time
From which you have escaped.
We went, changing our country more often than our shoes

Through the war of classes, puzzled
When there was injustice only and no outcry.
And yet we know:
Hatred, even against degradation
Distorts the features.
Anger, even against injustice
Makes the voice hoarse. Oh, we
Who wanted to prepare the ground for friendliness
Could not ourselves be friendly.
But you, when things have gone so far
That man helps man
Make allowances when you think of us.
