Truly, I live in a dark period.

' “Mm-u» …

The innocuous world is stupid. A smooth forehead
Is a sign of insensitivity. The man who laughs
Has merely not yet been told
The terrible news.
What kind of a period is it when
To talk of trees is almost a crime
Because it implies silence about so many horrors?
That man there who quickly crosses the street
Is probably out of' reach of his friends
Who are in need.
True enough, I still earn my living

But, believe me, that is an accident. Nothing
Of what I do gives me the right to eat myself full.
By accident I have been spared. (If my luck fails
I am lost.)
They say to me, eat and drink. Be thankful for what you have.
But how can I eat and drink if
I am snatching my food away from the hungry and

Someone is thirsting for my glass of water?
And yet I eat and drink.
I would like also to be wise.
The old writers told what wisdom is:
To stand apart from the strife of the world
and to spend without fear

One’s short life
Also to get through without violence,

To answer evil with good.
Not to fulﬁl one’s desires, but to forget
Is held wise.
All this I cannot do:
Truly I live in a dark period.
II
I came to the towns in a time of disorder
When hunger reigned there.

I came among the people in a time of revolt
And I rose with them.
So passed the time
Allotted to me on earth.
