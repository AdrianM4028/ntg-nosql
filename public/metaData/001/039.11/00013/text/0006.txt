Special features of the
Berliner Ensemble by Bertolt Brecht

DH was to be expected, if not hoped, that the tremendous
revolution of the manner of living, working, and thinking
during the introduction of socialism would produce and need
signiﬁcant changes in the arts also. The changes will not only,
as some seem to believe, concern subject matter or only form or
only intention in the arts, but all of them together since they
form a coherent though contradictory whole. The theatre will
be “affected” in particular.

Some special features of the Berliner Ensemble, which

sometimes cause bewilderment, stem from the efforts :

To represent society as capable of being changed
To represent human nature as capable of being changed
To represent human nature as depending on class position
To represent conﬂicts as social conﬂicts

To represent characters with genuine contradictions
To represent development of characters, conditions and
events as discontinuous (proceeding in leaps)
To make the dialectic approach a pleasure

8 To “sublate” the achievements of classicism in a dialectical
sense.
9 To achieve a unity of realism and poetry.
As all these changes (and others which have not been
mentioned) are effected within the sphere of art, the enjoyment
of art by the audience is not lessened but only changed in its
nature. The special, new demands on the actors have as a prerequisite a general training, an instruction in realistic acting
based on observation, natural, and at the same time organised,

which the Ensemble oﬁ°ers its young actors.

ON THE PROFESSION 0F ACTING

As the profession of acting continually calls for great exertions,
the actor has to know how to relax. He avoids at all times
maximum strain and utter laxity.
