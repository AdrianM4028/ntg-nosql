Poem

Of all works my favourite
Are those which show usage.
The copper vessels with bumps and dented edges
The knives and forks whose wooden handles are
Worn down by many hands: such forms
To me are the noblest. Likewise the ﬂagstones around old houses
Which have been trodden smooth by footsteps, ground away
With tufts of grass between them: those
Are happy achievements.

Taken into use by the many
Frequently altered, they improve their shape, become special
By general application.
Even fragments of sculpture
With their sliced-off hands are dear to me. They too
Seem to have lived. They were dropped,
and yet they were carried
They were hacked down, yet they never stood too high.
Dilapidated buildings
Again seem like half-completed
Enormous projects: their ﬁne proportions
Can already be inferred; yet they still need
Our understanding. At the same time
All this
They have served their purpose, been sloughed off.
Delights me.
