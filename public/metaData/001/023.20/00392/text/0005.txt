D. C. BHATTACHARJJ
Chief - Engineer
ALL INDIA RADIO

A Word from our President
‘00 ०0°

Not all people realize the ‘Khana Badosh’ life our engineers
have to lead during their service career in All India Radio. From Leh

to Passighat and Simla to Cal icut we traverse the country in its entire
width and breadth without wearing a visible frown.

Interestingly the movement is in all directions and one
would’ nt be surprised if an engineer from Kerala spends best part of his
years in Gauhati and that from Punjab may saunter along the Marina in
Madras as he grows old.

While some places are good culturally and socially and the
young engineer gets attuned to the

new environments,

there

are spots

es.
which are known for their stark isolation and lack of city ameniti

stand
Our High Power Transmitter installations, generally
other means
out glarineg for absence of recreational facilities and
rs.
essential to keep up the Spirit and morale of our enginee

It is

at these places that we

need

to set—up Community

needs of our engineers and
Centres, equip them adequately to fulfil the

happy to announce that
their .fami l ies isolated from the city life. I am
d at H. P. 'l‘ . Kingsway.
one such Community Centre will soon be constructe

Yours sincerely,
