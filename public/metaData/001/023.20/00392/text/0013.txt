l n this era of eXperimental theatre the Airbeams Club I
has mustered courage to stage a somewhat abstract play

written by

Shri Daya

Prakash Sinha.

The merit of its

abstraction however lies in its eternal topicality : eXploita-

tion of the common man, various aSpects of corruption and
isolation gap between the rulers and the ruled,
The theme is dramatized by authentic sound and

light effects.

The play is ably directed by Shri A. K. Srivastava.
