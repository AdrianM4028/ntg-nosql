Staging a great classical ’Indian play in the year 1933 in
Delhi had both its moments of joy and sorrow, of exhilaration

and depression, because it was a great challenge both for the
director and for the actors.

The actors, 3rd year students of N S D,

were new to this

style evolved from the basic stances, movements,

postures,

gestures, rythms, articulation etc. of our tradition, especially

those of Kerala's Kala ri, Kathak'al‘i etc.

The actors had only a few days of training in Kerala in
these aspeCts, followed by its": intensive practice during the
production. But it was remarkable how they managed to tackle

the rigorou’s disciplines that these traditional. forms involve.

But all. this has its reward, when one considers how, actors
and director drawn from ' all corners of this nation and even
outside it, merge into a commonality of emotion and enactment,

eaéhitrue to his own tradition, yet finally striking a single
hgrmonioéns note whiclrs‘ is. what "unity ३ in diverrity” is all
