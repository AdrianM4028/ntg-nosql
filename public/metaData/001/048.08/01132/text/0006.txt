A DAY AN I

Padayani is a ritualistic entertain-

painted with indigenous natural

ment presented in devi temples in
which the whole . rural community
actively participates. The literal
meaning of Padayani is the array

colours. The materials used for
costumes also are fresh from
nature like the tender coconut
leaves and the like. The Kolam
or head-gear representing many

of an army (Para—army and

ani - row). But it has another
connotation also, signifying the
common folk. This form is
popular in the erstwhile
Travancore state, mainly in

Allepey and Quilon districts.
A performance of Padayani takes
place in the open temple court-yard
for several days with many
ritualistic preliminaries and
theatrical ﬂourishes. The
performers use elaborately
decorated masks, and head-gears
made out of ‘arapanut’ sheaths

spirits (like Bhadrakali, Bhawani,
Kalan, Karakkura etc.) of the

Dravidians concept, are painted
with grotesque ﬁgures on the
sheaths sitted on frames of araca.
Kalankolam is one of the most
interesting numbers representing
the theme of how ‘Markandaya’
was rescued and blessed by lord
Shiva from the clutches of Yama.

Here the actor in the guise of
Kalan or Yama, while dancing
is transformed into the other two

characters, Markendeya and Shiva
in a subtle and suggestive manner
