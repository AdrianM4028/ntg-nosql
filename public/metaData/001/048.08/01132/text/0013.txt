STUDENT’S NOTE

The style of acting employed in this production is based on the
traditional forms of Kerala. This style is an excellent method for
an actor’s training. This not only makes an actor work intensively

on his voice, speech, body movement and his intellectual perceptions but also gives strong exercise for perfect co-ordination of the

three elements Angik. Vachik and Satwik Abhinay while other training
methods concentrate on the fragmented area of voice. speech and
movement where co-ordination work is done in completely different
circumstances, not connected with training.

One would notice that both gestures and speech are elongated,
for/creating the Bhavas in it entirely.
In this form body posture, voice intonations and facial expression
would express the same emotion (Bhava). Speech acts as a
bridge
between the Angik and Vachik Abhinaye, so we can say
that the whole
personality of an actor is expressing one idea. This technique
of acting
which is developed at one level of concept projecting
one idea can be

effectively used with modern methods and concept of actin
g, which we
have obtained from west.
