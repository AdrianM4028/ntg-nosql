Director's Note

In to-day's grim and violent tions. At these cross roads one
has to find shelter and

situation, what is needed per-

haps is an objective and relaxed look at the situation and
happenings around us. As the
political positions blur, the
most fundamental questions
of one's life, death and survival in this saddening
स्थ्यदृ, may give a feelng of elplessness. Perhaps
the ability to laugh, to make
fun and sit up and look at our
world minutely is the only
way to be able to relate to
universal values which are
getting replaced by petty
priorties and gains. What tri-

hormony which is like racing

against time and fighting
against the tide, leaving aside
the meaningless political positions and instead probing
the universal against the mundane problems of day to day
living.

I am' personally grateful to
Shamshad for having done a
wonderful job of painting the
background panels forthe set.

umphs is betrayal, d ishonesty,
commerce and selfish ambi-
