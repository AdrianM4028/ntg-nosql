‘—* To promote theatrical activities in the Punjab, "Nat-Shala was established by a group of
enthusiastic young men some years .ago. The. main... aims of the club as outlined. in - the (constitution
include, the propagation of"'Punjabi-theatre_ among. many others. Ordinary membership is. open to all
those in agreement with the aims and objects of the organisation. Cooperation, on reciprocal basis
with all other organisations working for the similar cause is a set precedent of the Nat-#Shala. Donation
is the only other source of income apart from membership fee. Liberal dOnations are .urgently required as
their is lot more to'-beaccomplished as yet. The artists ' working so hard are contributing all of their
might. But that alone' is not enough. Theatrical arts all over the country are in need of patronisation.
' '३ In the brief period of about three years, the Nat—Sharla has preseni ed a- number of plays. The
reSponse was very encouraging every time, for which . the :nr‘nembers are I, really grateful to the theatre
lovers of Patiala. Every time you come to witness a performance, you are patronising a noble cause !
