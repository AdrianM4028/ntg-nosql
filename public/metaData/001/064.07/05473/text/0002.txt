ﬂdom‘. {lie group
To promote theatrical activities in the Punjab, Nat-Shala was established by a group of
enthusiastic young men some years ago. The main aims of the club as outlined in the constitution
include, the propagation of Punjabi theatre among many others. Ordinary membership is open to all
those in agreement with the aims and objects of the organisation. Co-operation, on reciprocal basis
with all other organisations working for the similar cause is a set precedent of the Nat—Shala. Donation

is the only other source of income apart from membership fee. Liberal donations are urgently required as
their is lot more to be accomplished as yet. The artists working so hard are contributing all of their
might. But that alone is not enough. Theatrical arts all over the country are in need of patronisation.
In the brief period of about three years the Nat-Shala has presented a number of plays. The

response was very encouraging every time, for which the members are really grateful to the theatre
lovers of Patiala. Every time you come to witness a performance, you are patronising a noble cause !
