"lma Keithel” is an old market in lrnphal, run
exclusively by women, where all village products are
sold. The dirty, broken tin sheds, built by the British in
1892, still don't have minimal facilities like toilets,
drinking water and lights etc. The Government
decided to demolish this slum like area and build a
plaza-complex there. The vendors smelt the design of
the
of
decision
some high— ups behind this
Government. They started protesting and tinally the
Gove. nrnent yielded to their protests.
This is a true story in which Aryan Theatre has

taken active part from the vendors side.

to re-actualize the

there is greater emphasis is on the use of body, voice
and rnov ment. Excerpts from news papers are also
used as dialogues.
