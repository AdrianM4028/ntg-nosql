Mr. Jnani Sankaran (Tamilnadu) said
though the play had its limitations as a realistic play, the scope for f'olk elements were
there unutilised. The jamukula vadu who
went about creating awareness logically would
have made use of his f'olk form, his best
medium of communication. But in the play
this aspect did not come through at all. Mr.
A. J. Chidambara Rao (Karnataka), said the
play was outside the realms of using f'olk
elements in modern sensibility. Whereas in
‘Antigone’, physicalisation of folk elements
in tune with the theme took place, the Telugu
play did not contain such f'olk elements. Mr;
Ramadas felt the need for enriching and re—
juvenating the folk element in a modern play
remained unfulﬁlled. Mr. Raju felt the script
and the acting were very good but the visuals

were lacking.

Mr. Adil Rao and Ms. Jayapradha (Andhra Pradesh) strongly felt that the role of
jamukula vadu was very eﬂ‘ective in the play.
The use of a folk artiste as an agent ofchange
was competently done, they said. The depicd

‘Sneha’ means love and ‘dootan’ means
messanger. ‘Snehadootan’ is messanger of
love.

The emergence of determined saintly,

loving Buddha from the passive and compassionate young prince of'Sudhodhana’s palace
is the core of the play .

The play has been conceived and adapted
by the director in such a way, considering its
relationship to Indian art, aesthetics and philosophy, which give ample scope for juxtaposing splendour with divinity in all aspects.
The presentation reﬂects a deﬁnite background, the golden era in Indian culture civi-

lisation i. e. the Gupta period.

The Budhist

art and descipline is much related to the
Gupta culture that we cannot differentiate
each other. In the process of the deveIOpment
of the production it has drawn elements from
certain folk and traditional forms of Kerala
and also from plastic art, yoga, martial art,
classical dances, classical music, etc.
