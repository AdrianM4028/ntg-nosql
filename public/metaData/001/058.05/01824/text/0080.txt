an unusual,

new

dimension

because the

narrative IS working simultaneously at three
levels. It uses a mela, two prose narrators
and the action itself. The story deals with
the perennial f'olk preoccupations like death,
evil, fertility, guest for meaning, earth-sky

symbolism, etc. The bare plot has a Gowda,
head of the village, going out to hunt a tiger
and being killed by a demon. The demon
askes the gowda’s form and impregnates his
wife. The son learns of the truth from his
father’s ghost and to rid the village of the
curses that have fallen upon it ever since the
demon’s arrival, starts out in search of the
demon’s lif'e source which is hidden in a parrot in a distant place. His mother calls him
and puts him to sleep, takes the son’s pro-

tective weapons given by the witches
handsthem over to the demon.

that something drew his attention strongly
but he could not point out what. He also
felt that the play did not use ‘proper theatre
language’. Referring to the appearance of
the ghost he said realistic drama uses a different approach to this and that the direction
should have used an approach appropriate to
f'olk theatre. He felt that realism was intruding into the pre-dominantly folk theme. He
felt that the narrative levels were disconnected and tnat even without the chorus and the
two narrators the play would not have suﬁ'l
ered any loss of effect.

Mr. Prasanna denied the presense of
naturalistic elements in the play but also
clariﬁed that he was not f’olk performer but
a contemporary artiste. He saw no reason
for pure f'olk forms and said as a modern
artiste he had his own questions to ask and
seek answers for. His attempt had been to
ﬁnd the technical know how for narrative,

which tradition does not offer.
Speaking about the production the director, Mr. Prasanna, said his intention has been
to go beyond the modernist tradition in
Karnataka, and to takle the narrative f'orm on
stage. He referred to the assumption that a
play need not tell a story and spoke of his
own attempt as being a step beyond that, towards the presentation of a folk tale where
the emphasis is on words and the narrative
works on several levels. As in jogirata the

going in and out of it. At the same time
there would be no stage technique which
would make the stage immobile.

Mr. H' S. Krishnamurthy (Karnataka)
objected to the fact that Mr. Vasudevan Pillai
was trying to ﬁx the quality of good theatre
and not letting it develop.

Mr. Manavendranath (Kerala) and others
said the language of theatre ought to be able to
communicate despite the barriers of language.
Such a possibllity was dismissed by Prasanna.

Mr. Rarndas (Udupi) said play

used

three types of language, colloquial, poetic and
bookish and that this made for lack of coherence. He pointed out that there were similarities to Hamlet and Macbeth. Mr. Prasanna said Hamlet was also based on a folk
