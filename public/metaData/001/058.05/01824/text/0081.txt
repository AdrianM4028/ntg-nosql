our idea of an ending but ends when it pleases and begins all over again.

Company the closing session was held in
which the following moderators expressed

their views and suggestions:
Mr. K. N. Panikkar:
We are all searching for our own iden-

tity which cannot be limited to a particular
art form or to a distinct region. It depends
on the Director’s creativity in using the theatre as a medium of expression. It is a well
established fact that drama is something to

tion comes to him. The energy that is emanated in our folk forms gives ample scope for
the director. In my experience, I am not trying to superﬁcially transplant any of the folk
forms in my contemporary theatre, but to
embibe the strength of the tradition and allow
it to remain with me for some time and to
recreate the same for my self-expression. I

For this,

he has to discover the sub-text of the play
or the ‘thani Padha’ which will not be
there in the written text in so many words.

So he has to look beyond the lines written

by the playwright. In this way alone the
director will be able to get images to evolve
his own structure of the play. This is the
most basic work of the director to communicate with his audience and here we ﬁnd the

signiﬁcance and the necessity of the ‘f'orm’
or ‘roopa’.
