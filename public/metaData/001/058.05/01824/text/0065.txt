Music is the very soul and dynamics of
Nautanki theatre. It determines its pace and
tempo.
It is the musical structure which
sustains the performances structure and is the
source of the theatricality of Nautanki. The
musical structure is so perfect that when a
traditional sixohour performance is abridged
to two hours for city audiences, it gets dis—
turbed as it is based on a systematic order of
the ragas chosen to suit different hours ofthe
night. The naqqara with its great musical
potentialities builds up and sustains the rhythemic structure, by both following and
repeating the verbal lines and phrases sung
and recited by the actors.

Nautanki, as an operatic form with its
musical content of great range and theatricality, its simple, environmental staging
methods and its great hold on music-loving
mass theatre audiences, can play an important role in this phase of our contemporary
theatre, when theatre artistes are constantly
searching new links with the theatrical heritage. If theatre artistes succeed in ﬁnding
and sustaining these links, there may evolve
a modern form of operatic drama capable of
reﬂecting to-day‘s social realities, and thus
in resolving the paradox of the Hindi
