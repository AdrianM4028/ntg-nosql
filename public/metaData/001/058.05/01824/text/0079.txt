Mr. Gopalakrishna (Tamilnadu) said it
was an undramatic presentation of a drama—
tic event. He said the pre-Nirvana period
in Buddha’s life was more dramatic than the
post-Nirvana period. Mr. Thomas said the
events shown on stage were not transforming
Siddhartha but only adding to his decision.
Mr. Muthusvvamy (Tamilnadu) said the
pre-Nirvana period was; one of turmoil, full
of conﬂicts, volcanic.

‘HULIYA NERALU’
Janapada Repertory Group, Bangalore

Contemporary Kannada Theatre has two
decades of background in integrating f’olk
theatre techniques into modern playwriting.
The ﬁrst signiﬁcant play to come out of such
an attempt was Dr. Chandrasekhara Kambar’s, Jo Kumara Swamy (1970). Girish

Karnad’s Hayavadana being another important example of such an attempt.

The movement in the play is basicallycircular, like in most f'olk performances. Thecore of the circle is also the core of the
action, an 8’ X 8’ platform kept at the centre
lifts up the central action. The rest of the
play whirls round it in mounting circle.

The narrative style used here gives the play
