The South Zone Theatre Festival started
on Saturday with an oppropriate play symbolising the fusion of regional, national and
international dramatic elements. The play
directed by M. Ramaswarny and produced by
Real Theatre Movement, Thanjavur, was in

Tamil, a South Indian language, and adapted
from ‘Antigone’, the famous greek tragedy

of Sophocles and made use of Tamil folk
elements.

Mrs. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya, former President of the Central Sangeet Natak

Akademi inaugurating the festival at Kailash
Kalakshetra, expressed concern over the re-

cent tendencies ofsectarianism in the country.
She emphasised that theatre could be the
most effective medium to stop this and unify
various sections of the people.

‘We are

doing what even the British did not do —-—to
break up into sectarian groups. We can
prevent this again by our theatre’, she said.
The south zone theatre festival was in that
direction, she pointed out.

Eminent Kannada playwright, Mr. Adya
Rangacharaya, presiding over the inauguration, called upon akadernis to such theatre

festival to rural areas also. He said he was
reconsidering his earlier views on the need
for cash assistance to theatre groups. “There

is cash now but theatre does not seem to beneﬁt only from that. It is not enough to
provide cash assistance to groups and make
them perform before theatre enthusiasts.
Theatre groups must strive to create new
theatre lovers, and work in the direction. And

programmes should be reorganised with this
perspective”, Mr. Adya Rangacharya said.
