Theatre, ofany people and period, carries
forward its traditions constantly reshaping
and revitalizing them. Theatre is as much a
product of social conditions and forces as
their reﬂection. But theatrical history is also
full of contradictions and paradoxes. A paradox of the modern theatre of the Hindi

such a rich and strong tradition of operatic
theatre in the form of Nautanki, Bhagat, Swang or Sang, Maach, Khyal and Bidesia and

the Rasaleela and the stage-Ramaleelas, so
rich in poetic and musical content. The sense
of surprise at this paradox becomes much
greater when one finds that even music was
exiled from the theatre in vogue of realistic
theatre.

Fortunately, the realistic theatre, an

alien phenomenon in Indian thearical tradition, the result of the colonial situation, had
a short life and died a sudden and natural
death.

Kerala, Ratan Thiyam and Kanhailal of Manipur, B. V. Karanth and Bansi Kaul, and
several younger directors that one can see the
glimpses of the great Natyashastra tradition
in a new incarnation.

It is in this context of the most creative
and powerful encounter with the traditional
theatre that the Sangeet Natak Akademi has
