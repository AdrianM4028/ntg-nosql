other rasas and silences all of the rest.

Mr. Natarajan (Kerala) said Shanti rasa
is what is evoked in audience, not what can

Snehadoothan presents the story of prince
Sidharatha’s forays into the world outside
the palace, his slow but determined progress
towards the ﬁnal decision and the tranformation into Buddha, the Enlightened One, who

returns to the world bearing the message af
love. The play makes use of a mixture of
ancient Indian music, art and dramaturgy.
The action takes place in a highly stylised
form with dance steps of varied intensity
replacing normal movement and many songs
interrupting the action.

Mr. B. V. Karanth moderated the discussion on the play on January 11, 1984.
The director, Mr. C. K. Thomas, said

be presented on stage.

He said Bharatna-

tyam was not used to convey anything and
that it was use badly. He objected to the
fact that nothing derived from the Kerala
tradition was used, only Bharatnatyam,
Karnatic music and the cave paintings of
Ajanta. Mr. Thomas said it was not his intention to present Bharatnatyam but only to use
movements for various forms to suit the need

of the play.

Mr. Ramdas (Udupi) said there was
nothing from Kerala in the play. He said
the beauty of the human body was well ex-

ploited but that while all the other plays had
used the folk elements of their regions, Mr.
Thomas had not done so.

the play was not just selected for the festival.
He said he was trying to explore other indigenous f'orms than koodiyattam, therukoothu,

It was clariﬁed by Dr. Bhargava that the
festival is not only of folk but traditional

etc., that he wanted to take classical forms

theatre, classical or f'olk. Mr. Thomas expla-

which reﬂect the culture of their period.
None of these forms were used as they are
but were blended into the total structure.
The Gupta period was rich in every thing.

The idea was to present the whole play in
the dominant mood of Shanti rasa and to
make the audience not just observe but into

68

ined the use of the classical system of acting,
where the release of energy is predetermined.

To the question concerning folk and
modern drama, Mr. Thomas said there was

not one image of modern drama that one
could use.
