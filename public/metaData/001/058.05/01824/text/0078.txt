Mr. Narayana Pillai said the element of
traditional theatre has not been used to bring
out the conﬂict inherent in the theme. Mr.
Natarajan said the dynamism in the play
came only after the conﬂicts had been resolved and not before. Mr. Prabir Guha (West
Bengal) wanted to know why there was the
harking back to tradition, and whether its
sole compete with cinema and being neither
theatre nor cinema. The stylised presentation
did not put any message across and only
blocked any message there could have been,

becoming a gimmick. Mr. Thomas said he
found it “okay” in the context to use the

tion existed in Kathakali also and that very
few people in any audience understand a
play. He admitted that the play may not be
ﬁt for presentation to a huge crowd.
Mr. Narayana Pillai insisted that the
director had not succeeded in eliminating
jerks. Mr. Thomas said there were momentary jerks but they were subdued. Big jerks
were avoided.

Mr. Thomas said he did not think there
was a difference in Buddha’s personality before and after the enlightenment. He was
always logical, clear, honest, unselﬁsh.

ﬁlm choreography.

Mr. Guha had no argu-

ment about the dialogue but the lack of cornmunication in the entire thing.

Mr. Vasudevan Pillai (Kerala) felt poetry
was the basis of drama. He said every art
should have the quality of privacy, closeness.
The play reﬂected Siddharatha’s inability to
explain, his attempt to ﬁnd a language for
his soul.

Except certain ﬂaws, he said the

Mr. Ramadas repeated the objection
about the avoidance of dramatic elements.
Mr. Thomas said Buddha’s conﬂicts were not
spasmodic events but were always there in
him. He said the ﬁnal transformation was
the most important element and he did not
want drama to dominate over the transformation.

play made him happy.

Mr. R. Raju (Tamilnadu) said though
the director seemed to have one suﬂicient
research, he had failed to teach the common

man through the production. He felt that
even intellectuals would ﬁnd it diﬂicult to
understand and wondered whether the play
was meant, only for highbrow audiences.

Mr. Thomas observed that there certainly

Mr. Thomas said

Mr. Guha asked if Mr. Thomas had any
ideology, whether he thought the message and
life of Buddha were relevant to our time. He

felt that such transformations were only utopian longings.

Mr. Thomas said such lives may not be
taken wholly, they can only inﬂuence you.
He also felt that the purpose of drama was
more than communicating a message.

Mr. Narayana Pillai said it was not sufﬁ—
cient to show the events and that what Siddhartha was suppressing had to be made clear,

the inner conﬂict should have been brought
out. Mr. Thomas said Siddhartha’s feelings
were complex and deep that they would be
diﬂicult to communicate.
