DIRECTOR’S NOTE
The production is non—realistic. That is the only generalized label available
for this. The endeavour is to fuse the alienation technique of Brecht, the
chorus as is used in Greek drama, the physical theatre and body language
of the lndian classical theatrics.

The Play is episodic in structure and the scenes change with 5०ष्ठ3८८ड्डा५ and

dance. Part of the story telling is done by the chorus. The chorus also interacts
with the Hero and advises the hero. The locales and the background are
denoted by the painted scenery and supplemented by the chorus. In

addition to being a static scenery, the chorus moves and contributes to the
composition of the moving picture of ’he Play. To lace these episodes
together the mythological character Narada is used and he ir‘itenacts with
the chorus and he re, The character will have lot of potential in the finalized
version of the Play. The dance sequences of chorus Will be simple and the
Madras and gesrures can be easily identified and easily communicated. The

blend is novel and has great potential.
