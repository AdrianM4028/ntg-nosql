YEDHU - A newly formed group for young creative people.
The aim of the principals of this Group is to be militant
and uncompromising in their aesthetic pursuits in a complex
unbending and hostile social predicament. To generate a
new energy by drawing inspiration from traditional arts &
crafts and thought processes. This group would try in
future to get together people from various fields for creative
contributions.
