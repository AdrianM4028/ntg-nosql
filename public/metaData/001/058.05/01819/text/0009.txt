sentiment “Shakuntala” her innocence is a symbol of
y‘prakriti” nature. I noticed an exploitation of rprakriti’ by
-’urusha (Dushyanta). 1 found this is more relevent point,
than the sentiment.

Secondly, a major interpretation in ‘Shakuntala’ drama
is of Dushyantas’ son, a legal heir. Struggling for the
attainment of this heirship and various techniques used are
more significant.
I am presenting this show with the contemporary
relevence using the “desire of being a heir” as the major
string of this drama .
