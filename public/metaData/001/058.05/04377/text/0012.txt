Synopsis
Seeta Swayamvara opens with Mangalacharan, the prayer sung by the
Sutradhara, and is followed by a few preliminary scenes. Then the actual
story begins.
Vishwarnitra arrives at Dasharatha’s house to take away Rama and
La ksh ma na to protect his ashram from fierce demons. The story then
follows its usual course: Rama and Lakshmana’s triumph over the
demons, the news of Seeta’s marriage, the journey to Janaka’s house, the
release of Ahilya, and ﬁnally Seeta’s marriage.
