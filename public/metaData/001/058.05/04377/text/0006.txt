Synopsis
Nautanki is a popular form of folk theatre performed widely in Uttar
Pradesh and parts of its neighbouring States to its west. The dramatic
structure is simple and it uses versified dialogues that enrich both the
poetic and musical content of the play. Music is the very soul of Nautanki
theatre. The naqqara is used for accompaniment.
Shahanshah Jahangir rejects the appeal of Queen Noorjahan to
pardon Mangal Singh who had killed Ranjit Singh and injured his father
Uday Singh as they were opposed to his love of their daughter Kunwar.
In another incident, Queen Noorjahan kills the husband of a
washerwoman by accident and the matter goes to the court of law. As
King Jahangir ﬁrmly believes in tit for tat, he asks the washerwoman to kill
the husband of the queen (i .e, the King himself) in the same way as
Noorjahan had killed the washerwoman’s husband. Hearing this, the
washerwoman forgives them and then Mangal Singh and Kunwar happily
get married.
