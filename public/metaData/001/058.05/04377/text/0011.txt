characters, and dialogue. It is not divided into acts like conventional

Gadhvache Lag/7a means ‘Marriage of an Ass’. The central character
of the story is Chitrasen Gandharva. In the course of the dance of Rarnbha
in the court of Indra — the king of Gods — Chitrasen is captivated by the
beauty of Rarnbha and holds her hand. Enraged by this, Indra curses
Chitrasen to live as an ass on earth. At the request of Brihaspati — the
guru of the Gods — to forgive Chitrasen, Indra declares he will free him
from the curse only when Chitrasen gets married to Satyabati, princess of
Mithula. The condemned ass (Chitrasen) has superhuman powers and
succeeds in fulfilling the condition of marrying Satyabati. According to the
agreement, the king is forced to marry his daughter with the ass and then
Chitrasen is freed of his curse.
