Natyotsav
Sangeet Natak Akademi, The National Academy of Music, Dance and Drama
New Delhi is glad to present a weeklong festival of traditional and
contemporary theatre in Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh. The
festival is focussed on young practitioners of theatre from different parts of
the country. The Akademi under its various schemes is supporting
experimental and innovative works by young theatre workers and the present
event is part of a series of festivals, workshops, interaction programmes,
etc., organised in different cities of the country during the year.

Natyotsav will bring to the theatre lovers of Hyderabad contemporary plays
in Marathi, Punjabi, Assamese and Hindi by some of the talented young
directors. Among the traditional forms of theatre Kutiyattarn of Kerala,
Tamasha of Maharashtra and Nautanki of Uttar Pradesh will be featured.

An event of this nature can be successfully organised only with the participation
and support of the State Government as well as other agencies and individuals
committed to the preservation and promotion of theatre. We are glad that
the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh has extended its
collaboration by hosting the festival in Rabindra Bharati Auditorium,
Hyderabad.
We hope the rasikas of Hyderabad will enjoy the performances presented in
Natyotsav.
