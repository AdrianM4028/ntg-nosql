Imaginative, and efficient man, Lachit, his general, or Borphukan, to free
Assam from the Mughals and win back her lost glory. Lachit Borphukan
started his campaign and was victorious. The enemy general, Ram Singh,
was all praise for Lachit and the Ahom forces at the great battle of
Saraighat. Lachit was bold, honest and enterprising and knew the
