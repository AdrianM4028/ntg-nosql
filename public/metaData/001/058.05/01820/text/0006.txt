SYNOPSIS ' :
This play is based on a popular folk-art form ‘Gangir'eddata’, in
Andhra Pradesh. Gantanna, (Bull-man) Booranna, (Sehanai-man) and
Dolanna (Dholak-man) entertain people by displaying to them the feats
by a decorated bull.
While performing the feat of standing on the stool (with all his four
legs) B asav anna (the decorated Bull) falls from the stool. Then the bull

tells in human voice, why he fell down.

B asav anna relates the real life stories frequently going on in the
society, like the gruesome consequences of dowry system, the misdeeds
on pseudosaints, and the political vandalism etc. ,
B asavanna despite his animal hood astonishingly gaining speech
and speaking out loudly at witnessing these gruesome happenings is
appaled at mankind’s dumbness. He calls shame on mankind for chosing
to be silent and passive despite being gifted with ability to speak, think
and act. B asavanna exhorts human beings to shake off their fear ﬁlled
indifference and to "unitedly gather themselves to set—right the prevalent
disorders in the society.
