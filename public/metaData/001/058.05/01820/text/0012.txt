On his way Horse meets a Horsie from the country. Both of them fall
in love. After sometime he takes leave ofher promising to meet her again
on completion of his mission.
Bull and his counsellors refuse to pay the tributes as ordered by the
Lion. They are prepared to ﬁght and die rather than surrendering their
honour to the wishes of the Lion.

A war is declared and the battle begins. Both sides declare cease-ﬁre
for their afternoon lunch. They settle on their respective camps. Serving
starts. Some demand vegetarian and others demand non-veg on both the
camps. The demand goes on becoming louder and louder. A new division
takes place. All the vegetarians and non vegetarians from both sides

group themselves on opposite sides. In this process Horse and Horsie
happily join hands.
