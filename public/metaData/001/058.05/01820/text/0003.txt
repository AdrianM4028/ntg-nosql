SYNOPSIS :
The story of this play unr'olls by ‘Chakyar’, who serves as the
narrator and also appears as some characters through ‘Pakarnnattam’.
Chakyar is like ‘Suthradaran’, of ‘Koodiyattarn’, or ‘Koothu’, the
ancient theatre forms of Kerala.

King Aditya Vanna is a benevolent ruler. One day Valiya Vazhathoppil, Potti, a famous Brahmin astrologer and a childhood companion of the
King visits him and foretells that the King would die exactly on the 93rd
day, following his (Brahmin) death.
Days pass by. One day the King learns that the Brahmin is dead and
the prophecy starts hunting him like death itself. Fear struck, he becomes
sick. A woman who comes to nurse him takes advantage of this and robs
him so completely that he is left naked. As such, considered deranged the
King is locked up in a room.

Aditya Vanna somehow escapes. Wandering through the countryside he seeks a ‘Divine Mantra’, to escape death but in vain. Disappointed he returns to his Kingdom but only to ﬁnd that he is no more
recognised as the King.

Finding no other go, the King starts on a pursuit of worldly pleasure.
But there also he fails. At long last a woman by name 'I‘hathri takes to him
kindly, comforts him and gives him some solace. Perplexed by the
happenings, when the King is in a trance state, Chakyar appears in the
role of Brahmin and bestows upon the King a peaceful death.

On the announcement of the King’s death, the prince is coronated.
