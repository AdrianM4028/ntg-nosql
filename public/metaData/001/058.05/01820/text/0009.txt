Siddanayaka rnobilises the poor against Desai. The pontiff Gut
ruvaiah quite Unexpectedly helps him out with gun power. Omkari an
idealistic dreamer of social equality but deemed a half wit by the villagers
also joins him.
Desai is killed in a rebellion. The poor get the grains from Desai’s
storage and Chenni is released. A village council is set up to facilitate just
distribution of the land to the tenants. In another development Urininga
refuses to take Chenni back as his wife as she was spoiled by Desai.

Greed of the land overcomes the council members. Only Siddanayaka and Urininga stand committed to the cause. But the schemy Guruvaiah hatches conspiracy and traps both Siddanayaka and Urininga.
Siddanayaka, utterly disgusted at the developments and unable to resolve
the misunderstanding created between him and Urininga, succumbs to
the pressure of Guruvaiah, to end up as another Desai himself.
