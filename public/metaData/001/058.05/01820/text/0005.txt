DIRECTOR’S NOTE
The motif behind the "production of this play is not to tell an
imaginary story, but to project the agonies of human life in the face of
death. Apart from highlighting the mess and miseries that man has made
of politics, beliefs, love, passion, etc an attempt is made to go through the
mysterious cycle oftirne and the wish to survive the sufferings oflife and
thereby to grapple with the question of immortality.

Kerala’s traditional folk arts and music is used to enrich the
production. The beauties of Kerala ’ s temple sculpture and cult, paintings
of Raj a Ravi Verrna etc have their inﬂuence on the colour pattern of the
total play.
