DIRECTOR’S NOTE
The play has a deceptively simple story. Working on the age old
- tradition of narrating a fable, the play lends itself to multiple interpretations. The animal characters are brought in here as purveyors of different
View points prevalent in today’s human World.

The production is based on the traditional form ‘Koothu’, of the
Tamils. Tunes and rhythms form the style of the play. Nonetheless, developments of modern theatrical knowledge have also been imbibed. All
this is aimed at being traditional with a modern impact.
The possibilities of avenue stage are explored here. As a result it has
given an opportunity to accommodate various forms of stages like End,

Thrust and Round Stage.

'

The choice of the stage is prompted by the internal structure of the
script itself. It is found to be resourceful to highlight the polarities and
direct encounters. The ‘Space’, has necessitated mobile musicians as
well.

The battle scene is inspired by the ‘Sura Samharam’.
