have been brought to the stage through Sponsorships offered
by the Akademi. A number’of productions first staged in the

The present festival’features four new productions in
Marathi, Gujarati and Urdu. These have been chosen by an

proposals from the western states of the country. We hope
the audience enjoys these plays over the four days of the
festival.
