NATYA SAMAROH ’86
Nagpur
Natya Samaroh is the product of SNA’s Scheme for
Assistance to Young Theatre Workers, now in its third
year of operation. The scheme was launched to
support the efforts of young directors in quest of an
indigenous theatre idiom, inspired by the
traditional/folk theatre of the country. The scheme is
operated on the basis of a State-wise division of the
country into four zones. Selected directors and groups
are offered substantial financial assistance to cover the
cost of the productions staged in the Zonal Festivals.
Selections from the four Zonal Festivals feature in the
National Theatre Festival in Delhi
In the course of the past two years eleven zonal
festivals have been held — in Bangalore, Cochin,
Mysore (South Zone), Bhubaneswar, Calcutta,
Guwahati (East Zone), Lucknow, Chandigarh,
Kurukshetra (North Zone), Goa and Udaipur (West
Zone). The present festival at Nagpur is the last of the

Zonal Festivals this year.
