ARERE SANSAR SANSAR

(in Marathi)
_
Produced by: Indian National Theatre, Bombay
Written by: Suresh Chikle
Directed by: Bharat Tandel

Synopsis
The play is based on a travelogue of the Varkari Sampradaya, a
religious order of Maharashtra, whose members go to Pandarpura
on foot to attend the Festival of Vithala. On the way they make
halts in wayside villages. Wherever they stay, they perform Bhajan
and Songi Bharud for the entertainment of the villagers. The
playwright has made an effort to show that the different folk forms
of Maharashtra can be effectively used for contemporary situations
in theatre.

Director’s Note
The Varkari Sampradaya tradition of Maharashtra dates from an
early period. The Sampradaya has two main song forms Vithalpanthi Bhajan and Songi Bharud. The production is chieﬂy based
on these. The play starts with Rupacha Abhang.
