PRESS AND BAWA JITTO
Leaving aside for a moment his experiment with folk and traditional forms,
one would like to compliment the director Balwant Thakur for his ingenious use
of space in mounting the action, his innovative movements, grouping and his
imaginative use of actors to express aesthetic visual effects as sprouting of
the leaves and waving of crops. One welcomes young Balwant Thakur as a
promising theatre talent.

-THE STATESMAN, JAN. 18, 1987
The legend of 'Bawa Jitto', a 15th century folk tale sung in balled form in
the hilly region of Jammu was creatively interpreted by Director Balwant Thakur.
Amongst the many evocative compositions the most rivetting was the sequence
where Jitto battles the forces of nature to convert a wild rocky space into the most
fertile plot of land.
-THE HINDUSTAN TIMES, JAN. 19,1987
Natrang of Jammu in its production of Baba Jitto largely depends upon 'Karkan'.
To provide variety, the Director Balwant Thakur introduces different elements of some
other folk forms like Hem, Kud, Sauian and Geetru etc.
-THE TIMES OF INDIA, JAN 19,1987
The Director has creatively used human body to express various situations
and locales. At places these acquired the form of visual poetry impairing intensity
to the production.
-INDIAN EXPRESS, NEW DELHI JAN. 18, 1987
The most noteworthy feature of the presentation was the employment of three
authentic folk singers who constituted the chorus and sustained the play on wings
of poesy. The other devices used were expressionism the theatre of action, the
language of gesture and silence and the ritual dances. Director Balwant Thakur
deserves compliments for a slick production.
