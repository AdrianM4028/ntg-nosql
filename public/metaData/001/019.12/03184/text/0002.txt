SYNOPSIS:
The play Bawa Jitto is based on 15th Century Folk tale. A poor peasant, Jitto,
flees his village to escape harassment and exploitation by his relatives. Along with
his nine—year—old daughter, he takes refuge in the house of a friend in Shamachak,
a nearby village. Bawa Jitto succeeds in getting a piece of land from a local landlord
through the efforts of his friend. The landlord allows him to cultivate the land on the
condition of getting one—third of the total produce.
With hardwork, J itto makes the barren land bloom . On seeing the rich crop, the
landlord becomes greedy and plans to take home the whole of the produce. His
musclemen come to plunder the crop. But the helpless Jitto kills himself with a dagger,
sitting on his stacks of wheat. The musclemen carry away the crop drenched in blood.
The young daughter of Jitto irnmolates herself by jumping on her father's pyre.

First performance of the play at Kurukshetra.
