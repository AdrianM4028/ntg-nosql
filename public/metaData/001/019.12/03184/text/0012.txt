the oppressor. This was the basic idea of ' Bawa Jitto' in Dogri
presented under
the direction of Balwant Thakur.

-WEEKEND REVIEW, 8—14 FEB, 1987

'Bawa J itto' another experiment in which with a view to creating modern theatre
idiom, director Balwant Thakur has yoked physical theatre into the services of folk
elements, singing and rnirning of 'Soyian' with a Karkan style of presentation. The
resultant work earned top honours last year in this zone's Festival organized by
S an ge e t N ata k A k a d e m i .

-THE TRIBUNE, 23 FEB, 1987
Balwant Thakur has made wonderful use of all folk forms, remains equally

careful not to lose contemporary touch. He has made the rustic folk form even more
plausible and acceptable for urban audience. Full justice has been done to the legend
of Dogra peasant hero. An appropriate homage to 'Bawa Jitt‘o'
-VED PAL DEEP, KASHMIR TIMES 23 DEC 1987

While Balwant has made liberal and forceful use of the folk elements like
Kud and Geetru dances, his magnum opus is the 'physical theatre' in which he
employs his boys and girls as trees and branches, swaying crops which has been
hailed as sheer poetry. His colleagues speak of him as a hard taskrnaster who doesn't
neglect even the min utest detail and extracts the very best from his cast. Moreover
he has a highly innovative mind which irnbues his plays with welcome features.

-SURAJ SARAF, SUNDAY HERALD, JULY 17, 1988
For Bhopalites to see this play 'Bawa Jitto' was a unique experience. Wrestling
by jojan's sons shown in the play is a novel thing to the theatre goers. The direction
of Balwant Thakur was excellent.
-MADHYA PRADESH CHRONICLE, FEB, 18,1992

In Bawa Jitto, Balwant has been specially lauded for using local performances
and body theatre in a highly innovative manner.
