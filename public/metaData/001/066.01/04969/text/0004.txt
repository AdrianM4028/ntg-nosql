Library resources and facilities available at
Sansthan include the largest collection of
contemporary documents centering around
Indian Theatre anywhere in the country. The
Sansthan's library offers representative selection
of play-scripts and theoretical, technical and
reference matter on theatre, along with a
collection of back issues of journals, including
several rare ones. Current issues of new
periodicals are also available here. The library has
over 6000 books and issues of over 200
periodicals, many ofthem being old and rare. The
Sansthan takes particular care to preserve the old
and the rare treasure in stock. While all modern
preservation measures are put to use, a large part
of the material has been microfilmed for easier
access and retrieval. Scholars and theatre
practitioners from all over the country, and abroad
too, use the Sansthan’s resources. A congenial
atmosphere and reader friendly staff help the
readers to find and select the material. The library
offers xeroxing facility to the readers.
