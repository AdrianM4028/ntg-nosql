Woyzeck is the first modern TragedymtrThe‘firs
wholly successful tragic representation of the common man
on the stage: a representation which shows him capable of

greatness of mind and soul and feeling, and the environment

that keeps him from realising these depths.
‘Woyzeck‘ is the precursor of the Naturalist
movemen .

As a drama of social criticism, Woyzeck has

never been, and very likely never will be, suSpended.

Its

power lies in the fact that its problems are, in addition
to being Specific, universal in time ठी place.
is

Yet more

required of a great work than that it be a mere expose

of misery and social injustice.
‘Buechner‘s method in'Woyzeck‘andIDanton'is the same:

Juxtaposition of scenes —
scene

in the spic Theatre, each

is virtually autonomous, yet when assembled they

constitute a seemingly indissoluble whole.

Each scene

works with the others and comments implicitly upon them.
Thus we understand the reasons for Woyzeck‘s state of mind

and body, for his hallucinations; when we see him, literally
turned into a guineapig for the Doctor‘s scientific
observations and his injunction to eat ”nothing but peas",
or when we see the Captain incessantly prodding him about

his strangeness, and mocking at his inability to keep
Marie faithful to him. In short, Woyzeck, in order to
exist, must hand himself over as a guineapig to society.
A properly organized society would not give rise to

such a condition.

If Woyzeck is to live, then he must

do as he is forced to, by economic necessity.

Buechner

was one of the first to bring attention to the economic
factor in society.
