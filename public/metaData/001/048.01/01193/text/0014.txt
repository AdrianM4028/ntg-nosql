NATIONAL SCHOOL OF DRAMA

किं
K

The Repertory Company of the National School
of Drama was formed on an experimental basis

by Shri E. Alkazi, who played a major role in
nurturing and expanding the Company when
he was Director of the School (1962-77). In the
beginning, the Company consisted on only
four actors. It later expanded into a larger
group of actors, musicians and technicians,
mainly graduates of the School. Initially, in
1964, the late Om Shivpuri led the Company
and later in 1977, Shri Manohar Singh was
appointed the first Chief of the Compnay. Over
the years the Repertory has produced a variety
of plays ranging from stylised musicals to
realistic contemporary works of Indian drama
to translations and adaptations of foreign
language plays.
