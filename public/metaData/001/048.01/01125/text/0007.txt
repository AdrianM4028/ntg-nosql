Although farce had long been a popular tradition in France, it
was scorned by the literates during the early 17th century and relegated to public fairs. Only the improvised cornrnedia dell‘artre remained in favour, and in it Moliere found the hasis of his new comedy.

Incorporating the cornrnediae rudita, which was written than improvised, and the classic Roman comedy, he had seen in his school days,
he gradually shaped the future devel0pment of French comedy.

Moliere broke with the traditional five act form, often using only one
act or three, and freed drama of many of the classical restraints.
Actors began to Speak on stage as they did in life; repartee replaced
long speeches, His great character studies-the pedant, the rniser,
the bluestocking, the moral purist, the social climber, the religious

hypocrite-are not stock characters, but realistically drawn creations
whose prototypes could be seen in contemporary society.
The Rogueries of Scapin (Les fourberies de Scapin, 1671) is a
farcical comedy based on the ‘Phormio' of Terence. The play has
a complicated plot in the style of Moliere’s early forces. but is
imbued with the shrewd and observant realism characteristic of
his later plays.
