summoned to Parma, where he composed a comic opera for
Duke Philip and was made court poet at an annual stipend of
3,000 lire. In 1758 he went to Rome to work with the
Tordinone Theatre, but the all male cast was poor and the
venture was a fiasco. Goldoni returned to Venice.
By 1761 , when Carlo Gozzi’s first fantasy was presented, the
Venetians had begun to tire of Goldoni’s realistic comedy.
Goldoni, weary of the struggle, accepted an offer from the
Comedie-ltalienne in Paris. His last play in Venice, One of the
Last Nights of the Carnival (Una delle Ultime sere di carnovale),

produced on February 16, 1762, was a loving and joyous
farewell to the city.
Goldoni emerged from his retirement as a playwright with The
Beneficient Bear (Le bourru bienfaisant), performed by the
Comedie-Francaise in 1771. This was his last successful
comedy. In 1770 he had relinquished his tutor’s post to his
nephew and retired with his royal pension. He moved to Paris
to write his Memories and spent his last years in easy conviviality
with his host of friends. Generous even in adversity, Goldoni
twice translated works to aid friends in financial difficulties. 4
