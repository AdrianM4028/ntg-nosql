Goldoni, Carlo
(1707-1793)
Italian dramatist Goldoni was born in Venice on February 25,

1707, into a middle-class family with a passionate interest in
the theatre. The doting parents watched their precocious child
begin to read, write, and stage little puppet performances by
the time he was four. The poor health of Goldoniâ€™s mother
forced the family to move to Chioggia in 1720, and
consequently the boy was transferred to a Dorninical school in
Rimini. But Roman comedies proved more appealing to him
than philiosophy, and a travelling theatrical troupe more
interesting than his tutors. When the company left Rimini in
1721, Carlo went with them as a stowaway, spending three
joyous days at sea before returning, scarcely penitent, to

Chioggia .
