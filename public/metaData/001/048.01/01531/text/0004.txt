A year later, through family influence, Goldoni obtained a
scholarship at Chisheri College in Pavia. There he read the
classical comic dramatists and carefully studied the French
theatre, especially the plays of Moliere. To his rnortification he
learned that there was no Italian equivalent and vowed to see
his country “rise to the level of the others.”
In Pavia, Goldoni learned fencing, dancing, music, drawing,
“all possible games of commerce and chance, ” and the technique

of writing couplets and songs “not displeasing to the ladies”. In
1725, after composing a satire that ridiculed the young ladies
of Pavia’s finest families, Goldoni was expelled from the
college.
Resuming his studies at Modena in 1726, Goldoni fell under the
spell of an aging religious fanatic and was about to become a
monk when his father again intervened; administered a heavy
draft of Venetian theatre; and returned with him to Chioggia.
In January, 1728, Goldoni became the coadjutor’s assistant,

a post he discharged so well that the chancellor employed him
as coadjutor in May, 1 729, when he moved to Feltre . However,

his official duties in no way hampered his revels. He soon
became reacquainted with an actor from his stowaway clays
and rersurned a relationship with his “first love”, a lady he later
abandoned because he fearerd’ “she might not age well. ”
where his father, mortally ill, summoned his strength to
introduce him into society; and take him to the theatre in
Faenza before suffering a fatal relapse.

The following year Goldoni entered the University of Padua to
complete his legal studies. He then returned to Venice and
because of clerical error was admitted to the bar after only
eight months of the required two-year apprentice—ship. A
dearth of clients gave him time to write an almanac and a
musical drama.
