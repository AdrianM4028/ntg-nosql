Spirit of young talent

F EBRUARY does not make
one shiver; on the contrary it has
the warmth of cold with some
‘parting kicks’. Culture-lovers of
Capital can savour this ‘warmth’
during a 20-day 7th Yuva Mahot-

sava, the grand youth festival
organised by Sahitya Kala
Parishad (SKP) beginning from
February 7 at College of Arts.
The ‘Mahotsava’ which began in
1985 offers a veritable fare of
music. dance, drama, ﬁne arts
and choir singing by Capital’s up
and coming youngsters.
The year 1985 was observed as
the ‘International Year of
Youth’ and the SKP organised
its ﬁrst youth festival to synchronise with it. And this spirit of
‘Year of Youth” has come to stay
and has become an annual feature of SKP’s programmes. “We
have rnaestros performing for
us. But promoting the young talents is our main aim and for this
Mahotsava is a very special occasion for us,” declares SKP
secretary Surendra Mathur. It is

special invitee.
The ﬁne arts section will have
different institutions and also individuals in various galleries.
There will be a children’s corner
also where artistes will teach
them the use of different media
in arts. There will be a special
gallery for cartoons and caricature and also an on-the-spot
painting competition for children .
SKP intends to emphasise on
inter-disciplinary approach to
bring about the harmony among
the various disciplines of arts,

both visual and performing. For
this camps are being set up for
interaction among the artistes
from different disciplines.
SKP would do well to hold dis—
cussions and seminars on this
occasion to discuss the stagnation that has crept into our arts.
The traditional gharana and
guru-shishya tradition is no longer holding its original roots and
seems to be on the verge of out—
living its usefulness. The young
generation cornered in cocoon
of gharanas finds it difﬁcult to
expressin terms of modern sen—
sibility. It is an urgent need to
make our traditional arts innova-

tive and ﬂowing so that our
youth can express the angst and
spirit of modern times. This will

require a thorough investigation
of the education system in arts
that has succeeded in other parts
of the world, especially in the
West.
