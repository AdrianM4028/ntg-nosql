i am glad to know that the Sahitya Kala Parishad is
holding the Yuva Mahotsava this year too, eighth time in succession
ever since its inception in

1985,

the international Year of the

Youth.
The event, which witnesses a veritable surge of creative
activity in the Capital in diverse fileds of performing and visual
arts. has not only come to stay, but has also become one of
the biggest yough events in the country. it provides every year
a common platform to hundreds 0! new young talents of different
disciplines to blossom into great artists.
It is no wonder, therefore,
acquired high and growing popularity

that the Mahotsava
amongst the people,

has
the

press and the youth.
1 wish the Mahotsava a grand success.
