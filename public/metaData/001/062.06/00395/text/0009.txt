AS I 'IHINK. 0F HINDUSTHAN SPORTS
& CULTURAL SOCIETY
To speak of cultural organisations,

Hindusthan

Society is just one of many in the Capital

with

Sports

and

Cultural

almost the same aims and

objects as of the others, but what makes it different is not only in its prOviding a common platform for the different cultures of the different communities but in the way it is making itself popular amongst all sections of the
people by organising different types of cultural activities within such a short

period of its existence since 1955.
It is a pleasure to note that this infant organisation has already staged
a classic drama-“BIJOYA”, with great success apart from presenting occa-

sionally variety programmes on BAISAKHI, HOLI and BUDDHA JAYAN'I‘I.

I wish this society greater success in the years to come as such organisations are all the more necessary in our everyday life troubled with so much of

stress and strain.
