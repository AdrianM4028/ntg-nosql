Jadav, whose feelings hardened with the streneous
Work he had to take up at that old age for a paltry sum
since the breaking up, was overwhelmed with grief on
hearing from Madhav of Bindu, for whom his heart always
ached, and set out for her house at the dead of night with
Annapurna and Amulya.

With the cOming of light of a new day a new life was
given to Bindu as Amulya jumped upon his “Choti-ma”
with hushed cries and that light continued to shine on the
re-united family for ever and ever.

7 Once an idea of a few youngsters and now
an organisation of some responsible members of
all the communities, - that’s how our Society
पृ came into being and that’s what it is to-day.
As a cultural body it has always been our
endeavour to bring on a common platform the
best of all the people without any discrimination and our future progrmmes will also be
guided to that end. We won’t quote newspaper comments in our favour but certain
instances cannot but hearten us. The award
won by our Society in the last Drama Festival
(1956-57) . of Delhi Natya Sangha by presenting the Bengali drama ‘KarAparadhe’ is a
milestone on our way. Behind that lies the
successful presentation Of a few more plays like

‘Bijoya’, Griha Prabesh’ etc and a number of
cultural programmes, some even with international participation.
Given the co-operation and goodwill of the
citizens of the Capital we hope to achieve our
aim of culturally binding the different sections
of the people with the same cord.
