For the last two consecutive years drama
festivals were arranged by the Madhya
Pradesh Government in the capital. This year
the last three plays presented in the week
long festival were modern Indian plays.
Mahanirwan, Hayavadana and Andhayug.
Directed by Alaknanadan, Mahanirvan casts
B V Karanth the director of this company, in
the lead role of a dead man watching his own
funeral proceedings. Delhi has seen Karanth
after a long time and it is indeed a pleasure
to witness his relaxed and Spontaneous

portrayal and hear his rich musical voice.
Noor Zaheer, LINK, DECEMBER, 11, 1983.
The werk done from Bharat Bhawan - in just
two years since its birth in early 1982 is a
glowing testimony to what can be achieved
when the political, administrative and artistic
will comes together.

The Madhya Pradesh Rang Mandal's focus,
for the first time in post-Independent India,
on the importance of language and local

character in theater, is correctly described as
a historical phenomena for Hindi theatre and
Hindi language.
