ABOUT TH E P LAY
Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib, the great earstwhile Urdu poet, decides
to visit his beloved 'Delhi' on the occasion of his 200th birth anniversary
to witness his posthumous fame, something that was quite elusive in
his lifetime. The entire plot revolves around Ghalib, striving against an

ornnipotent identity crisis, beginning with the occupants of his Haveli
rnisconstructing him as Ghalib's "Jinn“. This forces him to stay with

a Bihari boy, Jaihind, a Delhi University student, in a servant quarter
in Laxmi Nagar. His confidence is shatered when Jaihind and Mrs.
chaddha, Ghalib's land lady, recognise his worth only through the
voice of Jagjit Singh and the screen portrayal of Naseeruddin Shah.
Persuaded by Jaihind and Mrs. Chaddha, Ghalib, in desperate need
of recognition, decides to 'sell' himself. The consequent press
conference turns out to be a damp squib, with the journalists being
more interested in post—conference snacks and juicy headlines. Ghalib,
then opts for an Advertising Agency to perpetuate his presence in the
minds of the people.
What is the fate of Ghalib ’? Does his rebirth spell further disaster? ls
Delhi a mere traversty of his hopes and aspirations? To find out more
about the play, come and enjoy "Ghalib in New Delhi", a rib tickling
comedy that poses serious questions on the stagnating prevalent
moral codes.
