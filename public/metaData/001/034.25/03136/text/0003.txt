P I E R ROT’ S T R O U P E
Named after the French Pantomime character, Pierrot, Pierrot’s Troupe
is the creative expression of the desire of a team of young people to
explore and unearth various facets of life in and around all of us. It,
thus, brings to the stage, at regular intervals, the palpable reality of life
with all its nuances.

Non-conformist yet rooted in the finest tradition of Indian theatre,
Pierrot’s Troupe has earned within a couple of years of its inception
the reputation of being the purveyor of original plays in Delhi.
In such, Pierrot’s plays are a welcome exception to excessive

adaptations of English plays and beating-the-bush—productions of Indian
classics.
More than 150 shows of topical and incisive productions of Pierrot’s

include those of Zindagi Naam Hai Jeya Jaane Ka, Tum Ko Chahoon
Ke Na Aao, Kaun Sunta Hai Kahani Meri, Padiye Gar Beemar, Magar
Phir Bhi, Cut... Cut... Cut..., Headline Hazir Ho, Ghalib in New Delhi,
Man of Letters, Kal Turnhari Baari Hai, Painter Di Hatti, lblees Ka Beta
Ishq Kar Batha, A Private Affair and Aastha.
