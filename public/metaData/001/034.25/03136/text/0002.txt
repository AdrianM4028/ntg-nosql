ABOUT T H E P LAY
Inspired by Hermann Hesse’s renowned novel, Gertrude, Aastha, is a
tale of people trying to come to terms with themselves, grappling with
the most fragile relationships. Every character in this play knows that he
is suffering but the reason for the plight he is in is quite unknown to him.
Those who undergo the process of self-realisation emerge victorious at

the end of it all. Devdutt, a cripple, but more so, a talented playwright
from Allahabad, comes to Bombay to join the theatre world. There, he
meets Albert, a top actor, who as an individual, is considered repulsive

by everybody. He also meets Aastha, a debutante actress, and promptly
falls in love with her. But, he soon discovers that Aastha is having an

affair with Albert. However, what follows is not regular triangular love
story, but a story of love, pain and passion that transcends the manwornan relationship and enters the realm of individual relationships.
Aastha and Albert succumb in their efforts to live a life devoid of pain. It
is Devdutt alone who manages to survive. How he manages to overcome
his inferiority of being a cripple and bear with great fortitude, the pain life
has inflicted on him forms the crux of Aastha.
