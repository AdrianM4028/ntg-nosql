Man is born of darkness but is irresitibly drawn
to light. This extends the hope that he will not fail,
inspite of the darkness in him.
Major

Narang

was

a

dashing.

brave,

and smart

Ofﬁcer. He rose to the highest expectations of his
wife Nirupma and Nirupma did see in him the hero
of her ideal concept.
But confronted with death
in NEFA,
Major
Nara/ng found his nature failed him most unexpectedly and grieviously. He choose to live rather
than die, and in the process to live, caused the
avoidable death of two of his officers.
This

exposed before his eyes, the dark, rotten and hateful
stuff he and man was made of. He lost faith in him
and man and all talk of the ideal and idealism
seemed to him the greatest of fraud played on man.
But life cannot stop at that and man cannot rest
content with the destiny of rats and bats. He has to
live with and upto an

image. even if it means his

death. And Major Narang, ultimately did live through
death.
In

the context of

a

particular situation, the play

attempts at exploration of human nature —its vitality

and its weakness; its radiant idealism and its dark
realism ; its awareness of its fallibility and its deadly
struggle to live through death.
Nirupma the idealist, though a being outside
Major Narang’s existence and outwardly ﬁghting
him, is in essense, Major Narang's own inner
existense, fighting the darkness in him and assailing
and asserting over the animal-fear of physical pain
and death.
