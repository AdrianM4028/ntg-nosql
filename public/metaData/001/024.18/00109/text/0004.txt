Deep Shikha
Religion is one thing which we do not chose. It is
forced on us by the incidence of our birth. Our faith in it
is not rational; seldom the result of intellectual evaluation;
always the product of our habitual acceptance of the religion

of our parents.

Yet religion has the ﬁnal say, even in

matters where destinies of human beings are involved.

The play concerns itself with Deepshikhawa

hindu

girl and Iqbal a rnuslim youth, who want to marry each
other. They disown that part of history and culture, which
forces them to face each other as sworn enemies. Religion
can allow their marriage only when they convert themselves
. to either of the two religions. But conversion is replacing
one irrational religion with another and simply shifting
loyalty from one belligerent camp to another. A way has
to be found to get out of this sickening situation.
All progressive nations are trying to evolve legislations
that can provide common seals for human relationships.
Those seals are national and an integrated modern Society
can be evolved only when these replace the seals of religions—«seals which carry with them the bitterness of
history and the allergies of culture.
