And. Manju IS happy

All mothers want their children
to be educated and honoured.

But not all parents can give their children
this chance in life. if their number is large.

You can educate your children better if you
limit your family to two or three.

Free advice and services to plan your
family are available at Family Welfare
Planning Centres which can be identified
by the sign of the Red Triangle.
