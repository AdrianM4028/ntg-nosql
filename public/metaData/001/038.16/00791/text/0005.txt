A NOTE ON THE PLAY
THE LITTLE CLAY CART ascribed to King Shudraka (4th century) has a wide
range of characters: a merchant, a courtesan, a masseur—tumed-monk, a
courtier, a thief, a blundering good-hearted friend, a lecherous brother-in-law
of the king, a judge, executioners, bastards, maid servants, cart drivers,
elephant tarners, crooks, gamblers. Nowhere in the entire ancient Hindu drama

"
do we find such individualized sinewy characters.
The play reveals the cross section of society and shows‘ the. seamy side of life
with a sense of mockery. Mischief, lust, greed, love, stupidity, iustice, cruelty,
and philosophy are intermixed. Tenderness is broken by sudden brutality,
milky lyricism by muddy speech, poignancy by banal laughter. Yet the play
maintains a sense of harmony, the essence of Hindu aesthetics.
This large-scale drama is divided into ten acts, each act running into many
scenes of action. To present this action-packed colorful narrative on a
proscenium stage with realistic decor will be against the very spirit of the Hindu
theatre which depends on the art of gesture-language and is a theatre of the
imagination.

In the present production I have endeavored to evoke the mood and meaning
by stirring the imagination. The Stage Manager and his Wife open the play—
a tradition of the classical Sanskrit drama and the folk theatre. The characters
speak to each other, to themselves, and to the audience revealing their Selves

from many angles. Music, exaggerated make-up, colors, and rhythms are used
to iniect poetry, drain off sentiment, and focus attention. Dances are not
merely embellishments, but serve a dramatic function almost as important as

a chorus. The drum by its thuds, clatters, and thumps gives point to the
stylized action. The circular passage, the aisles, and the round gallery are
stage areas engulfing the audience.
Working with American players has been an enjoyable experience. The
Theatre—the art of dissernbling, the science of playing the Other—made all of
us explore our Opposites. The American actors and actresses, during rehearsals, discovered in themselves ancient Hindu merchants and courtesans, while

I found a bit of American in me. During our work, we reversed the roles.
