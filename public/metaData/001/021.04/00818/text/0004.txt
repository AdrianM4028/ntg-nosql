Symbol of Achievement

‘Torans' of mango leaves decorate the entrance.
The swastik has been drawn on the brass pot. . . a coconut
touched with ‘kurn-kum' placed in it. . . the scent of lighted
joss-sticks ﬁlls the air. In the shadow of these emblems of
celebration and achievement, there glearns an unobtrusive

brass plate with the inscription: ‘Supplied by VOLTAS’.
Soon, another plant will go into production.
