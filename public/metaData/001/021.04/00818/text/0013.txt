The earliest pots were made of grass baskets plastered
POTTERY with mud and then hardened in the sun. But now
exquisitely beautiful. glazed and coloured pottery articles are individually
made by India's craftsmen in a great variety of designs and shapes.
The famed blue pottery of DELHI, blue and white bowls and
vases from JAlPUR and KHURJA, unglazed pottery from BOMBAY and
the KARIGARI bowls and Kujas in blue or green glaze or in natural
white. all have their characteristic charm. Bll-lAR and BENGAL excel
in adapting ancient art symbols in modern terracotta and pottery.
