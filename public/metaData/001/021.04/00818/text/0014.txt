TO
HELP
THE CU RED TB PATIENTS
There is no greater investment than rehabilitation when
we know what wonderful dividends it pays, what pleasure it
brings into the lives of people to be taught new trades and
new handicrafts, and to help turn their lives into usefulness
and happiness, rather than dragging themselves through drab
and lonely years of frustration.
Your State TB Associations require funds for the
rehablitation of the TB patients. Seal Sale Campaign is the
best method to raise funds. People should buy TB Seals.

Remember
A TB SEAL COSTS l0 NAYE PAISE ONLY
