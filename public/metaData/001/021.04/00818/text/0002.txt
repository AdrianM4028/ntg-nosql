I‘Iere a man stacking tinplate in the godown
. , . there a mechanic making dies on a
precision machine-tool . . . in the printing
room a skilled operator working on a highspeed press. . . in the laboratory a chemist
experimenting on a container lacquer . . . plus
artists, salesmen, clerks . . .
Having commenced operations in 1933 with
only a handful of men, Metal Box today
employ a staff of over 5,000. And, Metal
B'ox supply a wide range of containers
and closures to over 1,000 packers and
bottlers who together employ more than
80,000 workers !

As in any progressive company, the strength
of Metal Box lies largely in their attitude
towards their employees many of whom

have been with them for over 20 years.
Nearly forty promising young men have
received training abroad in order to contribute better to the Company’s activities.

As India’s economy expands rapidly, an
increasingly greater, more complex burden
will have to be borne by the packaging '
industry. As leaders in the ﬁeld, Metal

Box are ready to meet this challenge of
the future with all their resources and all
their experience.
