The Three Penny Opera (Die Dreigroschenoper, 1928), an adaptation of John Gay’s ‘The Beggar’s
Opera’ (1928) with music by Kurt Weill. The plot is basically the same as “The Beggar’s Opera’,
although little of the original text remains and the setting is that of late — 19th century Soho. By
marrying Polly Peachum, the robber Macheath incurs the wrath of Polly’s father, the king of beggars,
who plans to have him arrested. But the chief of the police, Tiger Brown, is an old boyhood friend of
Macheath and hesitates to arrest him. Macheath however, is betrayed by a prostitute and arrested at
his favourite brothel. Soon after, he escapes from jail with the help of Brown’s daughter, Lucy, whom
he has assured of his love. Now Peachum’s threat to spoil a royal procession through the city by
sending hoards of beggars in its path forces Tiger Brown to act. Macheath is arrested again at the
same brothel, condemned to death, and sent to the scaffold. At the last moment a messenger arrives
with the Queen’s pardon and the promise of a litle and a pension for Macheath. The moral : the
Bourgeois and the criminals are one of a kind.
