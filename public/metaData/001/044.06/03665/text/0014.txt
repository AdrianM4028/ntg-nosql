This is precisely our problem when we deal with the
production of Sanskrit drama too. We still have an
uneasy relationship with our past, our heritage, our

performance traditions. Only in the vaguest manner
we are aware of our ancient traditions. It is more
pronounced in our acting style. In a single scene we
keep shifting from conversational prose to poetic

verse and to melodious songs and struggle to create

situation, any attempt to evolve a system of actor-

training becomes a hazardous ventur’e. Add to this,
the paucity of perforrnable / playable translations of
Sanskrit plays in Modern Indian languages. And
actors of contemporary Indian theatre, most of them

trained in naturalistic / realistic acting, struggle very
hard to come to terms with the literary and
performance text of Sanskrit drama.
We confronted all these problems in this production

of Kalidasa's Malavikagnimitram at many levels. Our
efforts to overcome them, in our own limited ways, in
the course of this academic exercise, is in front of

you.
This is the first public performance of this batch of
students.
I am really fortunate to have my teachers - H V
Sharma, Bhaskar Chandavarkar, Robin Das and
Amba Sanyal — guide me and my students in music

and design. I am extremely grateful to them.
It is their efforts and my students‘ involvement made
this production possible. All the defects you may find
are entirely mine.
