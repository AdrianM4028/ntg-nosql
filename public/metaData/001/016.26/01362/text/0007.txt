Abhinaya is a fraternity of young artistes

bent on contributing its mite m: the
advancement of theatre.

We assemble on the arena of Abhinaya
reading, discussing and practising plays

with a view to exploring the true dramatic
art.

Meanwhile, we intend to organise theatre
workshops and drama festivals. We also
plan to start a library for drama that could
be utilised by exponents and new entrants
in the field.

Abhinaya will play host to eminent
playwrights, actors, painters, sculptors and

other artistes, enabling its members to
interact with them.

We request you to call at Abhinaya at your

THEATRE OE WASTE

One of the motor aims of Abhinaya is to create a ’theotre of
waste using the discarded materials at society. The term
waste denotes those objects which the society deems as

useless and hence throws oil.

Abhinaya intends to make good such waste material. It
envisages a theatre in which artistes from among the
physically handicapped and-those released from prison could
be accommodated to advantage. Street singers and nomadic
be
performers are omer such groups whose potential can
topped.
