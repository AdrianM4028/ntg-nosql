Director’s Note

The production uses the narrative techniques of Karkan a

traditional mode of narration of the ’Bawa Jitto legend in the hilly
areas of Jarnmu region,

Other folk forms that are used in this

play are Jater, Geetru, and elements of hern, kud and sauian, The

whole production is not conﬁned to these forms, but the idea is to
ﬁnd out a contemporary theatre idiom inspired by these forms,
