I wish all success for the programme being conducted by the
members of the Dramatic Club, ’NA TRANG’, Jammu on March 5, 7985

in connection with the celebrations of International Youth Year.
They have already presented a number of modern plays on the stages
of various theatres in the State as well as out side. I hope they will
continue to show their talent in Drama and inspire the interest of the
people in this art.
