M E SSAG E
I highly appreciate the initiative of Balwant Thakur and his friends,
students from various departments Of Jammu University in forming a dramatic
Club named 'NATRANG’

They have al eady presented a number of modern

plays on the stage of Abhinav Theatre, Jammu.

Recently their presentation

"CHAURAHA" was adjugded as the best play from Jammu District in the
Inter-District Drama Competition organised by Cultural Academy, Jammu.

I hope they will continue to show their talent in Drama and bring glory to
themselves and also to. their respective Departments and the university to
which they belong.
I wish them all success in their endeavour.
