OF
THE

PLAY

MERE BH A l : MERE

DOST

The recent happenings in Bangla Desh have once again brought
to focuss the innate differences between India and Pakistan, present from

their very genesis. They are votaries of two different and diagonally opposite
ideologies.
Pakistan

While India epitornises the values of secularism and democracy,
is

embodiment

of

theocracy

and

intolerance.

The

play

“MERE BHAI : MERE DOST” presents this fact of contemporary history
in

intimate

human

idioms-tragic,

romantic, comic, noble, sublime etc.

through characters that are personal, living and true to life.

The portrayal

of our times and contemporary scene has been done in intensely bold
colours and relief.
