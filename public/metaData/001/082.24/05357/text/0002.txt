Now, we see another on the Kannada stage

performing a similar but more difficult feat with
such easy abandon. C.R. Simha does it. In fact,
—Simha has been doing it over these three months, ever
since the Kailasam Birth Centenary Year began. He
recreates with telling effect the image of Kai-Kai
the man, the playwright, the poet, the humourist, not
to speak of the most powerful characters in Kai's
plays, Poly ﬁitti, Lawyer Ahoblu and his cribbing
wife Jeevu, Drona, Arjuna, Ekalavya etc.

The whole

episode relates to the last two hours in Kai's life
as imagined by the script writer T.N. Narasimhan; but
Simha lives it on the stage all by himself as only
Simha could.
Sinma really came with a roar about a decade and
a half ago (1969) when he directed Karnad's Thuglaq,
and he donned the mantle of Thuglaq himself. He had
become a fimiliar figure on the Kannada Stage even
earlier. But, Thuglaq opened the floodgates of his
acting talent, and thereafter, it was a series of

one achievement after another.

FOr the first time

in Karnataka, he di rected Shakespeare ' s Midsunlner
Night's Dream and Othello in Knnada and himself
'Kakana Kote',
acted in the main roles;inaboth.
