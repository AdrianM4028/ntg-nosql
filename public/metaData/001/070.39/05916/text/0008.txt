LOBH

NASAVA

HI

VINANTI

Lobh nasava hi vinanti is a straight
translation of John Patrick’s The Hasty

Heart, and the original setting and
character of Patrick’s play have been kept
intact. It is a, ward in an army hospital on
the Burma front during the last war. The
patients represent almost all the Allied
countries. They are looked after by a
kindly young nurse called Sister Margaret.
When a Scotch soldier joins them, it takes
a long time to break the ice between him
and the other inmates. The knowledge that
he is doomed to die soon makes them go
out of their way to be friendly to him.
But a proud introvert, he misunderstands
their simple, human gesture.
The play ends with a moving reconciliation
between the Scot and those he leaves
behind.

The playwright introduces to us a group
rehearsing a mock trial in a mofussil hall.
Most of the usual members of the group,
which regularly gives public performances
of this mock trial, are present. For the
rehearsal, a spinsterish school-teacher,

Miss Benare, is put in the dock. The
playwright then shows her colleagues
actually unravelling a tragic affair in which
she is involved. The rehearsal is only a
pretext for censuring her for her allegedly
immoral conduct. In the process, it is the
heartlessness and stupidity of these
predatory colleagues which stands exposed.
The play satirizes various types of social
workers, but etches out a very human and
moving portrait of its central character.
