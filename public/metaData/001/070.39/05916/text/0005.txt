आत्तापवैतची वाटचाल

Hello .’
Rangayan here!

सं पूर्ण ना टके

You don’t know who we are .7 Then obviously

ससा आणि कासव

you are a non-Maharashtrian.
Well, no, it doesn’t matter really. You love
theatre anyway, don’t you ? Then we sure
have there a common platform.
We mean a common something. We shall be
on the stage, you see, and you shall be there
right in front. That’s a real confrontation.
And then we can speak.
So, here’s what we are.

मैं जिता मैं हारा

Yes, we are a group of performers. That’s
really secondary. First thing ﬁrst, we are a
bunch of people who just love theatre. A na’
then there are many among us who can act as
well. So somebody said: why not stage some
play? That started it, see!
That’s a long time back, anyway. But we never
tired of this little game. So one after another
the plays started coming up on the sage.
Not that the plays were always in plenty
waiting to go on to the stage.“ No, sometimes
we too had to wait for a good play to play.
But sooner or later come they did. And we
went on.
Ah, but you must be bored by now. Well,
who isn’t ? We too like less to talk—least
when the talk has to be about ourselves—and
more to play.
So the play is the thing.
And then you may take the stage, when the
play is over, and do the talking for a change
—we would like to listen to what you
have to say.
