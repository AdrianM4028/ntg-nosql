Ieevit Ya Mrit
Dramatization : Geetanjali Shree
Director: Anuradha Kapur
Group : Vivadi, New Delhi

About the play
Our adaptation of Tagore’s great short story Jeevit Ya Marit, is by Geetanjali
Shree, and it seeks to place the inner monologue of Kadambani into the world;
into domains sites and interior landscapes inhabited by memory hallucination
dream and desire. in the performance we have tried to use everyday objects, the
detritus that death leaves behind into which bodies are sometimes thought to
awaken or thought walk paths that take them past the living world .objects that
may be employed for obscuring memory, or for providing ministrations on
death’s itinerary, or those that are forsaken along with the body for an ultimate
erasure. seems bis was performs the narrative attempting to move form

characters which populate the story to speech that belongs to kadambini that is
played out in her mind as soliloquy, also to speech for communication, through
which kadambini expresses herself to others; all these registers of speech of
course also belongs to women who navigate different kinds of death through
their lives widows.
