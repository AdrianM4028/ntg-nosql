Sandhya Chhaya is a story about an old couple, an aged couple who spent their lives
in the upbringing oftheir children and they are the ones who live alone and long for the love,
affection and togetherness oftheir children.

It is a story about a man and woman fondly called Nana. Nani respectively and it deals
with the emotional turmoil the parents have to go through. In spite ofhaving being deprived
of love from their children, they still have the courage to fight the melancholy and pathos of
their lives. They support and love each other and as the play unfolds, the audience also falls
in love with them.

Older people who are not so useful in today's materialistic age bear the brunt of the
changing values. They get lonelier and lonelier. This play is entertaining and
simultaneously it tells us about old age and Loneliness. It is a great play, which can be very
easily called a classic ofModem times.
They have two sons, Deenu (the elder one) and Nandu (the younger one). Deenu is
settled in USA and Nandi is in the Air Force. Deenu very rarely comes to meet his parents.
He just sends money at regular intervals, meanwhile as the play progresses, they get to

know that Nandu has been killed in the war. The whole play revolves on the nuclear
families' concept where in the parents are left alone and their children are settled
somewhere else.
The whole play is poignant collective mixture ofemotions portrayed by an old couple ,
be it happiness, loneliness, love for kids, their childhood etc.

On the whole, the play stresses on the fact and asks the society a very straightforward
question that parents who have been there for us the whole life, do they deserve such a
lonely old age? Do they really?
