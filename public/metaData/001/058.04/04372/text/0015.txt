Play
The play Parityakta deals with the story of ‘Karna’ with the ‘time’ or
it deals with ‘time’ in the story of ‘Karna’ . The ‘Kalagna’ is an imaginative
character and he will take a long journey with the ‘time (Bhoota, Vartamana,
Bhavishya) and narrates the story of ‘Karna’. In the beginning, he is on
Kama’s side but ﬁnally agrees, with ‘Time’.

On the other hand, one could notice, a tremendous friendship between
Kama and Suyodhana. The strength of this play lies in “the dream world of
Kama and Kunthi”. The whole production is in the form of poetic narration,
both script wise and presentation.
