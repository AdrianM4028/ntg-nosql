Play
The Play Huliseere is a culmination of both folk and modern themes.
The present day mankind has not just witnessed the physical division but
also the division within the human emotions and drifting away form the
culture and tradition. We are but the tools in the hands of the promoters of
pseudo culture. This has posed a challenge to the young minds of the present
generation. Relationship needs to be redefined and built on the foundation
of humanity. In the context of Globalization and Commercialization, there
is a need for searching ‘oneness’ and ‘unity’. The present play deals with
this theme. The style of the play is musical.
