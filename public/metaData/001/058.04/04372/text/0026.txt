The play
Bharata. The theme of the play has contemporary relevance.
It depicts as to how the politicians make use of the common people and
rise to the throne at the cost of helpless and miserable people.
The play unfolds the situation after the Maha Bharata
war - Kurukshetra - in which we find Draupadi and Dharamaraja look
back by introspection.
