Play
Ushaharana is a play written by Shanthakavi of Haveri district. As
everybody knows Shanthakavi (Sakkari Baalacharya) was the man who
founded the first professional Theatre Company in Karnataka.

In Kannada, Theatre was the best tool for any writer for his linguistic
struggle. When Original Kannada theatre was loosing its ground and was
getting weaker and weaker everyday, due to heavy inﬂuence of Marathi
Theatre, this was the first Kannada Play to face the attack of the ‘other’
force.
Even today the attack of the ‘other forces’ continues at different levels
and in different aspects. We are also in search of the real Kannada Theatre
language for the present day theatre in Kannada. By choosing this play
written in 1856, it initiated a debate between Kannada and Karnataka,

Language and Theatre.
This play tries to reconstruct the basic theatre by dismantling the ‘other
forces’. Hence, this performance is an idol of mud on the Golden Throne.
