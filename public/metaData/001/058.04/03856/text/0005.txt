Rang Sangam Vasant Natyotsav 2008
Sangeet Natak Akademi is glad to present a festival of plays produced

by some of our well known directors in different languages. The
festival represents a conﬂuence of creative ideas, methods, techniques

and practices constantly evolving in thefield of theatre in different
parts of the country. The twelve directors invited to participate bring

an eclectic mix offorrns, styles and approaches; together they oﬁ‘er a
small, but nonetheless, significant view of the best of theatre made by
today '5 generation. They represent both youth and experience, but
they have all made a mark in thefield and earnedfame beyond their

regions. Thefestival will appropriately open with a performance of
Tamasha, popular tradition ofMaharashtra.

The Sangeet Natak Akademi oﬁ‘ers Rang Sangam Vasant
Natyotsav to the theatre lover ofMaharashtra with the hope that

it will savour its taste in the best tradition ofa rang-rasika. The
land ofMaharashtra so wonderfully rich in dance, drama and music
would surely serve an ideal rang-kshetra for the performers.
This has been made possible with the active support and

cooperation of the Academy of Theatre Arts, University of Mumbai

which agreed to host thefestival and celebrate it as Vasant
Natyotsav. We are particularly thankful. to Prof. Waman Kendre,

Head of the Academy of Theatre Arts, University ofMumbaifor his
keen interest and initiative in planning and organising the event in
Mu m ba i.
