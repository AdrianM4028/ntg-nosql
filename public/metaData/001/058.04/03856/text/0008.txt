The Play

The Tamasha vagrzatya, Sasarcha Vishari Vilkha is based on a real life-story

of Kolhapur. It opens with characters from an educated family in a small
town. The major characters, a greedy woman teacher and her son are
the members of this family. The son marries a poor but well-mannered
girl. Everything goes well till the cunning son and his mother desire a

lot of money. They force the poor girl to go to a moneylender to serve

him as a prostitute. After this incidence, the girl commits suicide.
The mother gets her son married again through deceit. Their

desire to be rich is still not fulfilled, and they play the same trick with
the second girl as well. However, unlike the first girl, she refuses to

follow their orders; instead, she seeks the help of her father-in-law, a
good-natured person, to teach them a lesson. She unites the women of

the town and takes the revenge on behalf of the first girl.
