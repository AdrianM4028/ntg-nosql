Urdu play,
acting, production process and voice and speech in the Academy of
Theatre Arts, University of Mumbai.

The Group

The Academy of Theatre Arts was established in 2003. The University of
Mumbai initiated this Academy keeping in mind the dearth of theatre
training institutes in Mumbai, despite the city being the main centre
of theatre activity in the country.
The Academy offers a two-year full time comprehensive master’s
degree course in Theatre Arts. This is an integrated course comprising
the study of various theory and practical subjects such as dramatic
literature (Western, Eastern and Indian), acting, direction, body

expression and movement, different martial arts, yoga, music, voice
and speech, traditional and modern dances, play analysis and play
writing, make-up, light designing, set-design, theatre architecture, and
costume design.
The students are given ample opportunities to watch and study
plays and interact with theatre personalities at various festivals,

performances and seminars thereby exposing them to current theatre
practicesThe Academy of Theatre Arts has started its own National
Theatre Festival, Vasant Natyotsav and also Rangavedh (a seminar on

various issues related to theatre practices) to meet these demands.
In order to introduce the students to Indian theatre tradition as
well as the world theatre, the Academy of Theatre Arts has produced
plays like Madhyam Vyayog and Vedhapashya (dir: Prof. Waman Kendre),
