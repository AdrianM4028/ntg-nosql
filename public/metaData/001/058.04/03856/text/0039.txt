Adaptation of Shakespear’s Macbeth. Written by Shiv Mehta
Directed by MUSHTAQ KAK, Jammu
Duration: 105 minutes

Director’s Note
What does Shakespeare have to do with life in the State of Jammu
and Kashmir in the early years of the 21th Century? Speciﬁcally, why
should we be attending a performance of the play Rattdi Ratt (Blood
and Gore) in Dogri based on Macbeth in 2008? Macbeth was written,
and originally performed in 1606 in a society that was in turmoil. 1603
had been a plague year in England; over thirty thousand people had
died of the dreaded ’black death’. In November 1605, a terrorist plot

to literally blow up the British Parliament came so close to succeeding
that the possibility of complete anarchy became a tangible reality.
Fatal epidemics? Anti-government terrorism? Bomb plots? Spin
doctoring politicians? Religious fundamentalism? Are we talking about
the beginning of the 17th Century or of the 21st?
What we often forget is that Shakespeare was a consummate
showman. He wrote as well as produced plays. He did everything in
his power to entertain as well as enlighten his audience. Records of
how these plays were performed by his company are sketchy. What
we do have is the words. The glorious glittering words! These words
do not belong to the dusty shelves of literature.
It has been a real challenge to produce the play in Dogri on a
shoestring budget with actors having no previous experience of theatre.
