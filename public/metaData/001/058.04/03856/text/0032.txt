The Play
The play has two parallel stories: one of Nautanki being performed
on the stage and the other on real life of an actor. An actor has been
enacting the role of Raja Harishchandra in Nautankis for years together
and does not remember when people started calling him Harischannar
Babu and then Master Haria. While portraying the role, he imbibes the
character of Raja Harishchandra of speaking nothing but truth in real life
as well. The result is that whereas he gets rewards for his performances
for speaking the truth in Nautankis, he gets beating and humiliation
in real life for the same. In Nautanki, Lord Vishnu saves Raja’s son
Rohitashva, when he is bitten by a snake, but Master Haria’s son dies

as he could not be treated in the hospital since the bed was reserved
for the son of a minister.
Initially, his wife does not support him and advises him to be
practical and materialistic in life. However, she succumbs to his
pressures and in fighting for truth, she loses her life but with a promise
from her husband that he will carry the torch with his optimistic
approach.
