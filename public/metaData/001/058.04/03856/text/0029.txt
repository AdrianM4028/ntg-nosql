costume, masks is prescribed with the elements of Bhoota Kola folk
tradition of Karnataka. In this play, the principal focus is on the serious
treatment of philosophical ideas of Death. In Hindu mythology Yama
represents god of death, in this folk belief female Goddess Mahaamayi

represents the Goddess of Death, and her adopted son Sanjiva Shiva,
traditionally known life-saving doctor, represents the human side.
The myth of Shetavi Mayi, used symbolically, is an attempt to reach
beyond everyday reality — the conﬂict between the mother and the
son. She shows womanhood to her son, imposes love and affection, but

Sanjiva Shiva wants freedom from his supernatural mother to testify
his experiments in medical science. Madanatilaka, another character
potrays living human being as selfish and basically immoral product of
environment, prefers to portray the comic style. The play episodically
reveals with narrative poetic style and typically involves people who are
faced with a forced decision than to an awareness of the choice between
living on their own terms or ceasing to exist as a free individual from
one’s own destiny.
