In Srushti Sankalp, Radha is the victim of the ’primordial fear’
that haunts a Woman, that of being abandoned by her beloved. She
commands her '

‘ draw the blinds, to close the windows and

doors so that for once, Nature stands as the mute witness while they
enact their divine love-play. She wishes to stay away from Nature,
and to live as a Beckoning — a call for her Kanu. She bids the Ocean
to wait at the door; she bids Time and Space to stand still. She claims
that Time is now held prisoner in the braids of her tresses.
In Itihaas, Kanu has gone . . . to create History . . . leaving a forlorn,

lost Radha behind. Radh a is inconsolable; life has become an agony, an
ache, a void. She spends her days reliving the memories of her moments

with Kanu. She claims that history owed a lot to her, because she was

the one who paid a price and the world was to gain at her cost.
The war is over, but at what cost? Who has won, who has lost?

Radha tells Kanu that she saw the ocean in her dream . . . she saw
Kanu exhausted, sad, desolate and lonely. History staggers onward
on crutches — and Kanu finally remembers her — he is seeking her
for solace, for comfort. Finally, he abandons History like old clothes,
and he yearns to go to Radha for comfort. And, Kanupriya Radha has
been waiting to join her Kanu!
Director’s Note
Science has gifted us many opportunities to develop but it has
simultaneously loaded with the unfortunate acts of destruction. We
are afraid of the third World War but big nations indulge in acts which
are an invitation to war. These are hard times in which Kanupriya has
its high validity.
