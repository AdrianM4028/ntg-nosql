The Play
Kanupriya defines the relationship of Radha and Krishna from the
point of View of Radha. The entire composition has been divided into
four sections: Poorvraag, Manjari Parinay, Srishti Sankalp, and finally,
Itihaas.
In Poorvraag, Krishna pretends to be indifferent to Radha in the
beginning, but later, he demands nothing short of complete surrender.
Radha, right from the beginning, believes that Krishna is part of her
being, and they are, in fact, one. There is a sense of dissolution of the

self, blending into the Eternal. Radha sees Krishna in the Nature around
her —— in the swirling waters of the Yamuna that caresses her as she
bathes.
In Manjari Parinay, Radha attempts to define her relationship with
Krishna, and put a name to it. Sometimes she feels that Kanu is her
eternal playmate, or her protector and guardian. Other times, she feels
maternal towards him; yet there are times when she feels that both
of them are one entity. He’s the Omniscient, Omnipotent — the All

Pervading Reality! He transcends the boundaries of time, space and
name. It is beyond the comprehension of the mortal, tangible world. For
the same reason, the relationship of Radha and Krishna has remained
an eternal mystery since time immemorial.
