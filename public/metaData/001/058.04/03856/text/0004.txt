“In the field of dance, the great variety of Indian styles has attracted
the notice of all students of arts and culture . . . What is most remarkable

is the continuity of the traditions and the vigour they display to this day

“In the field of theory of drama, Indian achievements are perhaps
still more remarkable and serve as models even to this day . . .

”. . . in the field of music . . . The co—operation of Hindus
and Muslims for almost a thousand years has . . . brought about a
consummation that has perhaps no equal in the world . . .

“This precious heritage of dance, drama and music is one which we

must cherish and develop. ”
— Maulana Abul Kalam Azad
