The Play
Shetavi, the ’goddess of fate’ in the folklore, described as the ’goddess

of death’ in the prologue, has adopted Sanjiva, an orphan, and blessed

him with great medical skills and healing powers. But, he can save
only those whom the goddess favours as we see in the opening scene
itself. Out of the three patients — Madan the court jester, Mara the
grave—digger and a young cowherd boy — Sanjiva wants to save the
boy but the mother decides the boy should die and the other two live.
Sanjiva loves his mother but feels frustrated by the total lack of freedom.
Through Madan, Sanjiva learns that the daughter of the local King is
suffering from a strange disease which no doctor has been able to cure.
When by chance a meeting brings Sanjiva and the princess together,
Sanjiva decides to restore the princess to health, in spite of the fact that
the Mother appearing as an old woman gives clear signals that she
should die. This results in an open confrontation between the mother
and the son. The Mother demonstrates her strength by causing the
death of Sanjiva’s pet deer, Netravati and later by taking away the life
