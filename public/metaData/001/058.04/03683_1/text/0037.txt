KHANGEMBAM MANGI SINGH
Akademi Award: Traditional Music ofManipur (Pena)
Shri Khangembam Mangi Singh was born in 1926 at Lamshang in Manipur: He was trained in the Phamsha/e style of
Pena performance —— where the artist, seated, plays the instrument as he renders devotional songs —— under Kh. meei,
Phamdom Sanajao, and Guru Yumnam Kanhai. He learnt Lai Haraoba performance from Guru Laishram Mohon and
Kolom Amu, and also trained in rendering the Moirang Parva — epics ofMoirang — and the courtyard drama Tho/e
Leela. His training in these arts was conducted in accordance with the Oja—lehanba system, Manipur's version ofthe
guru-shishya parampara.
Shri Mangi Singh joined the fawaharlal Nehru Manipur Dance Academy ofImphal as a Guru in 1975. There he is
credited with introducing the Phamjei style in Pena performance — a variant of the Phamshah mode with accompanying
artists perﬁrrming with the main musician. He has participated in various seminars and workshops centred around the
traditional arts, both at home and abroad. He has also performed extensively within and outside Manipur.

A documentary ﬁlm on Shri Mangi Singh is currently being made by Manipur University and Laihui, an institution
dedicated to preserving Pena music. Doordarshan Kendra, Imphal, has documented his Phamsha/e and Cholom
performances with Pena, the latter being a variant where the musician performs dancing.

For his service to the traditional arts ofManipur, Shri Mangi Singh has been honoured by the Manipur State
Kala Academy.
Shri Khangembam Mangi Singh receives the Sangeet Natah Ahademi Awardfor his contribution to the traditional
music ofManipur.
