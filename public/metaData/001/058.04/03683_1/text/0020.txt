MUN NA S HUKLA
Akademi Award: Kathak
Shri Munna Lal Shukla was born in 1943 in Lucknow into a family of traditional Kathak artists. He was initiated in
the dance by his ﬁzther Sunderlal Shukla and later studied under Pandit Birju Maharaj. Alongside Kathak dance, he
acquired proﬁciency in Tabla and vocal music.

A highly experienced Kathak teacher and dancer, Shri Munna Lal Shukla is also known as a Kathak choreographer of
note. His own art as a dancer is not only an admirable blend ofmeticulous anga—bhava and intricate footwork, but also
a deft balancing of rhythmic numbers with expressional ones which are by no means conﬁned to shringara rasa.

Delhi. At present, he is a senior guru at Bharatiya Kala Kendra in Delhi. At Pune, he choreographed duet and group
compositions such as Talamala, Rajput Ramani, Shahi Mehﬁl, Kathak ki Kahani, and Holi besides ﬁrur full-length
dramas: Kaliyadaman, Makhanleela, Bansilila, and Shyam Bansuriya. Other creative work done by him comprises
Shan—e-Mughal, a ﬁill-length dance drama ﬁrr Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra; Tratak, Kathak Prasang, Anvesha,
Krauncha—vadh, Chaturanga, Anga—mukti, Raganvita, Govardhan, and Kathakayan for Kathak Kendra. For the
National School ofDrama in Delhi, he has created the opera Indra Sabha (1996) and directed the play Azeezunnisa

(1998). He has performed and taught Kathak in japan and several countries in Europe and Africa.
