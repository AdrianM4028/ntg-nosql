M UN NA SH UKLA
Shri Munna Lal Shukla was
born in 1943 in Lucknow into

a family of traditional Kathak
artists. He was initiated in the
dance by his father Sunderlal
Shukla and later studied under

Pandit Birju Maharaj.
Alongside Kathak dance, he

acquired proficiency in Tabla
and vocal music.

A highly experienced Kathak
teacher and dancer, Shri

Munna Lal Shukla is also
known as a Kathak

choreographer of note. His
own art as a dancer is not only
an admirable blend of
meticulous anga—bhava and
intricate footwork, but also a
deft balancing of rhythmic

From 1968 to 1975, he taught
the dance at Kala Chhaya in
