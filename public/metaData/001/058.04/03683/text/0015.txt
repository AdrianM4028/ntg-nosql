a family of traditional
musicians of the Dhadi
community. He was trained at
an early age in rendering the
songs of the Dhadis by his
father Idu, who was a

prominent Dhadi singer ofhis
time.
Today, Shri SarifIdu

Chundhar is very well known
for his performances of Dhadi
songs. He has performed
extensively all over Punjab and
represented his State in
festivals held in other parts of
the country, such as Apna
Utsav held in Delhi in 1986.
He has performed at the
National Games in Ludhiana,
the Indoâ€”Pak Punjab Games at
Patiala, and in various

traditional fairs and festivals.
He has thereby won for
himself a large following
among the masses of Punjab.

traditional singing of the

Dhadis of Punjab, Shri Sarif
Idu has been honoured by
various institutions in India.
