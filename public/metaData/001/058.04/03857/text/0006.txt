Rang Pratiba Theater Festival, as the name suggest, is a theatre
festival of as many as 7 plays produced by young theatre Directors of the State
who are below the age of 35 years and who at the young age have dedicated
their lives to the art of theatre, new forms, styles and approaches in the field.

They have carved a niche in the firrnarnent of theatre not only in the State but
also at the national level in view of their creative ideas and novel creations in
theatre. They have been chosen for this festival by a Committee of Experts
selected by the Sangeet NatakAkademi. In fact, this festival is being organized
by the Sangeet NatakAkademi, New Delhi in association with State Academy,
as usual. We are thankful to them for organising this festivals in our state. The
festival will commence from 9th of March and will conclude on 16th of March,

My good wishes for the success of the festival .
