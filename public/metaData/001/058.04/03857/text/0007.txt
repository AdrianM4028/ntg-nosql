ABOUT THE PLAY :
The story of the play revolves around an industrialist ‘Bidla’ who has liaison with ultras. He also happens to

be involved in series of bomb blasts that rocked Mumbai few years back. To escape official interest and to
get few undesirable demands met, he rnasterrninds his own abduction. While carrying out his plan, he
meets with a grave road accident.
Shaligram, a welder and Union leader in the factory of ‘Bidla’ is witness to that gory accident. The impact of
accident is such that car catches fire and face of ‘Bidla’ is burnt beyond recognition. Oblivious to the fact
that person concerned is his employer; Shaligram wraps the victim in his own coat to put out fire and takes
him to the hospital.
In hospital, Bidla’ is mistaken by doctors as Shaligram and in cosmetic surgery the face of Shaligram is
done up (grafted) on ‘Bidla’. Police nabs Shaligram for Bidla’s abduction and Shaligram is implicated and
harassed for a crime, which was never committed.
