DIRECTOR’S NOTE
‘Comedy of Terrors’ has something for everyone and one of my choicest scripts as I consider Comedy to be
a very powerful genre‘ of theatrical presentation. The play asks for a highest degree of integrated
professional Acting because of its plot, structure & scene scheme and I took it as a challenge keeping full
faith on my lead actorAnil Tikoo- a versatile actor who has amazing acting capabilities. My endeavor in this
respect was to explore the best in him.

We are in an era of collaborations and theatre to my belief is one of the major platform for artistic and
creative exchanges and sharing. Since I had started doing theatre, I have always been seeking to create
an amalgamation of varied skills & talents i.e. a powerful script, intense acting, innovative props &
costuvrlnes,*lights, music and a lot more. A humble attempt has been madeto explore further possibilities

limited resources.
