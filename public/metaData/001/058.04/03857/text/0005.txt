Rang Pratibha
Sangeet NatakAkademi is glad to present the festival of plays by young directors of Jarnmu
& Kashmir in collaboration with J & K Academy of Art Culture & Languages. This is the thirteenth 1211111: 11111111: K
of a series of festivals planned in different states of the country to bring to the fore new talents in
contemporary theatre. The festivals held at Assam. Manipur and Tripura were called “Swarn
Rang Pratibha” and were dedicated to the Golden Jubilee of the Akaderni, which included
celebrations by way of festival and seminars in music, dance and drama in different states and at
Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Sikkim, Kerala, Mizoram, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Orissa and

Karnataka in the name of ‘Rang Pratibha’.
The festival features plays of 10 young directors of the State of Jammu & Kashmir chosen by
a committee of expert from the state. Apart from the stage performance there will be interactions
with the theatre experts and Observers who are invited both within the state as well as from other
parts of the county. It is hoped that this will give the young directors an opportunity to grow further
and take their works of art beyond the boundaries of the state.
