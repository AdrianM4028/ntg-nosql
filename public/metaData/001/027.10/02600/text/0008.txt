Such is the fate of theatre in India that such groups who excel in being proud of
their long record of indifferent and insipid productions get the maximum grant from
Government and Governmet aided bodies through their connections and manoeuvrings.
Whereas Trained and Talented and Dedicated people have to work so hard and face many
ﬁnancial worries and obstacles to continue doing theatre.
Of and on some talented people do join such groups feeling that their predecessors
probably could not adjust or perhaps they will be able 10 bring some change. But what
happens after some time, most of them leave and the remaining become smugs and complacent about the whole thing and work for bringing their downfall by selling cheaply their well
earned reputations.
Do these Old Senile Bosses have no merits? They have but not in and for the
theatre. The are, at least quite many of them, capable of proving their worth in other
walks of life such as Politics and Business like selling machines or eatables or even working
in some administrative jobs.
