army of Goths, and Tamora
arranges a peace conference,
hoping to trick him. Presuming
that Titus is demented, she
disguises herself as Revenge and
taunts him before going to the
conference. However, she
returns to a banquet served by

Titus, only to find that her sons
have been killed and their bones
ground into the food. Titus first

kills Tamora and then, to end her
misery, Lavinia; Saturninus kills
Titus; and Lucius kills Saturninus.

From a balcony the saddened
Lucius then tells the peOple the
evil story. He is proclaimed
Emperor. Aaron, who has been
found among the Goths and
brought back by Lucius, is
condemned to a lingering death
by starvation.
