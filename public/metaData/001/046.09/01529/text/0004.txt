AN EXTRACT FROM THE 'RAPE OF LUCRECE'

So she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,
Holds disputation with each thing she views,
And to herself all sorrow doth compare;
No object but her passion's strength renews,
And as one shifts, another straight ensures.
Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
Sometime'tis made and too much talk affords.
The little birds that tune their morning's joy
Make her moans mad with their sweet melody:
For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy;

Sad souls are slain in merry company;
Grief best is pleased with griefâ€˜s society:

True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
When with like semblance it is sympathized.
'You mocking birds;' quoth she, 'your tunes entornb
Within your hollow-swelling feathered breasts,
And in my hearing be you mute and dumb.
My restless discord loves no stops nor rests;
A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests.
Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
Come, Philomel, that sing'st of ravishrnent,
make thy sad grove in my dishevelled hair.
As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment,

So" I at each sad strain will strain a tear,
And with deep groans the diapason bear;
For burthen-wise l'll hum on Tarquin still,
While thou on Tereus descants better skll.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
