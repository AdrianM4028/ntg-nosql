ABOUT THE PLAY

Titus Andronicus A

Melodrarnatic tragedy in which
Titus Andronicus, having led the
Romans to victory over the
Goths, is offered the imperial
crown, which he declines,
supporting the claim of
Saturninus, the former Emperor's
eldest son, and promises him the
hand of his daughter Lavinia.
However, Bassianus, younger

brother of saturninus, abducts
her, aided by Titus's sons, one of
whom Titus kills when the boy
blocks his pursuit of Lavinia.

Saturninus now chooses to marry
Tamora, captured Queen of the
Goths, who despises Titus
because he has killed one of her
sons. Tamora influences
Saturninus's jealousy of Titus's
pOpularity with the people and his
anger at losing Lavinia. Both

continue to feign friendship for
him, attending a hunt Titus has
arranged. When Tamora and her
lover, the Moor Aaron, are

discovered during the hunt by
Bassianus and Lavinia, Tamora

gives orders for them to be
silenced. Her sons kill Bassianus,
throwing his remains in a pit, and

rape Lavinia, before cutting off

her hands and tongue. Then
Titus's sons Martius and Quintus,
drawn to the camouflaged pit by
Aaron, stumble into it. When
Saturninus is brought to witness
the scene, the brothers are
accused of Bassianus's murder.
Later, in Rome, Titus
pleads for Martius and Quintus,
and Aaron promises that if Titus
will chop off his hand and send it
to the Emperor, they will be
spared. Titus complies, but his
hand is returned with the heads of
his executed sons. Vowing
revenge, Titus orders another

to rescue his brothers, to form an
army among the Goths. Lavinia
manages to explain her mutilation

by writing the names of Tamora's
sons in the sand on the floor.
Titus now feigns madness in order
to expose the criminals.
Meanwhile, Tamora has secretly
given birth to a black child and,

fearing it will be discovered by
Saturninus, sends it to Aaron,
who kills all witnesses and retuns
a white child to take its place. He
