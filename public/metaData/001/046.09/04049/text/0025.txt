After seven years of legal battle against the implication of soliciting by the police, Kiran and a few
other Bedin performers won the case. For them it was an attempt to retrieve part of that dignity
that had been denied to them by tradition and deprivation.
The Bedin is a performer by caste and not by choice.The caste hierarchy places her at the lowest
rung of the social ladder, where she stands deprived and vulnerable. The system manipulates this
situation — whether it be the feudal haveli; the nautanki in an upcoming industrial township; or the
bar of a metropolis.The road that connects the village to the globe is her life. She moves and
struggles to survive. Not everyone can sing and dance.An ability to do so is precious to all of us
and so, must it be with the Bedin. Except that we have decided not to do so.And thus, perhaps,
have lost something that may be within us too.
The present production has been an attempt by young theatre students to look into the life of
someone who is not in performance by choice but has been there much before any of us. The
students' work, wherein the empathy of the theatre actor connected with life, characters, and
through it, leading to the text, has been a serious and exciting process.Their revelations have been
brief, but intense. And like the stage, being a metaphor for life, this too is perhaps no more than
that.The performance, born of a process, shares that reﬂection.
I would like to thank all 3rd year acting and the designing students for their support and trust in
the process.
