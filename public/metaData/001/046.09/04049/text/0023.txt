As performers and as artists, it is our attempt to share our feelings and
readings of life.We learn to look at life very minutely and borrow from
it extensivelyTo be able to convince our audience and help them live
every moment of a story is usually our challenge. But this time the task
put in front of us was a little different. Not only were we to present the
story but also to devise it.
We worked over a duration of 47 days.With no text but some case
studies and an entirely diverse reality to comprehend, it felt like an
unachievable task. So began our journey into the life of the Bedin
community through research material, live performances,interactions
and video documents. So far we had worked on the skill to explore life
through a text, but what we needed to do now was to create a life and
then create a text.
Focusing on characterization, creating and speaking a text that was
truly our own, understanding and applying our classroom exercises,
collaborating and borrowing from each other, we put together scenes
and images that seemed unreal while they were being conceived, but
which brought us a step closer to the reality of a performer's life. Be it
the concept of displacement (the only constant in their life), their
struggle for survival or an identity, we felt connected at several levels.
While some of us, by adorning the female persona got in touch with
our feminine sides, others realised how silence becomes a very
important form of expression. Everyday we ﬁnd ourselves adding,
subtracting and rediscovering elements that help us strengthen our
journeys.

Our process however has not ended here.We have re—learnt what it
means to create together and find ourselves growing and maturing
everyday.
