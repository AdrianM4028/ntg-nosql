Bertolt Bcevlif
Born in Augsburg, poet, playwright and theatre director, Bertolt Brecht (1898-1 956)

shot to fame with Die Dreigroschenoper (The Three Penny Opera), an adaptation of
Gay's The Begga r's Opera. | n 1 91 8 he wrote his first full—length play, Baal, in response
to an argument in one of Kutscher's drama seminars, initiating a trend that persisted
throughout his career of creative activity that was generated by a desire to counter
another work (both others' and his own, as his many adaptations and re-writes
attest). "Anyone can be creative", he quipped, "it's rewriting other people that's a
challenge". In 1924 Brecht worked with novelist and playwright Lion Feuchtwanger
on an adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II, that proved to be a milestone
in his early theatrical and drarnaturgical development. Brecht's Edward II
constituted his first attempt at collaborative writing and was the first of many classic
texts he was to adapt. As his first solo directorial début, he later credited it as the
germ of his conception of 'EpicTheatre‘.
Until 1933 Brecht’s work was particularly concerned with encouraging audiences
to think rather than identify, and with experimentation in epic theatre and
alienation effects. His modernist concern with drama—as-a-medium led to his
refinement of the 'epic form' of the d rarna. Brecht hoped to 're—function' the theatre
to a new social use. In this regard he was a vital participant in the aesthetic debates
of his era—particularly over the 'high art/popular culture' dichotomy.
After his return to East Berlin in 1948, his directorial work on plays with the Berliner
Ensemble firmly established his influence as a major figure in twentieth century
theatre.
