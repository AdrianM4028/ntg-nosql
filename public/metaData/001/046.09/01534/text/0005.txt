——-—I take pleasure in beutiful women and I love the desire that
comes from the sight of th-cm as they laugh and move in
plays and seduce men and are taken by them. For then I feel
that 1 am a man and mighty in sex.
—What’s the good of feeling desire at the sight of beautiful
women as they laugh and seduce men and are taken by

them and feeling that you are a man and mighty in sex if a
rcd~hot lump of iron hits you and blots you out of life
and the world?
-—But I loathe whatever is degrading and disparaging and

I

feel mys:lf raised to a higher plane by the nobility immanent in the plays of the great masters; I love whatever is
lofty and improving, such as makes me sense the might of
a God and the existence of a just power.
——What’s the good of being raised to a higher plane by nobility

and feeling the might of a God and the existence of a just
Power if a red-hot lump of iron hits you and blots you out

of life and the world?
~—Why do you have to go on repeating the same words in an?

.

swer to all I ve been saylng about the beautiful and elevating
things in the plays of the great masters?
-—Because you too can get caught up like

that man in

Bert

Brecht’s play so as to blot out your name and your self and
your home and your wife and your memory, your

laughter

and your passion, your desire for women and your elevation to God; because you too can be lined up like that man

in a formation one hundred thousand strong, between man
and man, dinner pail and dinner pail, just as millions of
men have been lined up in the past and millions of mm will
be lined up in the future; because like that man you too can
be hit by a red-hot lump of iron and blotted out of life
and the world !!!

”shouting : ()h now

realise that it’s a good play and its mo—

ral one to be taken to heart.
