DIALOGUE ABOUT BERT BRECH’I"S PLAY
Man equals Man
—Where have you been to put you in such a bad mood and

—I've been to Bert Brecht’s play Man equals Man and it's a

—-—What’s the good of being surrounded

by

moving or de-

lightful things and clean well-dressed people if a red-hot

of iron hits you and blots you out of life and the world ?

——-The plays I like are those that speak of the delights of
Nature, of the freshness of springtime and the rushing of the

wind through the trees in summer, of the pale sky in April
and the last blossoms in autumn.
