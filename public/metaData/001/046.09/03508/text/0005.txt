ABOUT THE PLAY
The protagonist of the play is Hori, a poor
farmer who loans a cow from his friend
Bhola. Hori's two brothers Heera and
Sobha have taken against each other due
to a division in the property. Out of spite
Heera poisons the cow and Kills it. Hori's
wife doubting Ileera accuses him of the
nnsdeed.
Alongside the widowed daughter of
Heera, Jhuniya bears the seed of Gobar,
son of Hori. Out of fear he runs away from
the village. Jhuniya lands up at Hori's
house. Bhola finds the whole event
disagreeable.
He proposes, that he is willing to forego
the price of the cow if Jhuniya is sent
away from the house. When Dhaniya and
Hori refuse to do so, Bhola takes away
thei r two oxen.
A meeting ofthe village elders is called to
decide on Jhuniya’s case. Hori is fined.
Dhaniya protests.
A road construction begins in the village.
Hori begins to work there but gradually
his health begins to deteriorate.

DIRECTOR'S NOTE
For many years I have been deeply
concerned about the absence of any
serious discourse in the media, arts or in
theatre about the Indian villages. It has
intrigued me, particularly. When one
starts getting to know that Indian farmers
are cornmiting suicide in thousands
across the country, due to draughts,
indebtedness or due to not being able to
re-paytheir loans no artforrn can afford to

ignore.

I

Directing Godaan of Prernchand is a
reminder and a coution for all those
citizens living in Urban India to
understand the rural people of India. For
students of N80 who are performing this
great work of literature, it is to sensitize
their conscience to understand their own
people closely.
In this performance we have also
included two famous short stories of
Prernchand Thakur Ka Kuan and Kafan in
order to give a touch of sharper etching to
our presentation.
