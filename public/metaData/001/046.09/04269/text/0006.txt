George S Kaufman

The Playwrights
The playwright duo of George S Kaufman and Moss Hart
took the American commercial theatre of Broadway by
storm with a string of comedic writing in the 19305.
Both sons of first generation Jewish immigrants, both
were acclaimed playwrights and directors in their own
right. Kaufman in particular was an iconoclastic figure

whose career seemed to match the rise and fall of .
comedy on Broadway. As a writer, director, drama
reporter and editor, and a play doctor par ex'cellence,
his sharp sense of wit and humour enabled him to churn out a string of
pieces that were not only commercial successes but also held up a mirror to
the foibles of American society and its institutions
during the Depression and the inter-war years. in
addition to his reputation as an American wit, he
brought a sense of economy and solid craftsmanship
to his work, and his plays have served as models of

३ comic construction for the stage, film and television.
' His works include the first Pulitzer—prize winning
musical 0f Thee / Sing,

Cocoanuts and Animal

Crackers for the Marx Brothers, and the smash hit
musical Guys and Dolls.
Moss Ha rt
Although frequently over—shadowed by the much-lionised Kaufman, Moss
Hart's contribution to Broadway has been no less. He was pulled out of the
obscurity of amateur theatricals when a producer insisted he revise a script
with the already established Kaufman; thus began a fruitful decade of
collaboration between the two. Apart from these , playwriting
collaborations, Hart also a great measure of success as a director, especially
of musicals like Camelot and the original production of My Fair Lady which
won him a Tony award for best Director.
But some of the best work of both Kaufman and Hart lay in their eight
collaborative efforts. These were not only commercial successes, but
received critical acclaim as well, like The Man Who Came To Dinner and the

Pulitzer prize winning You Can 't Take It With You.
