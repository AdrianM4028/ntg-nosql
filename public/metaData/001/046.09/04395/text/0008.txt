Regarding the play, I would only like to say that “JAYAZ HATTYARE” offers so much challenge to its
actors that its amazing. The very basic situation of the play is an extremely dramatic one and then the
characterisation — their contrasts, their obsessions, their passion, their relationship, their agonies and
their ecstacies — everything is amazing.
I
In the casting of the production, I have very consciously tried to give a chance to all student—actors,
specially to those ones who felt that they were not given their due in the course of their training in
NSD till now. I strongly feel that the actor who do not have a typically exhibitionistic personality,
remain unnoticed but can show amazing results if given a chance.

This is also very important because it is through these untapped actors that we come across new ways
of expressions in acting which might look more inspiring and more convincing than even the best that
we have seen or done in our life.
Selection of “The Just Assassins” was a very impulsive decision taken by me and the students involved,
bOth in an equally sudden and dramatic manner. This has been one of the dearest plays that I had
directed for “Sambhav” in early eighties.
Through my life and work, specially of last 20 years or so, I can say, that theatre for me is mainly a
strong text and equally strong and convincing acting. And direction for me is trying my best to bring
them as close to each other as possible and in perfect harmony. As an actor also, I always aspire to be
as much at ease with my character as humanly as possible and I have tried to instill the same in my
students/actors during the making of this play.
It is an unending process for me and I know, it can not be achieved in one play, but if I' can even
slightly channelize my actors towards the attitude while prepairing a role, I think I have done my job
and have earned a restful sleep for the night.
