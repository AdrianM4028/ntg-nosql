The play is about rebellion against tyranny and it was intended by Camus to possess a relevance to
contemporary European politics. This adaptation explores the same issues in the pre-independence
Indian scenario. It is centered upon the assassination of the British Governor. The hero of the play is
the man who throws the bomb. He was held back at his first attempt on seeing that the Governor was
accompanied by his nephew and niece. Two days later, however, the Governor was alone and the
protagonist kills him. He made no attempt to escape, was arrested, tried and executed. All this happens
offstage. The whole play, spread over ﬁve acts, is set in the room which the small band of assassins have
rented, the execution follows Act 4 takes place in prison, the day after the assassination, where the
protagonist is Visited by the chief of police and the widowed governor’s wife. It is a stringent, tightly
controlled attempt at modern tragedy. The play is in the essentials of its plot, historical and speciﬁc.
But continuously assails us with the problem ofjustification ofviolence; in its most universal application
against injustice. And is intimate with compassion and distress for its passionate votaries.
