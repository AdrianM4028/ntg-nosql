I am convinced about what Pirandello states
about life, illusion and reality. It was difficult
to understand him and thats why he interested me.
With whatever I've learnt in the N.S.D. and
with the informations and discussion that kept
on pouring I've made an attempt to understand
Pirandello & in turn made the audience understand
him.

The attempt is this result before you in
this production " AT THE EXIT ".
