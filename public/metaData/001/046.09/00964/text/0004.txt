WHAT PIRANDELLO SAYS ABOUT LIFE ?
”I think life is a very sad piece of buffmonery, because
we have in us, without being able to ascertain how or why or
from whom, the need to fool ourselves continuously by the
Spontaneous creation of a reality (one for each and never the
same for everyone) that from time to time reveals itself to
be vain and illusory.
"Whoever understands the game can no longer fool himself,

but if you cannot fool yourself, you can no longer derive any
enjoyment or pleasure from life. So it goes.
