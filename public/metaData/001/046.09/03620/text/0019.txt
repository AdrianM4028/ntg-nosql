The Play

Julius Caesar
Julius Caesar is one of Shakespeare's best known tragedies. Shakespeare taken this story directly
from the annals of Roman history. Its lasting appeal can be attributed to the play's unforgettable
characters, gripping plot, revelations of human nature, universal themes and lyrical poetry. In

addition to Julius Caesar's appeal as a great story taken from a chapter in history, the play is also an
intriguing puzzle. It poses a number of problems in that it is not entirely clear who the central
character is. Some scholars even argue that the play is misnamed because the real focus of the
tragedy is on Brutus rather than Caesar. Others counter that it is Caesar and Caears's spirit that
dominate the action, and therefore it is his tragedy that unifies the play, still others suggest that the

real hero of the play is Rome itself, and the tragedy revolves around Rome's inability to remain free
of tyranny and civil strife. The play supports all of these views and others.
Shakespeare's primary source for the play was Plutarch's 'The lives of the noble Grecians and

Romans', first translated into english by Thomas North in 1579. He remained quite faithful to the
source. In fact, as so many critics have noted, in some places Shakespeare lifted entire passage of

North's prose and used almost every word in transforming them to verse. But he also introduced
much that is not Iâ€™lutarch's work. The funeral orations, are Shakespeare's as are the portrayals of
many of the minor characters.

This play appeared first in 'The first folio of 1623' as' The tragedy of julius Caesar'.
Scholars are divided as to when the play was actually written. Some place the composition date as
early as 1591 and other as late as 1596. There is an eyewittness acount of a performance of the play
on September 21, 1599. This might make it one of the first plays performed at the newly built Globe
Theatre.
