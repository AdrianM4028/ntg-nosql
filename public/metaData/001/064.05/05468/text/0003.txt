It is a matter of great pleasure to learn that Panjab Theatre Forum, Patiala is
organising a week long Drama Festival from 29th Nov. to 5th December, 1986.
Drama is a direct action, inherently mimetic, that creates an everlasting impression
on human mind and heart. Theatre is a most effective stage and forum through which
message of unity, fraternity and revolutionary social change can be brought to the door
steps of the people. It is through stage that people can learn most effectively their
lessons in the art or citizenship.
It is indeed creditable for the organisers of the Punjab Theatre Forum that they

have come in the field not only to provide entertainment but also to revive spirit of
National Unity and Social consciousness among the people, particularly in these days of
stress and strain. I wish the organisers complete success in their performances.
