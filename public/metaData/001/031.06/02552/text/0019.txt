She hated the very breath of TALOKA, her husband, but was devoted to him like
every Indian wife. The sufferings, the atrocities, the brutal treatment shs met was

with the prize bestowed by the Sarnaj. She resolved to win him over, even if she

had to take help of the most hated "bottle of liqour", And she did it and won it.
