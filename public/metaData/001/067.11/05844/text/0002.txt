D[ABADDHA
Bound By
Responsibility

SYNOPSIS
It was merely tryst with destiny for Gagan, a lorry driver,
when about 18 years ago he came across Sita, insulted and
tormented in her well-established groom’s house, desperately
trying to commit suicide with her lap-babe. Gagan hopped down
from his vehicle and saved Sita and her little baby. In course of
time, these uneven lives get emotionally locked with each other.
Tender love and affection spring spontaneously in the simple
susceptible heart of Gagan, passionately reciprocated by his

growing sensitive ‘daughter’ Jhinuk. But even then Sita could
hardly forget her former ego. And so the inevitable Nemesis

casts it appalling shadow one day. Sita, Gagan and Jhinuk have
to bleed upon the thorns of cruel realities, when Jiban, the loyal
assistant of Gagan, or Debu, betrothed to Jhinuk stand taken

aback and feel only the surface of the tragedy. A new emotion of
love and trust then ushers in from that moribund family
structure to fill the void. It matters little whether the age old
society is ready to accept the iconoclastie truth. But an
emotional response to meet the challenge of a bolder
responsibility gets the better of all obstacles.
