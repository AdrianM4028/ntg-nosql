DIRECTOR’S NOTE
A naturalistic play like ‘Diabaddha’ which has a

Chekovian undertone of psychic and emotional
feelings ofthe pivotal characters specially when

they bleed upon the thorns of cruel realities,
poses to be a rare challenge to me. The
production scheme demands an orthodox
Stanislavskian approach to deal with in all
propriety although I have not hesitated to take
liberty as and when necessary breaking the
barriers of typical methodology.
The set, light and music have been schemed in
practicable response to the realistic contents.
The set design is meant to be sur-realistic, the

music is according to the mental make up of the
play’s protagonist who retains a ﬂickering
weakness for the older songs of the golden past
and light design reﬂects the light and shades to
the dominant crisis of the play.
The acting style is meant to be realistic as well
as restrained particularly in emotionally
surcharged sequences.

PLAY WRIGHT’S NOTE
For a long time after ‘Gnan Briksher Fal’ which
dealt with a decadent feudal culture of the 19th
century Brahmo family, I had been doggedly

chasing life, chequered life of modern men—

relational problems. The SGGdS Of

men with veriegated profession and passions,
with strange behavioural patterns and

‘Daibaddha‘ WhiCh tOOK about five
years to germinate latently 011 the
ground of imagination and thoughts
backed up by prolonged study and
observations, were perhaps
procured from day to day
experiences of this sensitive on
looker who had to spend some time
amidst transport workers. The ever
enthusiast Meghnad, who actively
stood by me throughout the writing
process of this play, has efficiently
used his directional talent to set the
wheels move on the right track.
Though the play humbly claims to

be ‘Original’ in the so called sense of
the term, it is not quite unlikely that

the playwright may be vicariouly

inﬂuenced by his age old favourites
like Jagadish Gupta or
Narendranath Mitra for delivering
psycho—analytical elements in the
play.
