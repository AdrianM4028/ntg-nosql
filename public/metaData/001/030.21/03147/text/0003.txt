DIRECTOR’S N OT E
Our production is an edited and updated Hindi adaptation of Viiay Tendulkar’s classic
Marathi text of the late I 960’s. It has not been seen on the Delhi stage For quite sometime,
and it highlights the violence and sexual cornpulsions that lie iust beneath the skin of

many ot its respectable middle-class characters, making it as contemporary and relevant
now as it was then.
The play depicts a group of actors on tour, arriving at a new venue, and, with time to
kill, entering into a harmless game, a mock-trial. Kavita, an unmarried teacher, is chosen

to go on trial. The accusations against her are part-coniecture, part-hearsay, and what
begins in tun soon evolves into a savage hunt. The stage becomes a claustrophobic
prison where social masks are thrown all, and baser animal instincts are unleashed.
