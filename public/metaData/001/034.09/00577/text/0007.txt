ALIBABA is rightly called the evergreen opera of the Bengali stage.
It is a fantasy adopted from the popular episode ALIBABA Es FORTY
THIEVES from Arabian Nights.
Alibaba and Kassem were two brothers. Alibaba was poor while Kassem
was rich. Kassem had two slaves by the names of Marzina and Abdala.
Marzina was a fair looking damsel but Abdala was a dark

hubsy.

Both

of them were well- versedin dancing and singing.
Alibaba had a storke of luck as he accidently found the “Robbers Den”
where the stolen booty was preserved under a mountain- cave. Alibaba
overnight turned into a rich man and bought Marzina from his brother
Kessem after confiding with him the secret of “Open Sesame ’.
३
Kassem was killed by the robbers as he could no get out of the" den.
The robbers resolved to take revenge on Alibaba for stealing a major portion '
of their looted booty.

" \-

Marzina with the help of Abdala successfully foiled all attempts made
by the robbers on the life of Alibaba and the opera ended with a
happy
union of Marzina with Hussain, the son of Alibaba.
