KAVI is the dramatic version of a famous novel of the same name from the
pen of the celebrated writer Tarasankar.

NETAI is a village kavi with no respectable heritage.

He loved a married

girl of the neighbours and was not keen in persuing family profession of

mean acts. Instead, he wantel to be a kavi and to achive success as kavi he
centred all his thoughts and devotion.

He was misunderstood by his rela-

tion and was driven out of the home. He joined a team of JHUMUR where
he came in touch with a girl of ill-fame. He became compassionately attached to this girl and stayed with her until her very death under pathetic
circumstances.

In the end the Kavi Netai won the laurels from all quartars and was
recognised as the best among all kavials of the then time.
Netai returned back to his village and went to the spot where his first
girl- in- love was cremated to pay his homage. The pathos of the drama
will linger for a long ti me into the minds of the audience.
