This drama which may be christened as “The Captive”
is written in the form of an allegory.

(Bagh—Bandi)

Dipa and Rana, who have no children, represent the so-called modern

happy family.

Biltu is a boy confused with diverse political views.

There is an

youngrnan engrossed in class-war. When Biltu seeks asylum, the happy family
does not accept him as a member of the family. He falls a prey to the youngman
but there is no protest from any quarter.

An analysis reveals that youngmen like Biltu are inseperable parts of the
society. If the leaders of society accept the Biltus, a new society, free from
exploitation the dream of Dipa, Rana can possibly come into being.
But that is not to be. They surrender themselves to social taboos and
try to lull the Biltus into sleep, but the trumoil of political idologies make them
restless. Biltu and youngrnen like him are perturbed over one question- there are
so many ways, so many means, but which is the correct path for them to follow ?

Administration trembles on seeing the writings on the wall. Oppression is let loose
and an emasculate society stands inactive over the dead youths.
