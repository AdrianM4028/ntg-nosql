Saint Tukaram was born in low cast and according to the age old
belief of the Hindu community, Shudras (low born) had no right to write

verse, hymns etc. and

to learn or teach Vedanta.

Saint Tukararn had

ﬂouted this command of the heirarchy and was spreading the gospel of ‘Hari
Nam’, devotion to Lord Vithal or Pandurang, among the masses. Mambaji,
the self-styled Brahmin representative of the heirarchy, was opposing Tukaram
in his mission. But Saint Tukararn’s hymns and the Bhakti Marg was so

popular with the masses that Marnbaji’s efforts were always jeered at and ﬂouted
by the masses.
Mambaji invites the learned Rarneshwar Shastri Vaghulkar to sit in

judgement over Tukaram’s disobedience to the principles of Vedanta and order
him to stop composing hymns and verses. Rameshwar Shastri’s wife Janakibai
is hereself a great admirer of Saint Tukaram and his hymns.
Tukaram’s trial takes place before the learned Rameshwar Shastri who

orders Tukai am to drown the volumes of his hymns in the river Indrayani.
Tukararn does it but goes on fast unto death in the temple near river

Indrayani calling upon Lord Vithal to undo injustice.
Thereafter, a miracle

happens.

The

river

Indrayani appears

in

the

guise of a woman and returns the volumes of Tukaram’s hymns drowned in the
bed of the river, undamaged and completely dry.

These volumes are brought

even
to Saint 'I‘ukaram by his followers in a procession which is joined

by the learned Rameshwar Shastri who had earlier ordered the drowning of those
volumes.
