It was 1876.

City of Calcutta was being terroried by Mahindra, a
notorious absconding dacoit. The Police department annonnced a cash prize of
Rs. 1,000/- on his capture.
Parulbala, the daughter of Jatindranath Pal—a rich man engaged in trade
with beggers—was attracted to Mahindra. She left her father’s house and got

married with Mahindra. But she had to return to her father next morning for
want of accomodation. To take revenge her father tried to capture Mahindra.
Mahindra was a frequent visitor to Jyostna, a prostitute. Jyostna, lured
by a paltry sum of money offered by Jatindranath, helped him to arrest
Mahindra. But Mahindra was a great friend of Bata Krishna Sarkar, the
Police Chief, who incidentally happend to be the falher-in-law of Mahindra—
without his knowledge. Pritalata, the daughter of Batakrishna, helped Mahindra
to escape from the police custody.
Jatindranath became very angry with the police callousness,

again got Mahindra arressed and sentenced to death.
again released, aided by some supernatural means.
