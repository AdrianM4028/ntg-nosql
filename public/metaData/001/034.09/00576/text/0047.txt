G U I N EA- P I G
(A Play of Emergence)

By
M o h it C h otto pad h yaya
When the tentacles of imperialism spread their all encompassing authorities
in every sphere of life, the rational beings lose their human properties and
degenerate into play things to an over load.
But there is still a limit to which a human being can subjugate himself and
after that emanates a force within himself, which enables him to realize the true
essence of life. “I rebel—therefore, I am”. This realization emancipates him
from the clutches of the establishment and relieves him from playing the part
of guinea-pig to the whims of the imperialist establishment.

The tune of this play harps on this belief and what it tries to communicate
is that a rebellion with the goal for the upliftment of the general mass must
transcend into a revolution with the all-out participation of the mass.
