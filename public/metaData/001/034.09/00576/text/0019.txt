How IBM as a corporate citizen
is working towards
the country’s hopes and aspirations.
India is a country with great
expectations, marching towards a

future that offers more to more
people.

Participating in this nation-building
task is IBM. By making
India’s ﬁrst computers, it is
accelerating the nation's economy.
Making optimum use of scarce
resources and releasing locked-up
capital for productive investment.
IBM computers are helping Indian
companies win foreign markets.
More.
Computers are opening up new
careers, creating new techniques

and skills. IBM is passing on its
world-wide technological know- how
to about 400 vendors in India

to make computer-age
components. IBM India-made
equipment is also exported to
40 countries.

IBM is privileged to be involved in
the challenge of building a new
tomorrow.
