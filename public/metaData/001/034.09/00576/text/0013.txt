The bold question, the play ponders on is : "To what extent does our

seciety condone any deriliction of the values of life when purpose is predominently perceptible in the life of a person !’
Ayn Rand inspired us to this theme.

Miss Leela is on trial

In the play, a courtroom drama,

for the murder of one Mr. MadangOpal.

Madangopal ?
To the world, he was an ashtonishingly successful international tycoon,

owner of a vast ﬁnancial

empire.

Miss Leela, a God—like hero to be served with her mind, body and soul. To his
aristorcatic young wife, he was an elemental force of nature to be tamed. To

his millonaire Father-in-law he was a giant whose single error could be used to
destroy him.
But, if asked, what kind of man was he ? —we can say—It depends on,
what the society believes to be the sense of values in one’s life—the basic rules of

conduct framed by it.

up jurys

from among the audience, who give the verdict at the end.

Who is on trial in this case ‘2

It is your own soul that will be brought to

light when your decision is rendered.

The play
‘Not Guilty’.

will end on the verdict of the Jury — be it, ‘Guilty’ or
