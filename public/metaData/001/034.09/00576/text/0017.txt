Moved by the apathy of younger generation of Sindhis to their mothertongue, so much so that many of them just cannot speak one simple straight
Sindhi sentence without the admixture of a few words of Hindi or English. The
author makes his mite for keeping alive the magniﬁcent cultural heritage of

Sindhis dating back to the dawn of mankind.
The play depicts the day-to-day in life of an

uneducated orthodox elderly

Sindhi lady who is trammelled by ties of tradition and adheres tenaciously to the
old norms of life.
Her children having achieved a good position in the present society, try
their best to change her from ‘Ammi’ to ‘Mummy’ for bringing her in line with
modern world.
The events gradually work upto
succumbs to the lures of elegant living.

an interesting episode and the lady
She

literally walks out of the past,

imitates and apes a ‘Society’ lady, enjoins all and sundry to call her ‘Mem Sahib’,
moves from clubs to movie-houses, talks in half-baked and broken English and

ultimately takes to smoking and drinks too with the result that she throws
overboard her responsibilities of the household chores, including her children.

Aghast and bewldered at her behaviour, the young-ones hatch a plot to
bring her back at least within the ‘acceptable’ limits.
