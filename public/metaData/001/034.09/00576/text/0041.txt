Dr. S reenivas, the central character of the play, has been posthomously
awarded a prize by the Government for his achievements in the ﬁeld of Atomic
Physics.

But his wife, Mrs. Jayanthi Sreenivas refuses the award on the ground

which is developed in the play in ﬂash back technique.
It has been examined and explained in detail through various events that
the scientist, though sincere in his research, is trapped in a net spread by an
International Scientiﬁc Organisation. Earlier, he refused foreign scholarship but

now he cannot get rid of the charming face of Shiba, a Secret Agent of the
Organisation. Prof. Vardaraj, an assistant of the Scientist is ultimately lured by
Shiba who presses the Scientist to accept the oﬂer of a huge sum of money.

The Scientist, unwilling to bow down to the pressure of circumstances, has to
loose his life in an explosion which is designed and executed by Shiva and
Vardaraj.
