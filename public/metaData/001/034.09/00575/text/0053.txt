Stop bad breath...
fight tooth decaywith
Colgate Dental Cream

D C. G . 6 2 . 7 7

Brush your teeth with
Colgate after every meal.
It protects you just the
way dentists recommend
all over the world.
Bacteria grow in food
particles left between your
teeth. These can cause
bad odour, and later—
painful decay.
So always brush the
Colgate way right after
eating. It's proven most
effective to freshen your
breath, whiten your teeth
and fight decay.
