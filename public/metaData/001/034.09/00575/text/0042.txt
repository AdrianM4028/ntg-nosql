Thus we see that Amanda, as a mother is a loving woman and Jim whearing mem-

orable words about the importance of money and power. We know that he is speaking
not only for himself, but for the entire youth of the world. In this respect ha is a true
representative of youngmen everywhere. lnspite of this he is not free front illusion and
self deception. He claims to have know-ledge of psychology, but does not know that
mere words of advice would not solve Laura's problem. This is an instance of Jims self
deception. Allough unlike other charaters, he does not live either in post or in further,
he still seems to enjoy the sensations from such mental activity. He is almost as much
self-centred as Tom and also ignorant in the sense of lacking self knowledge. He does
not however help to bring Laura's secret life to climex.

He therefore does not impress us

much in the play.

Finally one can state that the Glass Menagerie is a cleverly manipulated play with
its delicate lexture and lypiccally pathetic tone. It has an appearance of being an original
play because it contains both the conscious and unconscious elements of its characters.
