Radha Raman Ghosh

The central figures in the play are Arjune, his wife Padma and Thako his sister-in-law.
There are various charcters and shades veering around them in a factory life with all its
implications and problems.

To some, like Haridas, the normal virtue is not a forte.

Lecherous in charcter and scheming in life, turned Bhola into a hooligan, murdered Bipin
Babu, leader of the factory union and committed many other crimes to achieve his selfish
end.

The play also has its tender moments, and amidst many twists and turns, the human

emotion manifests itself in varied circumstances, often with divastating effect.

In the end,

one comes to perennial question how to free the society from the evil splrites like Haridas.
