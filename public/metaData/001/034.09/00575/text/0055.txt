Choudhary the local board chairman of a small town receives the news that an inspector general is travelling incognito from New Delhi to inspect his administration during
emergency period. The chairman assembles his officials and leading people of the town to
plan what to do. The news terrifies them, for the town is a warren of petty corruption.
Coincidentally Mohan Kalita, a young man who has spent all his money on cards, clothes,

arrives in town and lodges at the local hotel. In their fright the town officials assume that
Mohan Kalita must be the government inspector in disguise and present themselves to him.
Taking advantage of their mistake, Mohan Kalita moves into the chairman's house

and accepts bribes from panchayat member, block deveIOpment officers, Headmaster, the
town council and the local businessmen who come to complain about these officials. He
even court the chairman's willing wife and proposes to the chairman's daughter. Finally
tiring of the deception, Mohan Kalita hires a taxi to take him on his way, promismg
to return the next day to claim his bride.

Meanwhile, the inquisitve local post master has

opened a letter Mohan Kalita has written describing his adventures in the corrupt, ridiculous
town, and at the prewedding gathering the postmaster reveals the swindle. As recrlmrnations begin to fly, a policeman enters to announce the arrival of the real inspector and to

summon everyone to his presence.
