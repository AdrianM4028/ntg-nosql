TRUTIYA PRUTHIBI
By
Prof Kartika Chandra Rath
We cling to the charter of humanity and proclaim ourselves as human beings on
this earth. Our pursuit is eternal - from ’a' to infinity, from zero to indeterminant. Vanquished on the chequered board of life, we have left behind us a few worlds of our creation.
They may be “DWAPARA” may be “TRETAYA”,

........................

This world - where we are chasing the golden dear, we are eternally aflairns amidst
dejection, despondence, pretensions, deceit and treachery, - beneath a mask of culture,
civilisation. religion, art, language and descipline. We, the social animals are under persistant stress and strain, enclaved by the chains of conventional social regulations. We are
perpetually engaged in an unholy competition for a flase glamour, a hollow fashion and a
dead logic. Hope, aspiration, dream, desire and love are all here, like the golden deer - a
receding mirage.

Is this the ’TRUTYA PRUTHIBI'? Is this the ”THIRD WORLD" ???
