Problems of extraordinary nature surrounds Sivakarni - the pious lady
of the house headed by the sentiment filled old blind man - her father-inlaw. Sivakarni's husband Somu goes behind the bars on some fictitious
and false allegations just to save the prestige and image of his hypocrat
friend—cum-employer Mohan. Somu is rather faintly in the mind of his
eight year old daughter Uma just as a father, as she never had a chance to
see him since her birth but longing is there in her tender heart to see her
father.
Mohan, prompted by his wornanising nature, works to take undue
advantage of the situation prevailing around Sivakarni and he leads the
blind old man under wrong affirmations motivated by bad intentions.
The truth of Somu’s imprisonment is being fabricated otherwise to his
father that Somu had gone to, Ceylon for earning a lot for the family's
betterment in the future. The same story is repeated for the society in
which they live including Sambandhi Saval shanrnugarn who had married
his younger son to Somu’s sister Radha.

Rajalingam - jailmate of Somu escapes from the jail and comes to
Somu’s house on his nomadic way with the news that Somu is to be released scott free within a few days. Though wild by nature, Rajalingam
is netted with in the walls of love and affection being experienced by him
in the house of Somu. Circumstances compel him to act as Somu, so that
the grieved blind father has his son back and the tender heart which had
been longing to see her father fulfills its urge. l n the process of doing

good in his own way to the family of Somu, Rajalingam loots the shop of
Moha’n in order to fulfill the commitments that are pressurising Sivakarni.
And similar sacrifices go on and on but ends with the death of Rajalin-

gam there by the onward journey of the family is set smooth bearing in
their hearts the memory of Rajalingam.
