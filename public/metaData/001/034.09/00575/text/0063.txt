RAJANIGANDHA would apparently appear to be a drama on the life story of an
unsuccessful film actress, a frustrated film director and a dreaming professor.

In fact the

playwright was inspired with the personal essay on Dream Children by Charles Lamb._
In this essay Lamb’s own life was narrated to some extent.

Due to family difficulties

Lamb himself could not marry but he used to dream of a wife and children.

In the drama

RAJANIGANDHA the role of the Professor represents Charles Lamb.

The drama is played on ONE SET and divided into for scenes.

At the end of first

scene there will be break for three minutes for changing costumes but the auditorium will
remain dark. At the end of second scene there will be interval for 10 minutes. After third
scene there will be a break for three minutes and then the final scene.
