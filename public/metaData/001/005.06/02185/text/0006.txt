RAILWAY WAGONS
With the start of our Wagon Factory

at

Panki, Kanpur, we

have completed the Proto-type and are commencing the bulk
production of B. G. Covered Railway Wagons now on order
for the Indian Railways.
This new venture will meet the Railway’s growing needs for
Rolling Stock and will help in quick movement of products of
the Indian Industries developing so fast under the 5-year plans.
The country’s foreign exchange resources used in purchase of
wagons abroad will thus be saved for utilisation in other spheres.

Another of our humble contribution to National Development.
