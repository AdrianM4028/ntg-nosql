Delhi has still not achieved adulthood in theatre. Out of a population of nearly
ten million hardly a few thousand are frequent theatre goers. Somehow it has not reached
all levels of people and remain basﬁaHy/alimited middle class phenomenon. There is
no broad based cultural movement involving wide strata of people. Unless strenuous
efforts are made in educational institutions from the beginning to inculcate broad based
culture, there is little hope of improvement. Another tendency to deplore is holding
free shows. Big ads appear in newspapers asking people to collect their passes at the

gate.
The other great problem is of theatre halls. To book a good theatre hall, booking
has to be done months in advance with full payment. And there are so few of them.
Rents are rocketing sky high.
This time we are presenting Mein Aur Woh, a musical drama unfolding the

destinies of two girls.
