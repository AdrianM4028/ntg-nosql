A note by the author
I.

After partition I came to Delhi as a refugee from Lahore. Due to my old association with Kashmir I was

called by the Kashmir Authorities to help organise their cultural front. I had seen the awakening of
Kashmir at its best.
It was in 1951 I again stepped into Delhi to settle down here with Hali, my life companion.

When I plunged into the Delhi theatre ﬁeld, it was a glorious experience. The birth ofmusicals! Whatjoy!
From creation to the bubbling response of the audiences and operas. Digging into the history and the

present milieu communicating with the audiences on various themes connected with theirjoys and sorrows
was just tremendous. But why could not this extremely popular form of theatre be institutionalised?
Decades I have spent in theatre, but where is theatre today? Instead ofmore and more facilities for theatre
movement, nooses around the neck have squeezed its life. In good old days too one has always struggled

but today the conditions have become suffocating . . . what financial and other constraints! N0 joy to put up
a play! !

Coming to Mein Aur Woh, this is my twenty ninth offering to my audiences. It is based on my life
experiences. The hopes belied. The dreams crushed. The backward social customs crushing society etc.
etc. The women in spite of laws and legislation still remain a fake coin in human treasury. The Earth,
Zulmat qada! How long will it bear these miseries?

The place presentation has been a unique experience. Stark realities of life hit you in the head. How long?
How long? To portray them, no trimmings were required. No fanfare of sets and other contraption. Let
the actors speak through their portrayal. It is at your door - the door ofjudgement.
