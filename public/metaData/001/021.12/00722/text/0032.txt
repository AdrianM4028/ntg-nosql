Philips
computerised
message switching
system for
INDIA
METEOROLOGICAL
DEPARTMENT
For speedy collection and
dissemination of an
enormous volume of
meteorological data
(approximately 5 million
5 figure groups per day)
the Regional
Telecommunication Hub,
New Delhi, will be using the
Philips DS-714 system as its
‘Nerve-centre’ under the
World Weather Watch
Programme organised by
the World Meteorological
Organisation.
The DS-714 systems are
computer based systems
designed to achieve high
efficiency and utmost

reliability in the control of
Telecommunication
networks. These systems
strike the optimum balance
between hardware and
software, as they are
designed solely for

telecommunications rather
than following the usual
approach of suppliers by
taking general-purpose
hardware and software
and adapting it to
telecommunication uses.
Philips is in the forefront of
communication technology
for more than half a century.
This unique experience is
pooled in irnagineering

(engineering with
imagination) computers
for communication.
The excellence of 08-714
is well proven. Whether it is
the mammoth “Weather
Switch" at Kansas city
(USA) or a small message
switcher at Kinshasa (Zaire),
the [38-714 is there,
for better communication.
A system designed today

to meet tomorrow's needs.

Philips is proud to be
associated with the World
Weather Watch Programme
and India Meteorological
Department in this project.
In Telecomrnunications,
the equipment produced by
Philips include radio
communication and
navigational aids,
telephones and exchanges,
multiplex and transmission
systems for telephones and
television channels,
telegraph and data
tra nsm i 55 io n /swi tc h in g,
automatic air/ground traffic
control, military
telecornrnunications, and a
wide variety of advanced
complementary products
