poetry for weaving good deeds. Charkha in Sulagde Darya is important for Jagiraan to spin
for her dowry. Otherwise she can’t please anyone — not even her husband.
His exposure of religious bigots, their exploitation of the poor makes one wonderstruck. No mincing of words. What outspokenness ! The truth, conviction and his
beliefs didn‘t make him diplomatic. He was forthright, hammered the nail on the head. His
love for God is supreme. But how can you love God unless you love human beings because
God loves man, so it is said. I chose two human beings Jagiraan and Gulzar as central
characters and who became victims of social injustice.
To build up situations I have used extensively Bulle Shah—over 40 pieces from his
poetry, supplemented by Shah Hussain, Farid, Mira, Ihsan Rahi, Iben Insha, folk songs and
my own compositions. All in all there are over 70 sung pieces. I purposely did not stick to
poets of Bulle Shah’s times or prior to him. A theme like this-poets of all times have sung its
various facets.
The bulk of music particularly of Bulle Shah’s poems, 40 out of 70 tunes have been
composed by Safdai Hussain Khan of Pakistan.
The music having been composed, as ever it is a herculian job to ﬁnd singer actors.
With Madanbala Sindhu and V.M. Badola as central characters—others dustered round them
to build up the theme. Snehalata Sanyal‘s return to her own theatre has been gratifying.
