Safdar Hussain Khan
Oneaagain we have the privilege of having Safdar Hussain Khan among us.
Nephew
of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and a renowned thumri and ghazal singer, he specially
came from
Lahore to compose the music of Bulle Shahâ€™s poems. Highly cooperative and open
to
suggestions and new ideas, it was a creative joy to work with him.
He did composition with
sensitivity to the mood and dramatic situations. We acknowledge
with warmth and
gratitude his contribution.
