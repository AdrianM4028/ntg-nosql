CHANN BADLAN DA ,
(MOON

OF

THE

CLOUDS)

Delhi Art Theatre’s latest oﬁering is a musical Chann Radian Da (Moon
of the Clouds) b.1sed on the folk-songs of the Punjab. The script and direction is
by Sheila Bhatia, the author of its previous operas.
The musical is a new experiment. Over 50 folk-songs of the Punjab have
been woven together to make the script. The links are provided by verses written

by Sheila Bhatia.

She also uses song, dance, mime and recitation in the musical.

The author was moved to produce this item because she felt deeply that the
new generation was losing touch with its own traditions, that vulgarisation was
setting in in the use of folk-songs and dances, and that disintegration was gradually
creeping into the fabric of the life of the people of the Punjab.

Charm

Badlan Da, symbols

of the living tradi

tion of the Punjab, cast a look back into the pages of history and gather newstrength through folk-songs which sing of the joys and sorrows of the life of the
people before it moves forward to face the hazards of time.
