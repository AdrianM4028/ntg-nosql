as the basis of his lyrics. The script includes scenes mostly designed on the
basis of Bharat
Ratna Bhargav’s Radio play ‘Panchali Shapath’.
Kaljayi who is an embodiment of the spirit of woman has been created to ﬂow
through
the stream of times. She watches with her compatriots the injustice done to woman and
one
of them becomes Draupadi to see her own image in the mirror of times to come.
‘Draupadi’ deals with stark reality of life. There is no dependence on miracles or
supernaturalisrn to ﬁnd an easy way out in face of complex situations.
In the production no rigidity is maintained history-wise regarding the expression of
ideas through music, dance, sets and costumes We have tried to catch the ﬂavour of times
as nothing much is available pictorially or architecturally of this period unlike Mahenjo Daro
or Harrapa.
