Tara is married.

For a while she is taken in by the afﬂuence of her husband’s f'amily.

Rounds of cocktail and bridge parties. But the spark is not yet dead in Tara. She gets fed up
with this futile and empty life. She knows her husband is using her to advance hlS
business interests. Later her husband, has no time for her. He neglects her totally.
He is too busy making money. He ﬂirts with whoever comes his way, but sees red if
friends pay attention to Tara.

His jealousy knows no bounds.

He throws out of his

house his dearest friend when he sees I‘ara leaning on his shoulder in a moment of great
distress. For Tara all the jewels and pearls have lost their lustre. She is empty inside
and outside. Her past dreams haunt her. but by now she is reduced to nothing. Roshni
exhorts her to break her shackles if She has any shame or dignity left in her. But Tara is a
bird in a golden cage. She can only ﬂutter. The empty lives of Tara and KiShOre contiﬂue—

without meaning, without hope.
