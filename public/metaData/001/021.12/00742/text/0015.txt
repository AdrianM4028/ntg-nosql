He questions suffering and with it also his
love. The tormented poet feels
that love alone is neither all ecstacy nor
the last word on sorrow. He tells
Malika not to expect of him the love that
he had bestowed on her earlier.
when the pure ecstacy of loving and bein
g loved was enough and complete in
itself. When the intense emotional manifestat
ions of love were not distracted
by the cognizance of the millions who suffer
innocently in umpteen way.
For Meher he says,

“Even if you would become mine
The miseries of the world would be still along
The bonds of pain cruelty and disdain
Would break not by my cry alone...
Why not own the miseries of the world
And then realize the dreams we own ...”

Malika can not comprehend all these changes in
her beloved. She feels
robbed of her love. She is sad. The poet and
Malika are sitting together
unhappy in their own different ways, she at her
personnal disappointment and

he at the miseries of the world and his own helplessness.
F'akira sings,

“Let someone tell us the secret of happiness and
show the path to
peace...”

No. it is no where near.

Come partition and the holocaust and the migration of million
s from
their hearths and homes,

Men, women and children are killed mercilessly for

the religion they profess. Malika also understands this misery
. Lost and forlorn
amidst all this chaos and bloodshed, she clings to the beheaded doll
she ﬁnds
abandoned by a ﬂeeing child.

The poet is in jail. He is imprisoned with the charge of being a part of
a consriiracy to topple the government. He wonders
“In the shadow of centuries of repression and strife
What all the descendents of Adam and Eve suffered
In the every day battle of life and death
How much are we going to go through
What not the ancestors have suffered...”
