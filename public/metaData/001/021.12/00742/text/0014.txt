Kabira, Rangini, Changu and Swaran belong to Fakira’s family. They
earn their living by singing to the people, Fakira is the philospher of the busti.
His songs express the pain and suffering of all those whom he has loved, lived
with so long and known so well.

Two locales are functioning simultaneously. Aftab though annoyed is
waiting for Meher. Poet is busy writing. Meher ﬁnding Aftab very sad pleads to
him to not to be unhappy, “One never knows if one may see tomorrow again.
He should stop worrying and thinking of the life slipping by. Seeing her pale
and sad, Aftab forgets everything and takes her in his arms, “May you never

suffer as I do,” says he.
“May that moment never come
When during long lonely nights
You too ask for peace...”

Meher feels the torment of poet’s thoughts and feelings. She runs away
from Aftab, from herself. Aftab does not understand it. He follows her.
Malika has ﬁnally made up her mind to declare her love to the, poet.
Seeing Aftab and Malika going away she comes to the poet and ﬁnds him
writing the last letter to Meher. Malika sings to him,

“I have hidden the secret of my life
and burnt my heart over it.”

The poet extends his hand to Malika, appreciates her love for him and
apologizes for all the past lapses, on his part.

Alas ! only if suffering were only those of love. Busti is burnt down by
the goondas of Siyaram Chaudhari to teach them a lesson for their deﬁance
and

refusal to work for the landlord. All run towards the ﬁre and taking
advantage
of this confusion two goondas rape Nanni.

The poet comes to know of it all.

These incidents are the beginning of a

churning in his sensitive mind and soul. He is gripped with the eternal
existential questions of What is happening to people around him and why ? What
is his role in this world ? What can he do about all this
suffering ? His poetry
changes.

“ The beautiful ﬁelds that are bursting at seams
g row 0 n l y h u n ger .
Why am I always so sad ‘2”
