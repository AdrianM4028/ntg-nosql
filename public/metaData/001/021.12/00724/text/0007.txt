Ultimately this unconquerable spirit was beaten and humbled by his own son Salim
who rebelled against him to capture the throne. Salim played into the hands of reactionary
and hostile elements. The Mullahs and Shaikhs used Salim to demolish Akbar’s dreams.
Akbar had fought them for a long time. But his son’s treachery proved too much for
him.
A reign which began with so much promise ended on a despondent note. The writer
has interpreted this chapter of India’s history and has moulded characters in her own way
but keeping in view the main historical facts.

BUL LE SHAH
Our next production will be Awaz-e Haq in Punjabi. Awaz-e Haq is the musical
drama based on the life and works of Bulle Shah, the saint poet of Punjab. Bulle
Shah condemned the tyranny of the nobles, kings, mullahs and pandits towards
the
downtrodden in the villages of Punjab.

He also raised his voice against the oppressors like

Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah Abdali. In fact his ﬁght was against all
those who
committed dacoities and murders in villages and towns of Punjab,
whose Mughal
Governors were too weak and cowardly to keep law and order and to collect
land tax from
the landlords. The musical drama will also deal with the period of
Alam Gir and Bulle
Shah’s views on the professional Mullas and Pandits.
