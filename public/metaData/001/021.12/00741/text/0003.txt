What the Critics Said :

. . . . Anyone who had the privilege of attending the first performances of “HEER
RANJHA”...must have come away with the
conviction that this in fact will remain a milestone both in the history of lndian drama and
of Indian opera.
. . . . Most moving and most admirable presentation as well as creation seen for many
years in Delhi. Even without a knowledge of
the Punjabi language anyone can follow....
