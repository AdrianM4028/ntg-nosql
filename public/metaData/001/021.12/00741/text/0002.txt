An opera by
SHEILA BHATIA
Revival of “l--lEER-RANJl--lA”——-an opera by
Sheila Bhatia at the Fine Arts Theatre, New
Delhi from the l3th to l9th October, I957
will be met with great interest by the public
here. The sets and some costumes will be
completely new. This opera achieved phenomenal success when presented on the Delhi
stage last season. The critics and the public
acclaimed it as a momentous event. The
overwhelming response to it should be
evidentfrom the fact that it ran for two
weeks to packed houses.
The theme of the opera is based on
Waris Shah's great classical romantic epic
of the same

name.

Though

the

original

versions of “l--leer-Ranjha” are usually intoned
in a single uniform tone, the author in this
opera has used nearly seventy different folk
tunes. To depict different moods and emotions, so necessary in characterisation and
building of an approPriate atmosphere, the
author has not only used the existing folk
tunes but also composed her own in order
to develop the plot situation and characters
of her opera.

The play of human emotions

brought out so effectively in
