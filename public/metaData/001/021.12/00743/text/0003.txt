In all these major productions training formed an integral part for
artists whether they were actors, singers or technicians. Many raw hands
became proﬁcient in their crafts through this training. Some of them are big
names in the cultural world.
Since the later half of 1976 the group, in recognition of its distinctive
service to theatre, was selected for ﬁnancial assistance by the Department

of Culture, Government of India. Under that scheme NADIR SHAH was
the ﬁrst presentation. It is a great help and the group wholeheartedly welcomes
it.

But the group hopes that the authorities would realise that the kind of

meaningful and ambitious operas and musical plays that we produce need much
more solid ﬁnancial backing to sustain it so that this beautiful and powerful
genre is properly sustained.
Nadir Shah is a magniﬁcent presentation of history.

It was followed by

another ambitious musical drama Yasmin based on Lorca’s famous play Yerma.

This play attained great heights in acting and production values. Then we
performed Mrs. Shanti Mehrotra’s Hindi play “Thera Hua Pani”. This deals

with ‘the plight of a middle class family ruled by the authoritative hand of the
father.

Jugni, an original folk musical drama based on
Pothwar ‘(West Punjab) performed last year was yet
musical theatre. It showed the development of ideas and
which are affected by new tensions and changing socio
followed by Jeewan-Ki-Hai, an opera based on the poetry

the folk melodies of
another landmark in
songs in that region
conditions. This was
of Bhai Vir Singh.

Last month Dard Ayega Dab-e Paon, a musical drama by Shiela Bhatia
based on the poetry of Faiz Ahmed Faiz was performed. It was a very difﬁcult
and challenging production. It created a stir and was played to packed houses.
And now a straight play in Hindi Mitro Marjani written by Krishna Sobti and
directed by B.M. Shah.
