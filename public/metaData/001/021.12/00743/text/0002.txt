Delhi Art Theatre needs no introduction for its original and meaningful
contribution in promoting and enriching theatre. Its productions have been
acclaimed not only in Delhi but also in almost all major cities and towns of
India and beyond. Particularly in the ﬁeld of operas and musical dramas the
group under the direction of Sheila Bhatia has carved a unique and unrivalled
place for itself. It is gratifying to note that those who till recently scoffed
at this genre are enthusiastically adopting or attempting to introduce music
and dance in their plays. We can take legitimate pride as the innovaters
and creators of this movement as we always believed that Indian theatre, if
it has to take ﬁrm roots cannot do without integrating song, dance and drama
based on indigenous forms but adopting modern techniques.
Call of the Valley was our ﬁrst attempt in this genre. It was followed
by Rukhe-Khet which attained a larger measure of integration in its musical
form.

'

From these ﬁrst steps emerged the Opera, Heer Ranjha, which solidly laid
the foundation of a modern and at the same time indigenous form of opera. It
was acclaimed as a landmark in theatre by the critics and the public alike.

The opera Prithviraj Chauhan followed. It captured the spirit of 12th
century India. lt was hailed as a very bold experiment which portrayed diverse
moods and situations through haunting melodies and thunderous choruses.

After this opera followed Chann Badlan Da which again acclaimed as
a unique musical incorporating the best in folk music with the best in stage
craft.

Ghalib Kaun Hai broke new ground by presenting a musical in Urdu.
The combination of verse, prose. music and chorus lent it colour and charm. It
achieved universal acclaim and solidly laid the foundations of a new type of
musical drama.

Next the group presented Jaan-e Ghazal, again .a musical in Urdu. This
musical depicts the evolution of Ghazal from Amir Khusro. to . the present day.
The idea that Ghazal cannot capture serious thought IS belied by this musrcal.

This was followed by Kissa Yeh Aurat Ka—Hawwa-se-Hippie Tak. The
theme is Indian women, from ancient times .to the modern. .It is not a .panegyric
to Indian women, but depicts the stark reality behind the Silken curtain.
