army was faction-ridden and leaderless. The stalwarts—the Hindu Rajputs—whom
Akbar forged by his wise and conciliatory policy into a mighty alliance—were
alienated by Aurangzeb and those who followed him. There was a time when
these valiant Rajputs guarded the frontiers from Khyber Pass to Chittagong.
But not any more.

Before the play was written a thorough search for authenticity, colour,
anecdotes aud incidents was made of the available material on that period, This
includes such diverse authors as James Fraser, L. Lockhart, William Irvine, Percival Spear, Dargah Quli Khan, Khushal Chand, Hasan Azad, Dr. Mohd. Umar,
Ghulam Hussain Taba-tavbai, Dr.

Mohd. Hasan, Sana-ul-Haq and others. A

most valuable source of information were the poets of that period particularly
Mir and Sauda. They throw a penetrating light on the events. Many of their
compositions are being used in the play.

Since Nadir Shah was the instrument whizh exposed the “gorgeous corpse”
that was the Mughal Empire the play is named after him.
