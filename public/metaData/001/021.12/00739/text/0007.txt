The very fact that Pothwar folk songs talk of ships, planes, German
atrocities besides love, separation, drought and want explain the development
of ideas and songs which are affected by new tensions and changing socioconditions.
Incidentally the span of melodies in Jugni is upto the Second World War.
We have used Ô¨Åfty eight songs out of which four had to be written to provide
the necessary links. Twenty one songs with notations were used, The tunes
of remaining thirty seven songs were composed anew. The mood was dictated
by the words of the songs and the situation. I composed new tunes keeping
in mind the general characteristics of Poth war music. The last phase of the music
was composed under the stren of a personal tragedy. Kajal Ghose was of great
help while I deciphered the notations in the book and composed new tunes.

Afzal Parvez has described the land, people and situations in Urdu while
melodies he collected are in Punjabi. His main aim is not only to preserve
these melodies and dances but to widen their appeal. Keeping the same aim
in View I have kept the same pattern and used Hindustani for linking pieces.

If Afzal Parvez were to see JUGNl, I hope he will think that I have
tried to take his message forward.
