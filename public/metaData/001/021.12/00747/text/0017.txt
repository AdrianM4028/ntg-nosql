NADIR S HA H

The play takes place during 1737-1739 and depicts time and life of the
period just before and after Nadir Shah’s invasion of India.

ACT I
Scene 1
It shows the ultimate degradation of the Mughal Empire foun—

ded by the valiant Babar and great Akbar—how kings were made
by the self seeking and villainous nobles who now wielded actual
power. Mohd. Shah's mother, Nawab Qudsia, is very much afraid
that her own son may be killed. It comes as a great relief to her to
find that Syed Brothers who were the real king-makers at that time

had selected Mohd. Shah for the throne as their pawn.

Scene 2
Shows the life of common people in a Basant Mela which has
all the attractions; singing, jokes, anecdotes. It reflects a rich but

decadent pattern of life.

It is here that court dancer Nishat has a

rendevouz with her lover lVlunnawar.

Scene 3

Mohd. Shah’s Court. The court is divided into factions and
each faction pulls the king away from the other. Debauchery

dissensions, rivalries, jealousies were the hall mark of court
Treachery was in the air. The king surrounded by psycophants
no time for the affairs of the country and that at a time when
country is facing great external danger. Give him women, wine

life,
has,
the
and

song and his world is complete. l--lis favourite singer is Nurbai and
he has his lacherous eye on the young court dancer N ishat. In this
atmosphere Nadir Shah’s messages are ignored. His Ambassador
too is treated roughly. The King and the courtiers are drunk most
of the time. In an act of stupid recklessness Mohd. Shah tears
the letter of Nadir Shah and puts it in the cup of wine as a gesture
of utter contempt.
