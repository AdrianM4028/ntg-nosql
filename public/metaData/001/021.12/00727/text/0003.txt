Dada Damodar, Kanjoos and Post Ofﬁce—all achieved a remarkable degree of 5 good acting and
good production values.

In the ﬁeld of Opera. Delhi Art Theatre achieved outstanding successes. After Call of
the Valley and Rukhe Khet, new ground was broken by their production Heer Ranjha.

It

was

acclaimed as a landmark in this genre by the critics and public alike.
The opera Prirhviraj Chauhan by Sheila Bhatia has still to be produced.

Although a

number of times rehearsals were started, but for lack of an adequate cast they had to be discontinued. Fresh attempts are being made to stage it in the latter half of the year.

and stage workers should be established to create a live theatre.
