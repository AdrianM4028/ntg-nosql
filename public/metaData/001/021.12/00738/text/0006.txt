Y ASMIN

The theme of a woman’s fate has always interested me.
Lorca's Yerma with its earthiness, vitality, universal appeal and
poetic quality

fascinated me to render it into Punjabi.

It was a

challenge to render the delicate similies of Lorca into this language
which I feel has all the qualities of a powerful expression. How
the expression is used and how the vocal sounds are uttered make
or mar the basic qualities of a language.
I

have been faithful to the basic idea, situations, environments

of Yerma and similies used.
in

I have tried to render the whole play

blank verse and some portions in rhythmic verse.

For instance

the entire scene on the stream has been rendered into a long song
which is not there in the original script.
I have tried to capture the light and shade of life, the glow
and darkness in human heart and various hues of frustrations in

Yasmin, in the indigenous setting.
It is not important to particularize the locale where the action
takes place. Aspirations and mutilations of a human heart are
common to people everywhere.
