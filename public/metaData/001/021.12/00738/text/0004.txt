their first attempt in this genre. It was followed by Rukhe-Khet
which attained a larger measure of integration in its musical
form.

From these first steps emerged the Opera, Heer Ranjha, which
solidly laid the foundation of a modern and at the same time
indigenOus form of opera. It was acclaimed as a landmark in
theatre by the critics and the public alike.
The opera Prithviraj Chauhan followed. It captured the spirit
of 12th century India. It was hailed as a very bold experiment
which portrayed diverse moods and situations through haunting
melodies and thunderous choruses.
After this opera followed Chann Badlan Da which again was
acclaimed as a unique musical incorporating the best in folk music
with the best in stage craft.
Ghalib Kaun Hai broke new ground by presenting a musical
in Urdu. The combination of verse, prose, music and chorus lent
it colour and charm. It achieved universal acclaim and has solidly
laid the foundations of a new type of musical drama.
Next the group presented Jaan—e-Ghazal, again a musical in
Urdu. This musical depicts the evolution of Ghazal from Amir
Khusro to the present day. The idea that Ghazal cannot capture
serious thought is belied by this musical.

This was followed by Kissa YehAurat Ka—Hawwa—Se—Hippie
Tak.

The theme is Indian woman from ancient times to the
modern. It is not a panegyric to Indian women, but depicts the
stark reality behind the silken curtain.

In all these major productions training formed an integral part
for artists whether they

were

actors,

singers

or

technicians.

Many raw hands became proficient in their crafts through this
training. Some of them are big names in the cultural world.
