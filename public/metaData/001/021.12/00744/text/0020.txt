Pakistan International Airlines’
Karachi and Lahre. ३

it’s just like coming home:
there’s nothing better:
For home is where welcome is.

Home is a PIA ﬂight. Where
you slip into comfort, sit
back and savour the warmth
...
. .
of familiar hospitality.

It’s truly special—your
PIA ﬂight to Karachi and
Lahore. As you journey
to past times and places

no longer out of reach,
A ﬂight to old dreams
come true.
Or to 3"Y 0f50 d esh°nations in
40 countries. And all the while,
with Pakistan International
Airlines, you’ve never really
left home.
