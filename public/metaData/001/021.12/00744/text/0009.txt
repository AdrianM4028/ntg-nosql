brought together in marriage ; children are born ; boredom sets in. Poor things, they have
been deprived of real passionate feelings. And then there is the rigidity of rules of society !
If any one dare break the set norms the society burns with anger. It is with this basic idea
that Yeh Ishq Nahin Aasan (To love is not easy) has been created. It was not an easy
task to select ghazals from the works of poets past and present. Situations created in the
play were the deciding factor.

‘Yeh Ishq Nahin Aasan’ has been illustrated by only two past tragic affairs—Laila
Majnu and Heer Ranjha for dramatic effectiveness. It is the present day situation which
is to be emphasised and thus a modern episode of love between Shama and Mehboob has
been depicted.

The tragedy of the modern couple depicts the new forms of pressures and

taboos that the society has imposed, be it caste, class or dowry. The mothers and fathers
of all the three girls involved have been enacted by the same actors to show that the society
basically has not changed its attitudes. Social workers have been introduced to show their
hypocracy. When it touches them personally their zeal for reforms become a mere pretence.
Maikhana introduced in the item is not only a place where people get together to have a
drink but it is a world where all types of people meet, plan, boast and this world goes on
inspite of whatever happens outside.
The tender hearts may wither and die, the society is least concerned and that is the
way of the world.
Since the theme covers past and present romances, the play is episodic in nature. It
covers a vast range of emotions. There are quick changes in costumes and make up.

Many actors are doing more then one role.
and dance.

Ghazals are sung and illustrated with mime

These various situations pose many challenges for the production.
