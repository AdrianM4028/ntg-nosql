Mehboob’s friend Manik forcibly takes him to Maikhana where Saqi gets attracted
towards him. When Saqi wants to know whether Mehboob really loves her, he is shocked
at this query. “If society didn’t permit Shama to illumine my house you .... ..?”

Saqi is totally disillusioned and tells him never to come to the Maikhana and even if
he did she will never meet him.
Mehboob has lost Shama and Saqi both. Still when he meets Shama he tries to
explain to her that it was only circumstances which led to whatever had happened.
Shama’s hurt is too great. The world has humiliated her. She has lost the battle
of love. But she has her own dignity and strength of character and she refuses to make any
compromises despite the havoc it will cause her.
She exclaims : “At the time of burial friends came with a handful of earth

to pay back for life times’ friendship” and thus she puts an end to the chapter and departs.
Crestfallen Mehboob is enveloped in his own world of loneliness.

Who was she ?

My friends !

And from where ?

I feel some one is dead today.
