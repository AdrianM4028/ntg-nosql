SYNOPSIS

It was the siiteEnth day of the Mahabharata War.

The play opens

with the royal entrance (voddolaga) of Duryodhana, accompanied by
his lieutinents, Karna and Drona. They plan the remaining course
of action in the War. Sama Saptaka is ordered to kill Arjuna.
The demonic Sama Saptaka faces Arjuna in the battlefield
and is defeated.
Dharmaraya confers with his brothers on how to crush the Chakra
Vyuha laid by the enemy. Abhimanyu, the little hero, volunteers
to do the job even as the elders chide him for taking up this

dangerous step.
The play closes with the Chakra Vyuha War where Abhimanyu fights
valiantly and succeeds in breaking the treaxherous cordon of
Kaurava’s soldiers. But, in the process, Abhimanyu gets killed
in the battle.
The earliest manuscript of Abhimanyu Kalaga Yakshagana play
dates far back to 1695 A.D. Another manuscript of the same
play dates back to 1812 A.D.
— Dr. Shivaram Karanth,
Yakshagana Bayalata, 1957.
