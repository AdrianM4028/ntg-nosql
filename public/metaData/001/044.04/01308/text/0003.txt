५ _ THAMBALNU
( A Manipuri legend )

' YAIRIPOK—

in the land of the Meiteis, who are the

1nhab1ta11tsofMa111pur Valley, wth its

surrounding hills

of KAINA and KWAROK, the POIROU LAKE and
LEISANGKHONG DAM etc. is the milieu of this story.
This tragic play is based on a legend 0f the Meitei people,

५ believed to have taken place during the reign of Maharaja
‘Gambhir Singh
'Ihambalnu, the beautiful damsel of Yairipok, had nobody
in this world except her widowed mother and a young
. brother. She was inlove with Mohon .Singh, a poor but
upright youngman of the locality. But Selungba Pranam
Singh, the local administrator and advisor of the king, too

had an eye on Thambalnu and longed to be united with
‘

her in marriage.
५ On account of heavy rains, ' the inhabitants of the Village
suffered from ﬂoods. The dam at Leisangkhong Thingel was

' damaged and requires immediate repair to halt the ﬂood
' ३ रंदेमुंदृद्रहुँ Mohon Singh mobilised the youth of the village and
३ persuaded them to repair the dam by voluntary labour which
was objected by Sel‘ungba Pranam Singh as unnecessary

and uncalled for interference in his duty as Administrator of
the village.

This, and the knowledge that 'I'hambalnu was in love with
पृ him, 'led to a clash between Mohon Singh and Pranam
Singh. It was insult added ३ to injury when Thambalnu

spurned the love of Selungba Pranam Singh. He, an evil
genius, conspired against her life and poor Thambalnu, was
cornered to be sacriﬁced because of her name ending ‘NU’.

It was too late when Mohon Singh arrived to save Thambalnu
but not so, to take revenge on W1cked Selungba Pranam
में Singh He then threw himself. into the whirlpool till he was
. sucked into the bosom of the river to be united with his

५ beloved Thambalnu forever.
