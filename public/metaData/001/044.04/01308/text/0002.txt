Besides the Performances, there were regular lecture sessions
on the history and culture of Maiipur by eminent Scholars
and Experts which have greatly helped us in understanding

the different forms. Field-visits and on-the—spot studies to
important historiCal sites and monuments has further helped
दृ us

in absorbing and assimilating the ethos Of Manipuri

culture and traditions.

1n the early morning there were daily warming up sessions for
all and exercises in Martial Arts movements.

In the evenings, practical classes on basic dance movements
and music- are being conducted regularly.
Throughout one week, we prepared ourselves emotionally to
enter into the world of an alien and distinctive traditional

performance and it was only made possible because of the
excellent and well-planned nature of the training.
