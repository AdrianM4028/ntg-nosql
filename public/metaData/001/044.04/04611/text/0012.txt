Three gods are expected on earth in search of a good person. In Pokhram, Jagdeesh, a water seller, is
waiting for them. On their arrival he treats them with his water and with great difﬁculty makes arrangements
for their lodging with Shanti Bai, a prostitute. He thinks he has failed in making any proper arrangement for
their stay therefore he runs away.
The gods on leaving reward Shanti Bai with some money.
Scene 1
Shanti Bai buys a Bidi shop with that money. She is very enthusiastic about helping the poor. One by
one other parasites block into her shop. Mrs. Karori Mal, the owner of the shop demands for advance of
One Thousand Rupees.
Jagdish dreams of the Gods, and gives them excuses for not being able to ﬁnd any accommodation for
them but they tell him about Shanti Bai’s hospitality. He feels sorry for running away. The gods ask Jagdish
to search for Shanti Bai and to inform them about her for they think that no one can remain good for a long

time. They move on to search for more good people.
Scene 2

Sheetla Prasad cousin of Shanti Bai comes and somehow or the other manages to throwout everyone
from the shop. According to him they were taking advantage of Shanti Bai’s innocence. A kind-hearted
policeman helps Sheetla Prasad by suggesting that he should marry off Shanti with a good man.
Scene 3

Ram Singh a pilot who is a failure in- his job comes to the park to commit suicide. Shanti Bai on- seeing
the rope does guess his intention and tells him to avoid it. He tells her of his unfulﬁlled dreams. They fall
in love. Jagdeesh meets Shanti.
Jagdeesh talks to gods in his dreams. He informs them of her goodness to the needy but also that the
carpenter Khati's money has not been returned and that she has had to take help of her brother Sheetla
Prasad, a bussiness man to take care of the shop.
Scene 4
Hazarimal beats Jagdeesh and breaks his arm. Though Shanti B ai helps all needy, still they speak ill of her.
