Hither you have come to appear on the stage, but Ô¨Årst
You must tell us : what is the point?
You have come to show yourselves before the public
And what you can do, in short to be put on view
As something worth seeing...
And the public, you hope
Will give you applause as you sweep them away
From their narrow world into your broad one, allowing them
to enjoy
Vertigo on the summit ridge, the passions at their '
Fullest strength. And now you are asked: what is the point?

For down here, on the ' lower benches

Your spectators have started disputing: obstinately
Some of them insist you should
On no account show yourselves only but
The world. What's the good, they say
Of our once again being enabled to see how this man
Can be sad, or this woman heartless, or what sort of

Wicked monarch that man at the back can portray? What is
the point
Of this continual presentation of the postures and grirnaces
Of a handful of people relentlessly gripped by Fate?

You, actor
Must master the art of observation

Before all other arts.
