social position and their analysis have been playing
a major role in our socio-political life for the last
20 years. Naturally, this environment has greatly influenced the art forms of today, especially theatre.
The EXPRESSION Theatre Festival will present
plays from all over the country relfecting these concerns.
Most of these plays challenge pre-conceived definitions
of the representation of women in contemporary theatre.
At the same time, by deriving significant forms from
tradition and improvising on the established structures,
these plays widen women's experiential horizons.
