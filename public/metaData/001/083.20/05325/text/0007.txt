who

enters his life to take him on a journey, wholly different.
But the intensity of her silent fantasy is too much
for him. Unable to bear it, he destroys her.
He attempts to return to a 'normal' life. When

he attends Church, he is forced °to confront the fundamental conflict between his religious training and the
world of nature.

it explores the man-woman relationship, which” can
never be fully realised because it is so grossly distorted
by religion and society.
