JAGINE JAU
TO (Waking Up in English translation),
a one—woman play, can be called one day in the life
of any working woman. On the one hand, it humourously
portrays the double burden of a working woman franti~
cally trying to strike a balance between her roles
as a worker in the factory and as a mother-cum—wifecum-maid in the family. On the other hand, it shows
the destructive effect of the ,intrusion of inanimate
gadgets. Instead of facilitating her daily life, these
commodities invade her intimate space and stifle. her.
