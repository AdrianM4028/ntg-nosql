The Seminar
The

seminar

will

provide

a

platform

to

open

a dialogue between artists and scholars involved with
the women's question and activists engaged in raising
women's consciousness at the social and political level.
This dialogue,
hopefully, will evolve
an ideological
understanding of the issues involved and its projection
in the work of individual artists and organisations involved
in the women's movement. The seminar also hopes
to create an environment for interaction bewteen artists
of different disciplines which might lead to more complex
forms of expression closer
to women’s experiences
and desires.
