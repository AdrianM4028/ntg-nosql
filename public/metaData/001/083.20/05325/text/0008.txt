LLAVATI by Cultural Centre, Madras.
Conceived and choreographed by Chandralekha.
LILAVATI, a dance-drama inspired by the celebrated
text on Indian mathematics by Bhaskaracharya, is a
visualization of certain numerical questions, posed in the
poetic shlokas of Bhaskara. The text is addressed
highly
to Bhaskara's daughter Lilavati and is a classic attempt
at transforming learning into a joyous, creative activity.
LlLAVATl
traces the link between natya, kavya and
ganita and gives numbers

an

imaginative, sensual form.
