NAGAMANDALA is based on two folk tales
on Kamataka which are woven together to emerge
1.5 a :lay within a play. It comments on the
paradoxical nature of oral tales - how they have an
exisrence of their own, independent of the narrator,
yet how they survive only when passed on by one
story-teller to another.
