and CANDIDE, leave the security of their books to
become Rock stars in the modern day world. Our
characters meet in “Literary limbo”, where they are
Forced to relive their mundane existence for inﬁnity.
३ ठेच्चाश्चाशाइ to shake this fate Lady Macbeth decides to
‘jump the life to come”, and go where Candide will
“ﬁnd the best of all possible worlds” and Hamlet will
be free of all his many problems, and Lady Macbeth
will “rule as the Queen of Fame”. Transported to
modern day New York they embark on a journey
that takes them round the world of pop culture, yet
their dear dreams of success constantly elude them.
They part ways only to reunite. And in a series of
twists their fates catch up with them, trapping them
back into literature.
