death. Nana concludes he is one of those who came to carry Bhau to the

cremation-ground.
He discusses with Bhau the possibility that Rama and
the man conspired to murder Bhau. He plans 3 big feast on the thirteenth
day to which he will invite all those present on the day Bhau died, so he
can find the man.

The guests gather for the feast.

Nana, whose only clue is that the man

was the third from the left of those who carried Bhau's body, tries to find

out from them the identity of his mother's new lover, without revealing
why he wants to know. He doesn't manage to find out. Then he suggests
to Bhau that Bhau should put on a suit and dark glasses and imitate the
new lover, in order to find out from his wife who the man is and how Bhau

met his death.
