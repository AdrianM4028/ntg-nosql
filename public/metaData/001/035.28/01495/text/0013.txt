I have been able to form a team ofdancers in my company "BHOOMIKA"
who have been trained to use their bodies as a means of experession. The

use of muscles. stretches, contractions. leaps. formations, designs with
props designs in space.

It is an exciting, energetic and very creative

process. Another signiﬁcant factor is the use of the whole group as an
"ensemble". a composite means of expression.

The modern choreography has to have a rightful place in the whole
Indian dance scene. I have a faith that Indian Contemporary Dance could
be one day'as rich and varied as our traditions. There are quite a few talents
around. They need platform, recognition and projection. In its absence our
dance shall remain stagnated in the past glory. The Indian dance has

passed the stage of revivalism and looks forward for fresh explorations.
