FROM HIS GROUP
Rajan did the sound for the ﬁrst production of OCBS. He has been working on
plays for a few years now and I beleive this is his ﬁrst directorial venture. OCBS
was my ﬁrst play and one that I never wanted to hury. But plays need vehicles and
OCB S couldn't ﬁnd one after the ﬁrst run. So when Rajan said that he wanted to
direct it. I ran back to the script, reworked some scenes for him and gave him

permission. I thank Rajan for rescusing the play from an imminent burial.

OCBS has ceased to be a play about AIDS and HIV. It became my ﬁrst and perhaps
last attempt at tackling what we call middle class virtues. Now, there is little more I
can say without rehashing the same. Also, that anger, which really gave birth to the
play. I cannot communicate so directly. For me OCB S works only because of these
two reasons. It questions the deﬁnition the deﬁnition of the "good" that we have set
out to deﬁne for ourselves, through each member of the Bahl family. And it asks

these questions quite directly. No exposition here for the connoisscur. Rajan
understands that and is best placed, along with his friends to translate that into a

meaningful production.
