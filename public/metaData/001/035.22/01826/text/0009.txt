Lion, he asked me to inform you of his challenge that whoever is powerful and shall

kill the other shall be the king ‘ and shall eat me.” Hearing this the Lion was furious
and asked the Rabbit‘tb‘ShOw‘the Way to his enemy. The Rabbit took him to a well,
pointing to the place where his enemy lived. The Lion peeped into the well and
seeing his own reflection in the water, he jumped into it thinking it to be his enemy
and was drowned. There was rejoicing among the animals and they all lived
peacefully and happily thereafter.
