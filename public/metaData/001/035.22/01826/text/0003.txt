What They Say

Mark Twain once wrote, “It is my conviction that the children’s
theatre is one of the very, very great inventions of the twentieth
century, and that its vast educational value now dim/y perceived and
vaguely understood—willpresent/y come to be recognized.......' ..”

Picasso summed up his evolution—"At 12, I could draw like
Rapheal.

It took me the whole of life to learn how to paint like 2!

ch ild. ’ ’

“Aesthetic education,” says Sergei Obraztsov, ”begins in. all
places where a child is surrounded by beauty.

And we should like

children who come to the theatre immediately to see ﬁsh and birds
and ﬂowers, and beauty and perfection in everything.”

Walter Sore/l in his book THE DANCER’S IMAGE said “I do
not think we have outgrown the child—in-man stage because we have
reached moon.

Because we have reached moon, we will need fairy

tales more than ever.

Only our mind which knows so much more

only have to adjust to the story or the story to our more sophisticated ३
mind ”
