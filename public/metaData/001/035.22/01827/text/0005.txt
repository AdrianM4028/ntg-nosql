THEATRE F O R CHILDREN

Children’s Theatre is the basic theatre. Unless we develop such a theatre, there
cannot be a worthwhile adult theatre in the country. Only such a theatre can produce our
future audience and artistS.

It is time that education and entertainment, school and theatre

come closer.

Theatre for children by professional artist is a new concept. Started after the
Revolution about 1918 the U.S.S.R. has to-day about 150 professional drama, opera,
musical and puppet theatres putting up 90,000 performances for 32 million children and youth
annually.
The national policy for education and culture in India has not been able to grasp
the immense potentials of a meaningful theatre entertainment in building up the child’s
personality. Hence the theatre for children has not got at present its rightful in our
country.
It is time that the theatre for children should become a national movement with

each State Capital having such a. theatre to begin with.

Delhi, the Capital can give the lead.

Despite all the rich heritage in art and culture, we in India do not possess any living
tradition of a theatre for children. We have to begin from the beginning. " It is a challenge
’
‘
that we have to accept.

BHOOMIKA has taken upon itself the responsibility to establish a regular Dance
Theatre for Children in Delhi presenting a performance every Sunday morning. During
the last four years it has produced 10 short and major ballets including TICK-TICK and
PANCHTANTRA KA SHER and given several performances at Sapru House sponsored by
Children’s Film Society and at other leading theatres. To continue this important work and
expand it, we need funds and need them badly.

Delhi has a child population of 15 lakhs, and we spend Rs. 33/- crores on education.
The Capital and its Administration can give a lead by promoting the ﬁrst professional

Theatre f -r Children and co-ordinating it with education.
