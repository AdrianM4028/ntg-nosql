Director’s Note
Bhoomika's activity has been directed towards

the search for a new spirit in Indian dance.
Bhoomika has been exploring a new vocabulary,
and experimenting with different themes. The

search is to develop new forms in dance and
discover ones own self in the process.
This evening, in our performance, we present
four items :
Aalingan, is choreographed as a pure dance
item. It is an embrace of man and woman in
ecstasy of love and belonging. The dance
movements are in slow rythm,
Shikari is a dance in Chhau Style from Orissa.
It projects the robust character of the dance
style. The dance has been adopted in a group
form by Guru Krishan Chandra Naik. Shikari is
traditionally a solo dance but Bhoomika has
adapted it in a group.
Wolf— Boy discovers the identity of a thrown
out character, a reject of human society, It
depicts the inhumanity of man and humanity of
animals.
Conference-79 is a statement in satire, on the

way we adults neglect, our children not giving
them their due. We always discuss about them
but do nothing, The occasion of the ballet is the
International Year of the child-1979.
