1. WOLF — BOY
Constrained by the norms of society, an unwed
mother leaves her new-born son in the wilds, to
perish. A pack of wolves chances to find the
boy and whisks him away to be brought up as
one of them, When the boy is grown up, a
fortuitous event exposes him to the villagers
nearby. A creature that is neither fully human
nor fully animal vastly intrigues them. Word
about the find travels fast, and soon a team of

rnedicos, sociologists and others of their like,
descends on the scene to conduct various
investigations on the boy, all of which only
leaves them more puzzled. Presently, the village
is in the grip of a severe famine. The local
sooth sayer ascribes this to the evil influence of
the boy and advices that he be sacrificed. This is
done, and there is only one to shed tears-—the
boy's wolf-mother.
