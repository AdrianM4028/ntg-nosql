THE PLAY

In the cauldron of contradictory emotions that
constitutes the woman’s world —- in a life of
hardship and oppression where discrimination and
inequality are so intricately interwoven into the
daily fabric of our lives —— the ability to sift black
from the white from among the shades of grey is
A what makes the beginning of a change. To know,

understand and therefore to fight.

‘PANKH HOTE TO UD JAA'I‘I’ chronicles
the constant uphill struggle of a Himachali woman.
There is no romance here, though it attests a love
deeply rooted in the usurped land. No academic
Optimism where illusory easy victories are spun
out of pseudo-philosophical theories. No unwar३ ranted pessimism. Only pounding reality, now
unpalatable —— now lifting, but always moving
towards the known to-be-known struggle to

discover the truth.

The play is based on Tennessee Williams’ ‘The

Glass Menagariezw-
