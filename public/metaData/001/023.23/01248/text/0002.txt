THE GROUP ‘

Act-One, which came into existence in 1988,
is a collage of theatre activists. Pe0ple from various
professional backgrounds — painters, musicians,
actors, ﬁlm-makers, writers, etc., who believe in
theatre as a movement, a process, an experiment,
came under one umbrella to pursue theatre. ActOne ﬁrmly believes that humility and sincerity
coupled with a high sense of professional responsibility and dedication makes theatre vital and start—
lingly original. We do not believe in merely
attempting to dazzle our audience with gimmicks,
paradoxes and clever stylisation. We prefer to rely
upon hard work in producing play. In getting the
best from the actors, in achieving a high level of
dramatic performance.
Act-One has tried different themes, genres and
styles. Yet all the productions have one thing in
common - they all deal with real situations and
view man as an integral part of a society. All our
productions, ultimately repose faith in humanity,
faith in the ability of the people to create and not
destroy, faith in mankind to surpass barriers which
dividc .
For us theatre is a continuous process an
unending movement. We believe that stagnation
puts an end to creativity.
