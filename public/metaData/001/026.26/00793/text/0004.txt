SE1 BRIDDHA—Anlmm रे---------------------,
Adaptation by Shri Bhola Dutta

MURDER WILL OUT.

Not merely the obvious fact of a murder having

taking place but things that happen to the murderer or murderers. For everyone has to pay for a crime committed, whether immediately or in diﬁerred payment. One may escape the hangman but not himself, for his conscience will
never let him alone. Retribution is like a poison that works quickly or slowly

but never fails.

This is the central theme of the play being presented this evening, Sei
Briddha, an adaptation of Maxim Gorky’s play The Old Man. Two young men,
Gurupada and Ananta, murder a man. Ananta is caught-and sentenced to life
imprisonment. Gurupada assumes a new identity and, under the name of

Mahadeb, prospers exceedingly in business, acquires new friends and happens
to win the love of a woman—without anyone knowing his , true identity. To
eXpiate his crime he launches into a career'of charity (and public service and
is esteemed as a model of benevolence. ' But no good thing he does can st0p
the gnawing of the canker in his heart and, as the play opens, he hourly
expects a ﬁnal crash.

Ananta, released from prison after serving his full term. finds out
Mahadeb’s habitat and goes there with intent to'make his old accomplice
to
suffer as he had undergone during his long term in prison. Things begin
the
move quickly and complications arise. Finally, Gurupada-Mahadeb takes
tor—he
easy way out—a way neither anticipated nor desired by his persecu
of the Immortals
shoots himself out of all trouble. Thus did the President
get out of the invisible
end his sport with the man who had tried his best to
web 0f justice.
