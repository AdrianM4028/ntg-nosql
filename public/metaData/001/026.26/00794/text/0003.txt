ME S SAGE
Hearty greetings to Juba Sampradaya on its
3-4th Anniversary.

For theatre-lovers in the capital,

and particularly for admirers of Bengali drama,

gplays organised by the Sampradaya are generally
a treat. I hope that this year’s performance also

*will regale the Viewers.

Please accept my best

wishes for the function.
