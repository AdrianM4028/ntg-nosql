The King is now greatly perturbed. full of fear for his
own fate and in deep anguish for the cruel way he had destroyed the entire herd of deer. A sadhu happens to pass by and
the King seeks his help for a way out of his misery.
The sadhu is unable to bring the dead back to life but
summons his Guru who is no other than Guru Gorakhnath.

The Guru gives life to the herd of deer who scarnper away
into the forest.

As for the curse of the does,

he says. the

word of a sati can never be false and he should be prepared
for his fate.
No sooner are the words spoken than the minister brings
news of how the Kingâ€™s little joke has cost him the life of his

dear queen. The King. plunged in grief, falls at the feet of
Guru Gorakhnath. The Guru with his miraculous powers
creates a number of Pingalas and then makes them disappear.
He tells the King to go back home where his queen is waiting

for him.
The King is. however, so deeply affected by what he had
seen that instead of returning to the life of the palace he
decides to

renounce the world and become a

disciple of

Guru Gorakhnath.
Before he can be accepted, however, he must pass a test.
The test is that he should go to the palace in his new garb of

a sadhu and beg alms from Pingala addressing and regarding
her as mother.

The King comes triumphant out of the trial. is welcomed
by the Guru in his fold and admitted to eternal life.
