VI R TEJAJI

Tejaji, son of the village chief, arrives on the

river

bank with his friends to take a bath and offer his morning
prayers.

They have occupied the entire ghat and the village

women are unable to fill their pitchers. Tejaji’s bhabi
(elder brother's wife) asks him to hurry but he refuses to
leave before he has ﬁnished his prayers. His Bhabi
tells him tauntingly that while he is devoting himself so
seriously to the service of religion his wife is pining
in separation in her mother’s house.
