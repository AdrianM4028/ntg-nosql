jAT RA
T‘atra orjatra (literally, j0urney) owes its name and origin
to the practice of taking out images of deities in procession

to the accompaniment of dance and song. These religious
processions or ‘yatras’, when organized in the conﬁnes of the
temple compound or the courtyards of rich people, took on
the form of mass worship by singing and dancing devotees
with the image resting on a pedestal.

In course of time the

jatra developed into a kind of open air religious play with the
song and music as its most important element. The plays,
of course, were unwritten because the‘actors’ knew their

devotional songs anyhow and the little dialogue required to
link the episodes was devised on the spot.

Mahaprabhu with his disciples holding jatra performances of
Brajaleela and Rukmz'niharan on the basis of written scripts. But
the freedom of the actors to extemporize was never really
curtailed and has persisted as a convention up to the present
time. Some distinctly theatrical conventions were also
developed in course of time. One of these was the use of joor/zi.
a band of singers which sang in chorus to emphasize particular

points in the story or the play. A character called vivek
(conscience) was introduced and became a unique feature of
thejatra play. He moves in and out of the scenes, unrestricted
by time and space, and makes his pronouncements on the evil
and the good without fear or favour.

Jatra along with its kindred forms—Kavi, Tarja, Malsi,
