the better-off classes and made theatre-going fashionable in
Calcutta. It had a profound influence on the drama of Bengal
including thejatra play. In the course of time the form l05t
many of its special features.

'

But so deeply entrenched is the tradition in the life of
Bengal that neither the urban stage nor the cinema has been
able to put jatra parties out of business. It continues to be
a virile art form and attracts people by the thousand drawing
its appeal both from its dramatic power and religious fervour.

In the current festival twojatra plays are being presented
by the Naba Ranian Opera of Calcutta.
The story of this troupe goes back to the ﬁrst years of
this century when Raja Kamala Ranjan Chakraborty of
Hetarnpur, in the district of Beerbhoom, organised a party
ofyatra players called “Ranjan Opera”. The purpose was to
hold jatra plays during festive days such as Durga Puja, Kali

puja, Rathayatra, Dole-Yatra (Holi festival) and also during
marriage ceremonies in the family. As was customary grants
of paddy ﬁelds or tanks were given to the artists who were

also farmers and workers in other rural occupations.
Kumar Biswa Ranjan

Chakraborty,

son of the Raja,

decided to take the troupe beyond the confines of his estate.
He recruited a number of professional players and brought
his troupe to Calcutta setting up his headquarters at a place

at Chitpur Road (which area is even today the jatra locality
of Calcutta).
ln I940, however, Kumar Biswa Ranjan left his group
which was taken over by Sri jibon Krishna Das who has since
been running the group under the name Naba Ranjan Opera.
