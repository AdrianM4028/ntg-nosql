produced on Tamasha. V. Shantaram’s Amar Bhoopali, Jaya Malhar,
Mi 'I‘ulas Tuzya Angani, Sangatye Aika, were the more popular ones
among them. Recently even Hindi ﬁlms have borrowed 'I‘amasha
tunes and music.
Tamasha has also made a contribution to the theatre during the past
seventy years. Plays have been written on the life of Tamasha masters
Honaji Bala and Patthe Bapurao. Tamasha tunes have been used in
several plays. Recently Vijay Tendulkar has written a play, Sari Ga Sari,
using Tamasha technique.
At present Tamasha is not only being improved and reﬁned,but
also widening its horizons. Modern themes are being handled by it.
Vasant Bapat, Vasant Sabnis, Annabhau Sathe, Amarshekh, Vijay Tendulkar, Shaheer Sable, P. L. Deshpande, G. D. Madgulkar and other poets

and producers are making it a digniﬁed art.
Yet 'I‘amasha suffers from two chronic diseases—poverty and lack
of organisation among the players.
Tamasha has a bright future. New avenues are opening up before
it. But in its present condition it lacks the strength, though it has the
will, to go ahead.
