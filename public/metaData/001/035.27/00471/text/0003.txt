interesting forms and artistic representations which together constitute
this popular f'olk theatre of Maharashtra. As a result, we chose three
different groups of renowned artistes of Maharashtra to present the programme in a three-day festival of Tamasha. Each" day is devoted to a
special aspect of this art form. We commence the festival giving glimpses
of the folk arts of Maharashtra which form the background of Tamasha,
to be followed by Sangit Bari, the musical representation spiced with
humorous dialogue, and conclude with dholki plzad and Vag, the dramatic
form of Tamasha enlivened with song, speech and dances.
The project has been undertaken by the Bharatiya Natya Sangh and
has been aided by the Sangeet Natak Akademi.
I take this opportunity to thank Dr. Suresh Awasthi, who, after initiating the project, entrusted it to me to continue it.
I gratefully acknowledge, on behalf of Bharatiya Natya Sangh, the
invaluable guidance and assistance given to me, in conducting the survey

of Tamasha, by Shri B. K. Kelkar, Chief Information Ofﬁcer, and Shri
Raja Ram Humane, Chief Cultural Ofﬁcer, Government of Maharashtra,
Bombay; Shri Ganga Ram Patil and Shri Bala Saheb Gore of the Marathi
Tamasha Parishad, Poona; Shri V. L. lnamdar and a

host of

‘Tamasgirs’ of Maharashtra and leading institutions.
