K aala Mainda Bhes is the story of a small village
in the Cholistan desert. The villagers are being

exploited by a small time Peer and his chelas who

have control of the only source of water in the
village - the well.
This play is about the hopes and aspirations of the
village characters - there is Allah Wassaiah, the
local Mashki or water-carrier, who wants to break

free of the Peers' clutches in order to earn his living.
Then there is Piran Ditta, a poor farmer, who has

been digging a well in his barren land for years in

the hope of finding water one day. There are also
Sundari and Sohni, the two wives of Allah

Wassaiah who are blamed for being barren. In
fact, the recurrent images of barrenness and

fertility, are the theme of the play. Water becomes

the dominant metaphor which is iuxtaposed
against the aridity of a wasteland.

The production, an experiment in the folk theatre
tradition, is resplendent with the colourful
costumes, vibrant music and dance of the desert.

The play has been written by Shahid Nadeem and

directed by Madeeha Gauhar.
