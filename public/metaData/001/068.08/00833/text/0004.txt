TA 8I II३ R DES I I
( Kingdom ( )f ( faults)
'I‘asher Desh was written by

Rabindranath Tagore in 1938 and dedicated to the ﬁrebrand young revolutionary, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. The
story of the young prince who revolutionizes the land of cards is an entertaining
parable ofthe youth power to bring change;
it is also a satire on the norms of the
hierarchical caste society.
The inhabitants of the land ofcards

are so stultiﬁed by rules and regulations
that they have lost all semblance of humanity. Laughter is forbidden to them;
every step and every action is monitored;
normal human contact is unheard of. Into
this strange world comes the restless
prince accompanied by his friend.

Part One: The prince has broken
free of the shackles of palace life and set
out on a sea voyage. He is shipwrecked on
the land of card, and amazed at the sight
of the people there who tell him that they
were born out of the yawn of the Creator.
"We were born from the Creator's sneeze ' '
answer the young men. A long argument
ensues and the prince is interrogated by
the king. He appeals to the women of the
court, asking them to let the warmth of
love enter their passive statue-like selves.

The queen of cards is moved by his
words. When the generals try to exile the
prince, she protests. The court womenjoin

her in the ﬁrst show ofrebellion. The king
dismisses the court in alarm.
Part Two: A new breeze wafts
through the land of cards. The women
have started to sing and gossip; the queen
sheds her cards costume and dances a
dance of freedom; and the Jack of Dia-

monds falls in love with the Queen of
Hearts. Even the King's two generals ask:
”Why does everything seem meaning1ess‘?’ '

Part Three: The king realizes that
everything has changed. His queen and

the subjects try to convince him that they
have found the right way, but he is adamant. The queen exclaims, "Victory to the
human will", and all the subjects join her.
Suddenly the king ﬁnds himselfall alone.
A moment later he too joins the ﬁnal
celebration: "Break all the dams. Let the
ﬂood of life inundate all."
