FOOD CORPORATION OF INDIA
Freedom brought us great joys, but also great

burdens. Amongst them... the responsibility of feeding
a nation of millions. The task was enormous. It was
time for an agriculture and food-management
revolution. To help provide food security for the nation.
And to help fight a new freedom struggle. Freedom
from hunger.

Government of India’s crusade begins at the grass

roots, with the nation‘s farmers. Though the price
assurance system and an apparatus like the Food
Corporation of India to mop up the surplus, it
encourages the farmers to grow more foodgrains.

Procuring foodgrains is only one aspect of
Government’s policy. It is FCl’s mission to translate

the Government avowed policy of making food grains
available at a fair price to all, and even in the remote

and inaccessible areas at a still reduced price. This is
a mammoth task involving the transport of foodgrains
across the length and breadth of the country.

Indian farmers ushered in the Green Revolution, FCl
contributed in nurturing and sustaining it. And together
they sowed the seed for self sufficiency in Foodgrains.
A dramatic feat which has been applauded the world
over
