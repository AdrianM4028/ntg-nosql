EK LAPATA SAINIK KI MA
The Mother of the Missing Soldier

A Mother is but a mother, regardless of her
country. And when her son goes missing, her
agony is sharpened into a searing wail. All the
more so, when the son is missing in war.
This innovative dramatic presentation is the cry

of two mothers plagued by infinite questions
about war. Questions of the mothers standing
on either side of the border. Questions eternal,

still unanswered since the times of Mahabharata.
Questions are

innumerable. To

seek their

answers, the two mothers of the missing soldiers
have thrown a challenge. The role of the two
mothers is being enacted by one actress, who
has established her exclusive identity in India.
