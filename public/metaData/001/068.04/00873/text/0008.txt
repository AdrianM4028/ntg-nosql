and Manoj Mitra’s Chakbhanga Mad/m in 1972. His Theatre
Workshop productions included plays by Brecht, Tagore, Utpal

based on a folk ballad. He has directed several productions
for other groups, including Rangakarmee, Nandipat and the

Paschim Banga Natya Akademi. As an actor, he has appeared
in most of the plays he has directed, and also in a version

of Brecht’s Galileo (in which Sombhu Mitra played the lead)

Mrinal Sen’s Parashuram. In his long spell as a producer with
Doordarshan Calcutta, he produced several significant
interviews, features and telelilms. He was awarded the Sangeet
