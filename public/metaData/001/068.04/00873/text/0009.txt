as part of the real. On yet another level,Jochhanakumari creates
the ambience of an essentially folk fantasy; the drama growing
out of the persistent conflicts and resolutions played and
worked out between nature, primeval humanity and folk ritual
on one side and the economic, social and religious positions
as they change ‘and evolve with the changes that affect rural
Bengal. Jochhanakumari has assumed a distinctive character
of its own through the collaboration of poet-playwright Mohit
Chattopadhyay, lyricist—composer Dinendra Chaudhury, and
poet—novelist Sunil Gangopadhyay. It was a challenge to me,
to capture its distinctiveness in theatric terms. I love taking
on challenges, with total disregard for economic considerations
or prospects Once again for me it was a folk play in terms
of its language and music, and its people, and it had to be
presented in terms of modern theatric practice. This time I
was not handling any fairy tale. My theme was a slice of reality
with all its ﬁre and gore. The departure in theme naturally
demanded a different productional style. And my audiences
know how I hate to repeat myself.’

Cast

Set in a border town between the two Banglas, it centres
on a woman, who is initially part of the local lore, a shadowy
creature, till she is identiﬁed as one who is both Hindu and

Muslim,

violated

and

yet

hypersensitive,

loved

and

suspected. Even as she becomes more and more real, and ﬁnds
one who loves her, tragedy strikes; and she is shot down on

the border itself.
