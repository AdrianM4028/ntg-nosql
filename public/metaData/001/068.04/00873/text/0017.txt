The Seminar
The Seminar on Bengali Theatre in the Indian Context- should
be an occasion for theatre workers in Calcutta—the veteran
actor-director Kumar Roy, SNA awardee and as part of
Bohurupee, with an uninterrupted career of more than
forty-ﬁve years, and an academic in his own right, Ashok
Mukhopadhyay, a younger actor-director, academic and
playwright, and Usha Ganguly, who has made a major
breakthrough in Hindi theatre in Calcutta, and given the Hindi
theatre in Calcutta a commitment, a popularity and national
circulation that has been unprecedented~—and theatre viewers
in Delhi, like Dr. G. P. Deshpande, playwright, social scientist
and scholar, Sisirkumar Das, playwright and scholar, and
Rajinder Nath, director, to exchange notes, and may be even

come to a consensus on what Bengali theatre can offer to.
the palimpsest of Indian theatre in the near future; and at
the same time offer viewers in Delhi insights and entry points
into Bengali theatre and the traditions that it has internalized
and developed and enriched. Bengali theatre, like any Indian
theatre in any of the Indian languages, needs to be viewed
in its, own cultural context as well asin terms of its interactions
with and relevance for the Indian theatre experience as a whole.
That will be the point of reference for the Seminar.
