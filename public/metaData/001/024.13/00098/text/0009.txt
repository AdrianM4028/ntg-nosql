THE RAMAYANA—
A LINGUISTIC STUDY
BY

DR. SATYA VRAT
Reader in Sanskrit, Delhi University

The Ramayana is always a fascinating study. This Aa’i Kavya corning from the pen of one of India’s greatest poets has exercised a
very powerful inﬂuence on the life and thought of millions of people
of India over the ages. A voluminous work like the Ramayana can
certainly be expected to be a good repertory of all kinds of information, historical, social, religious and cultural. So can it be a good
index of the language as it obtained in contemporary society.

The present study is the ﬁrst attempt of its kind analysing and critically evaluating the language of the Ramayana in all its varied
aspects and, therefore, fulﬁls a long-felt desideratum. The twentyfour thousand verses of this great epic of India have been given here
the most searching treatment and fresh ground broken in more ways
than one. The study of the Ramayana synonyms, phonetic tendencies, onornatopoeia, prepositional verbs, usage and un-Paninian

forms, to mention only a few of the many topics dealt with exhaustively here, is bound to interest students of Sanskrit language in
general and Linguistics in particular. The treatment of the subject
is scientiﬁc throughout.

The work is well-documented.
