The tragedy opens amid thunder and lightning. The three witches,
unseen but audible, agree to meet Macbeth at the close of the battle which is
now raging.
Tidings of the battle are brought to Duncan, King of Scotland. He learns
that his cousin Macbeth, thane of Glamis, has killed the rebel Macdonwald,

and in a second conﬂict has defeated Macdonwald’s Norwegian allies and the
traitorous thane of Cawdor. Duncan decides to confer Cawdor’s title on the
victorious Macbeth, and sends Ross to convey the honour.
The witches greet Macbeth by three titles—thane of Olamis, thane of

Make up

The other General, Banquo, receives the pro-

mise that, though no king himself, he shall be the father of kings. Ross then
arrives, and salutes Macbeth as ‘thane of Cawdor”. This sudden fulﬁlment of

one prOphecy turns Macbeth’s mind forcibly on the promise of kingship.
The aged King meets his cousin and captain with a heart full of gratitude.
He makes Malcolm, his elder son, Prince of Cumberland and declares his

intention of following Macbeth to Inverness as his guest.
Lady Macbeth reads the witches’ prophecy in a letter despatched by
Macbeth. She knows his ambition, and she knows his scruples. She steels
herself for the elTort and on Macbeth’s entrance assures him of her support in
the ‘great business’ now impending.

Following on the heels of Macbeth, Duncan and Banquo enter the castle
at Inverness and are graciously welcomed by their hostess.

A banquet is in progress on the same night.

Macbeth slips away from

his guests and sees with fearful clearness the horror of his projected crime. He

resolves to ‘proceed no further. But, Lady Macbeth, with a supreme effort of
_ persuasion, brings him back to his ﬁrst intention. She determines to drug the
King’s grooms, smear their faces with blood and so cast on them the suspicion
of murder.
