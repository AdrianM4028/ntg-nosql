JV'ovember, 23, 1.964.

I am glad to know that “Anamika” is holding in December a Festival of Hindi
Theatre at Calcutta.
Theatre in India has a rich heritage and should aim at providing healthy entertainment to the people and emphasising the cultural and emotional unity of the
country. I hope the Festival and the various seminars proposed to be held
would help correct appraisal of the problems of Indian Theatre and enlighten people
about the important role theatre has to play in the cultural life of the community.
I wish the Festival all success.

I take this opportunity to send ‘ANAMIKA’ my very best wishes on the
occasion oftheir forthcoming festival. Anything that brings out the cultural life of

Our country must be supported and applauded.
