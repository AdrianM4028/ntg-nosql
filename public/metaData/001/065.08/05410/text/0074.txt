The best simile that I can make is that the actor throws a thread, as it were, out into the house which,

if the house is receptive, it will catch. Then it is the actor’s business to hold that thread taut and to keep
a varying and consequently interesting presence on it, so that it is really pulled in moment of tension and

Tyrone Guthrie

A great audience is not even a collection ofgreat men. It is an assembly offully human beings with some.
thing in common, something relevant to the occasion. Aduiences at concerts and dance recitals are often a

good deal better than audiences at plays, for they have come together not as people who demand to be amused
but as people interested in music or dance. Even this degree of solidarity is rare enough. Lack of community is a problem not of our arts but of our whole civilization”.
