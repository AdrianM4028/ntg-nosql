The THEATRE is
mortal quarrels.
The THEATRE is a beloved woman, sometimes capricious, ill-tempered, ugly and selfish ; sometimes
fascinating, tender, generous and beautiful.

The THEATRE is an adored child, unconsciously cruel and artlessly charming. His whims demand
everything and you cannot frefuse him anything. The theatre is a second home, it nourishes you and it
drains all your forces.

The THEATRE is a source of heartaches and of immeasurable joys.
The THEATRE is air and wine, which we must breathe infrequently and be intoxicated by. Anyone
who experiences this deep and rapturous emotion will not escape the theatre ; anyone who is indiﬂbrent to
it had better aviod this beautiful and cruel art.

An yet the theatre as an institution contains elements ofpopular education, primarily aesthetic education, for
the masses. This then is the dread poser which you contemplate taking into your hands ,- a responsibility
will be laid upon you to handle this power in the right way.
Stanislavski’s speech to Moscow Art Theatre, March, 1911.
