जनता am शत्र७
Janata Ka Shatru (The Enemy of the People) was another Hindi play
The
staged by Anamika in Calcutta as their annual offering...
production was such and the team worked as one man to make
the play a success.

आषाढ़ का एक दिन
प्रश्न था कि इतना जटिल और सूक्ष्म भावभूमिवाला नाटक रंगमंच पर सफल हो
पायेगा कि नहीं l अनामिका ने मेहनत, ईमान्दारी, सूझबूझ और कलात्मक अभिरुचि
से इस नाटक के आंतरिक सौन्दर्य को रंगमंच पर उतारने की चेष्टा की । m ' ' ‘ नाटक
बहुत सफल रहा । दर्शकों ने मुक्तकाठ से प्रशंसा की ।
…धर्मयुग, १ ९ ६ ०

I have just seen 'Anamika’s latest Hindi play, Ashar Ka Ek Din.
The success or failure of such a daringly unconventional Hindi
play depends solely on acting 8 direction with proper understanding neither was lacking.

दृराते-छाशंते
If we really had to stop the press in order to say a few lines about
Anamika's excellent drama ‘Chhapte-Chhapte' (Stop Press) we
would have done it with the greatest pleasure.
Because, here
was a progressive group of amateurs doing something revolutionary

In the annals of Indian stage. Though darging they did discard
the age old curtain that separated the performers and the audience.
