You may call it a saga of Government bureaucracy.

A tree in the lawn of Government’s

commerce Department fell on a man. There
starts the story—how to get rid of the tree—or
the man . . . Answer seems not to be an easy one.

Krishen Chander, the proliﬁc writer in Hindi
& Urdu satirically slaps once more on the
cruel face of bureaucracy.
