Sewak has brought out the socio—political contradictions underlined in the play through a
very young cast (who) showed an impressive sense of timing and music.... Each aspect of theatre

craft had been well taken care of.

—”The Tribune” Chandigarh
The success of Nayyar’s production was that it was propped up imaginatively and presented
in a refreshing manner.... The play was enacted well with the actors giving their best and Nayyar

himself playing the Sutradhar with ease.

नाटक का थीम है---- सत्ता भ्रष्ट करती है और पूर्ण सत्ता पूर्ण रूप से भ्रष्ट कर देती है I
…"पंजाब कंसरी" जालन्धर
Nayyar’s deft handling of the very complex theme deserves appreciation. The scenes depicting a public meeting, the working in an office, the bling men’s frentic but half-hearted search of the

elephant..... and the cold-blood murder of the Sutradhar... left an everlasting impact.
—”Dai|y Excelsior” Jammu
Presented in an experimental form, the play brought out the theme very effectively. Nayyar’s

use of the symbol of five chairs painted like a chess-board with the motifs of spades, hearts, dia—
monds and clubs and a big question mark on the fifth conveyed that politics in the present day world
was no better than any other game.
