MESSAGE
I am extremely delighted to know that the young

and upcoming artists and art lovers dedicated to the art of
theatre in the State, under the guidance and patronage of a
person of the stature of Sewak Nayyar', have formed a theatre group under the name of Yavnika Theatre Group.

Performing arts not only mould and change the behaviour of a community for a cultural cohesion, but also

channelise the creative and innovative thinking of youth
towards fuller development of their personality.
Invigorating the theatre movement in the State at a
time when the values, ethos and ethics are being replaced
by chauvinism, ambivalence and petty considerations, is

more so necessitated to bring about cultural and emotional
integration.

On this occasion I send my good wishes and hope
that Yavnika Theatre Group will definitely rise to the
occasion.

December 26, 1996.
