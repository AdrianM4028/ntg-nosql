MESSAGE
I am glad to know that Sewak Nayyar and his fellowartists have finally decided to organise their theatre activities
and run the same under ”Yavnika Theatre Group”.
Eversince 1967 (when we both ioined the University as
students of English literature), I have observed in Sewak an
insatiable desire to whole-heartedly serve and promote the cause
of Theatre.
Many of his plays have been sponsored by our Centre
and have always brought us laurels wherever staged.
I wish ’Yavnika’ a great success.

Sd/29th January, I 996.
