MESSAGE
I am happy that the Yavnika Theatre Group is

being formed under the aegis of Shri Sewak Nayyar.
Drama as an art form has a long tradition as a
source of enioyment, cultural enrichment as well as a
vehicle for conveying a social and political message.
Having seen one of the plays put up by
Shri Sewak Nayyar, I can testify to the high standard
of acting and its entertainment value. I am sure the

standards they have set for themselves will be
maintained and surpassed.

| wish the Theatre Group success in all its
presentations.
