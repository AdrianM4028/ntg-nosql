With the passage of time and experience and suffering the
pangs of separation from her husband, Rajmati grows into maturity.
With great devotion of a Sati she burns in her heart for her beloved
husband. With eyes turned into stone-marbles, as it were, she yearningly and wistfully keeps on gazing at the dust on the road that led to
Orissa. Profoundly heart-smitten and unable to bear the grief, she sends
one of her confidants, Damodarji to Orrissa in search of her husband.

In the mean while, Bisaldeo taking the guise of a servant, was
working at the palace of the King of Orissa. When he comes to know
the truth of the matter about Bisaldeo, he sends him back with great
honour to his kingdom and brings about the re-union of Rajrnati and
Bisaldeo.

The play, “If I were to tell the Truth...” being presented, is, as a
matter of fact, a modern form of allegory. Rajasthani and Malavi cultural forms and the folk machi style of Gwalior have been artistically
fused in the form of total theatre. This musical play containing dancerecitals as well gives a mixed pattern combining the traditional and
modern styles of presentation.
