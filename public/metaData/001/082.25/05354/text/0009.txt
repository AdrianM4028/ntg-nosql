A Telugu Classic Play Written by Mahakavi
Sri. GURUJADA APPARAO
This great play is the first original Drama written in spoken
Telugu language about a hundred years ago.
Even after a hundred
years it is still drawing packed houses and acclaimed as the greatest
play ever written in this language. it was translated into many world
languages also. The characters created by the author are ever living
and even today we can identify them among those that move around
us.
The author was moved by the pitiable condition of women in
those days, especially young children who were being sold by the
parents in the name of marriage for attractive dowries (Kanyasulkam
means girl dowry). In their greed unscrupulous parents used to marry
very young girls to very old men.

The

result was,

that

many young

girls were widowed

even

before they attained puberty.
He wanted to point this out to the society and selected the
medium of stage and used spoken language so as to be able to reach
the . masses.
He was very successful in his attempt and was highly
praised by public and press.
This year the centenary of the play is celebrated with zeal all
over Andhra Pradesh, & South Central Zone Cultural Centre is organising Theatre Festival in its four member states, to co-memorate the centenary year of Kanyashulkam Telgu play.
