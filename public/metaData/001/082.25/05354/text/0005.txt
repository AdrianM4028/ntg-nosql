“SANCH KANHU TO”
(“If I were to tell the Truth ........ ”)
BY DR. PRABHAKAR SHROTRIYA

The well known poet Narapati Nalha belonged to the age of
heroism and bravery, and wrote his immortal piece ‘Bisaldeo Raso.’ Dr.
Prabhakar Shrotriya has designed the play “If l were to tell the Truth"
on the basis of ‘Bisaldeo Raso’ originally written in Dingal style of

Rajasthan.
The theme of the play revolves round the character of Rajmati,
the daughter of the king Raja Bhoj. Rajmati was wedded to the Ajmer
King Bisaldeo Chavan, when she was of a very tender age. (She was
innocent and greatly interested in various games suited to her age.
She was not at all aware of her responsibilities as a wife. She treats
even her husband Raja Bisaldeo only as a play mate. By her pranks
