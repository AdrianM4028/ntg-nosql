Keeping all the elements of the original play and its complexity,
KINNARA MELA has made an attempt in communicating it in a way so
as to enable the general mass to grasp its fundamentals.
Translated by Akshara

Music by Gururaja Marpalli

Directed by K.G. Krishna Murthy.

‘KlNNARA MELA, TUMARI, KARNATAKA

ANDHER NAGARI CHOWPAT RAJA
BY BHARATENDU
The play is an adaptation of Bharatendu’s Hindi version Andher
Nagari Chowpat Raja. The play deals with the foolishness of a king
who ultimately hangs himself in the vain hope of realising heaven trig-

gers by certain events that spring from the death of a goat due to a
wall collapse.
The music, the design and the style of the production is aimed
at reaching general audience.

Translated by N.S.Venkataram
Music and Directed by Druvaraj Deshpande.
