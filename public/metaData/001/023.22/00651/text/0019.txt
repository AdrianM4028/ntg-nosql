Make-up is an essential part of every Theatrical performance, since

without it the actors’ faces would appear too ﬂat.

It is by make-up that we

can stimulate the distinct features of any given character; and, moreover, by

using mono-coloured compositions, make-up can be made to blend and
harmonise with the general effect of the stage-settings.

When Mr. R. G. Anand asked me to make-up the actors for this
production, I calculated that, since there were 25 actors, it would take me

at least 4 hours to complete the task, even if I gave no more than 10 minutes

to each actor.
Since this group is concerned with teaching all aspects of theatre and
theatre craft to its members, I thought I could not do better than to teach the
actors the art of make-up for themselves. I gave several demonstrations

and, as a result, the actors have been able to make—up themselves for this

performance, leaving me only to give them the ﬁnishing touches.
