In designing the costumes, and in the selection of
their colours though I have tried to be authentic,
yet my main effort has been to use them as an
instrument to express the underlying spirit of a particular scene or mood. Kumargiri’s appearance in
the court in a black robe rather than in Jogia, which
he actually might have used, is to create the tense
effect that is related to the scene and of which
he personally is to be a symbol.

As to the designs, in these I have tried to look
more towards the sculptural records of Gupta period
rather than to accept the beaten track. To my
understanding the dresses used in most of the
representations have been inspired
mythlogical
entirely by the Deccan School which I found difﬁcult to accept wholesale. It is particularly so in
cases of dhotis and head dresses. No achievement
is claimed. I only hope that this experiment may

result in further and much more successful attempts
by more talented brains.
