production.

I rushed over to the Principal and, in great agitation, explained

my position to him—the long and laborious

rehearsals,

the arrangements

already made, the great expenses incurred, the impossibility of changing this
important role at such a late stage.

The Principal, however, coolly pointed

out to me that he had had great experience in staging plays and had himself
changed casts overnight many a time; and that, in short, I couldn’t have my

actor.

I left him, much despondent, and knowing that now there was nothing

for it but to cancel the whole thing.

But the actor would not agree to this;

he said he was ready to give up his Government scholarship and leave the
College, but not to leave his role in this production. Needless to say, I

hesitated to accept his offer; but he insisted, continued with rehearsals and was
duly expelled by his Principal. I am still feeling guilty about it.

One actor was transferred from Delhi
in the middle of rehearsals, another fell ill, a third disappeared for a week, a
fourth had to attend a marriage. But this sort of thing is taken for granted
There were many other troubles.

in all amateur theatre, and I am afraid will have to continue being taken for
granted as long as our theatre remains amateur.
A word about the sets: the play calls for so many changes of scene that
it was a problem how to elfect them, without continuously trying the audience’s

patience by long delays and lowered curtains.

We had, therefore, to devise

a set which could be quickly and easily adapted and changed into various
guises with a minimum of delay.
I wish to thank Shri F. C. Mathur for helping me adapt the play, and
Shri S. S. Thakur for helping me with the Hindi language.
