PRODUCER’S NOTE

It was in about 1928, and in Lahore, that I attended
performances by a professional theatre company of Sita Banbas
and Ganesh Janam and last saw the old Parsi theatre in its true
grandeur.

And

it did have

a grandeur—With its spirited

mixture of prose, verse, dance and song, which stimulated the
audience into loud bursts of appreciation.

The performances

of these plays would start about 9.30 at night and go on till
3 or 4 in the morning.

The length of the play depended on

the enthusiasm of the audience, for a really appreciative audience
would call for continued encores of striking scenes : so that it
was not uncommon for an actor to die and, to

loud cries of

“once more i” from a delighted audience, rise again in order
to die again, and so rise and so die, on and on till the audience
was sated with its own catharsis.

Later this form of theatre fell into disrepute, not through
any fault of its own but through that of its many imitators,
who took over its form without its spirit and thus degraded
what had once been a potent dramatic vehicle into a mere
bundle of outworn tricks.

Nayya Mori is an attempt to revive something of the
spirit of the original Parsi theatre.
I have not hesitated

And as in this theatre,

to intersperse my

prose

with

verse

and my verse with song and my song with dance, and again
as in this theatre, my success—or lack of it—can be gauged

only by the spontaneous response of a theatre-loving audience.
