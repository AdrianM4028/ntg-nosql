about

the

P1ay
Nayya Mori is a satire on the social
life in the capital. The strength of the play

lies in the fun it pokes at the contemporary
setting.

The businessman seeking import

and export permits, the artiste yearning to

be “sponsored” on a trip abroad, relatives

of high ofﬁcials, the “contact man” trying
to exploit all situations, parents and PurOhatS:

and ﬁnally our ‘modern’ boys and girls

they are all the subjects of caricature in this
comedy. And although many digs have
been made at them, the entire play is free

of any malice or prejudice.

Perhaps the

only ones left out are the contractors and
critics in New Delhi.
