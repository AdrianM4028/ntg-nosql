'ELECTIONS’. HUM-HINDUSTANI‘ and ‘TALAAQ’ have been staged and are still

SPLIT & R E - EM ER G E N CE.
In 1957, over the issue of staging a memorial play in the centenary year of

the First War of Independence, the group had to split from 1. N. T. It emerged as
INDRAPRASTHA THEATRES and presented R. G. Anand’s DILLI-JALLI which
was adjudged as the best production of the year. The late Dr. Charles Fabri, drama
critic of the ‘Statesman' remarked in the opening sentence of his review:
'We have had a number of plays on the anniversary of 1857 uprising,
none of them of any great merit, alas! Mr. R. G. Anand’s new play
DILLI-JALLI’ (Delhi is burning) is without doubt the best so far
offered."
AS WE MARCH ON.,.....
Since its emergence as INDRAPRASTHA THEATRES, there has been no
looking back. The Theatre marched on with Bhagwati Charan Verma‘s CHITRALEKHA. R. G. Anand‘s and Fiqr Taunsvi’s 'NAYYA MORl’, & ‘DARBAR - E.
AKBARI’, and R. G. Anand’s and Prern Jullundry’s punjabi opera ‘SASSIPUNNU'. The Theatre encouraged Dina Nath Zutshi to produce ‘RET- TE PATTHAR’. T. P. Jain to produce ‘MERA KHWAB', Rajnder Nath to produce
‘EK SE EK BADA’ and BHAUNCHAL'. It sponsored Adakaar of Calcutta’s presentations of R6. Anand’, ‘BHAUNCHAL' and Arnrit Rai’s ‘CHINDIYON Kl-EK-JHALAR’,
and IPTA’s ‘SHATRANJ KE MOHRE’ - after its own successful presentation of the
ﬁrst Hindustani Opera ‘MERl SHATABDI’ written by R. G. Anand and Fiqr Taunsvi.
