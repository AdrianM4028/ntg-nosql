25 yeats of Indraprastha Theatres

R. G. ANAN D needs no introduction to Delhi thea-

tre audiences.

An architect by profession, he has always

had the keenest interest in the theatre and since 1947,
when he arrived in Delhi from Lahore, he has been res-

ponsible for as many as 25 productions. He is an outstanding playwright as well as an outstanding producer
and has already written ﬁfteen plays.

In 1951 he_instituted the Anand Award and won it
himself for आँहैंहक्षहां producer", with his production of
“VIVAH BANDHAN”. as well as with that of his own
play “‘AZADI”, again for “best producer” and for best
playwright with his play “HUM HINDUSTANI" and
as “best playwright" and 2nd Producer with his own
play “DILLI JALLI”.

Politics have since dimmed the shine of the Anand
Awards and the ‘Shields' instituted by him appear to be
lying in the cold storage of Delhi Natya Sangh.

R. G. Anand has been the main driving force behind

Indraprastha Theatres.

His enthusiasm is unbounded,

so is his energy even at his age of 62. He personally sup-

ervises and, more often than not. carries on singlehanded every detail of production and presentation.
