transcendental living. They have naturally taken halp of our ancient scriptures and

find solace in them. It is time that we should give up the false adopted values of
life.

This has made the life of every individual unhappy. When thelif'e of indivi-

duals bec'om'eiunhappy, the Nation becomes unhappy. Janet Barkas. an American,

writing in The Illustrated weekly on July I 4 1974, says that

"There is something

compelling about (Indians) ability to be satisÔ¨Åed with so little". It is this ability
which was the strongest point of our character. It is this achieve happiness in their
lives.

I wanted to convey this message that concept and practice of free sex and re-

lations between husband and wife as prevalent in the glossy fringe of Western society are totally unnatural to us. This type of sex-orientated relations have been
injected into our society by back-wash of libertine literature and cheap phoney misadventures on the celluloid of the West. My media being theatre. I naturally
thought of writing a play. There was but one danger; the play becoming more of
a sermon, and thus losing its entertaining value and its message. It is for this reason
that I wrote this play as a comedy. I conceived the entire plot but then took the
help of my dear friend Shri S.S. Greeb, to write the dialogues. It is a joint effort
of both of us. to show that it is the simple and pure living of ours, which can give
ths peace and the tranquility which one yearns for, and not the pursuits of anima-

listic and carnal desires.

How far we haAe succeeded is but for you to judge.
