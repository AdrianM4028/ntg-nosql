My dear Mohonji,
Thank you for your letter of 24th January, 1981 and I am
delighted to know that you are presenting a stage-adaptation
of ‘Rajula-Malushahi’.
I have no doubt that this presentation will be symbolic of
the Kamoan monntains and the rich simplicity of the people
of these hills. Rajula-Malushahi—l believe is one of the
great Indian ballods which has a message of both endurance
and love. I have heard this song in the hills of Almora and
I hope that your adaptation will bring these immortal songs to
life again.

On this occasion I would also like to remember and pay
homage to my friend Mr. ID. Sati.
With all good wishes,

Yours sincerely,
Kapila Vatsyayan
