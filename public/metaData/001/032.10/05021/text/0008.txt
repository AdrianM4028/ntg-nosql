I am glad to know that the Parvatiya Kala Kendra, New
Delhi, is staging ‘Rajula-Malushahi’ on February 26-28, 198].
The Himalayas have provided the perennial fountain head of
our natural resources: like—wise the people and their myth legend
and arts embody messages which are eternal.
The Rajula-Malushahi of Kumaon and Garhwal hills is
pervasive and its melodies reverberate through the hills and
forests. I am happy that the stage adaptation of this famous
ballad is being presented in Delhi.

I wish the stage adoptation of. the
success.
