I am So happy that the. Parvatiya Kala Kendra is
organising “Rajula-Malushahi” on 26th, 27th and 28th
February, 1981.
It is heartening that your association is p0pularising
the ﬁner aspects of Himalayan arts with reference to Kumaon
and Garhwal. Our people have been in the forefront not only
in the defence forces but they have shone on the ﬁlament of
the cultural horizon also. Please do keep it up.

Your sincerely
