"O God ! Lead me from darkness to light"
is
EMan’s eternal guest. For light is life. And light
ty torches,
our business. With a production line of quaii
dry cells and miniature bulbs

Right since independence
(
GEEP’S founder, Late Mr. M.R. Shervani, realised
that portable light source W ll continue to be
one of the basic necessities थि।" hundreds of millons of
Indians, especially where other fruits of
progress will be slower to reach

GEEP is now playing a much wider role
Guided by the philesophy of its founder of delivering
the masses from darkness of fear
ignorance and backwardness. Subserving
everything else to common good
