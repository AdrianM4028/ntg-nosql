PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSES

IN A NUTSHELL
Most of us were blindly working in theatre in our
respective regions, where exposure to the modern theatre activity is not available. The workshop is a pleasant
shock for us. We suddenly realised that theatre is a systernatic activity, involving various skills. The rigorous
training process has moulded us into different personalities. So many subjects and skills were taught to us in a
short time, begining from the very basics and leading to
practicals. Surprisingly, we could grasp all of them too.
The workshop has changed our very attitude towards
theatre. We realised that each department in theatre is
as important as acting.‘ Our aproach to acting also has
changed. Now, we are looking forward to use What we
have learnt here, in our respective places. We hope our
co-workers, who are not fortunate enough to go through
this workshop, can understand our changed View of theatre.

One of the most important aspects that we have
learnt here is punctuality. We have learnt discipline here.
The dedication and passion of all the teachers, especially
the camp director's clarity of purpose and sense of humour have made such a rigorous process of training a
terriﬁc, enjoyable experienCe.
