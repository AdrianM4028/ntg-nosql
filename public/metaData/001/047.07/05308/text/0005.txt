CAST

ABOUT THE PLAY
It is a re-doing of Jean Anouilh in the
context of the ongoing social and

political scenario of Manipur. And,
Sophocles remains as a propelling
force emanating its ideological content
of victims of state terrorism rising
against the state and its forms of
oppression. Kreon has just crushed a
rebellion against the state. The dead

body of Polinices is left thrown in the

open and is forfeited of all, the rites and
rituals. Kreon hopes this act of
punishment could bring an everlasting
solution to the problem of rebellion.

But very unexpectedly the threat to
state terrorism comes from a very
unassuming little girl, Antigone. Defying
the decree set by the. state she has
covered the dead body of her brother
Polinices with a few handfuls of dust.
Instead of succumbing to the
suggestions of her uncle Kreon to
hush up, Antigone takes the matter to
the streets.
