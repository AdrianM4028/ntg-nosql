The Return
SAADAT HASAN MANTO

The special train left Amritsar at two in the afternoon, arriving at Mughalpura,
Lahore, eight hours later. Many had been killed on the way, a lot more injured
and countless lost.
It was at 10 o’clock the next morning that Sirajuddin regained consciousness. He was lying on bare ground, surrounded by screaming men, women
and children. It did not make sense.
He lay very still, gazing at the dusty sky. He appeared not to notice the
confusion or the noise. To a stranger, he might have looked like an old man
in deep thought, though this was not the case. He was in shock, suspended,
as it were, over a bottomless pit.
Then his eyes moved and, suddenly, caught the sun. The shock brought him
back to the world of living men and women. A succession of images raced
through his mind. Attack . . . fire . . . escape . . . railway station . . . night . .
Sakina. He rose abruptly and began searching through the milling crowd in
the refugee camp.

He spent hours looking, all the time shouting his daughter’s name . . .
Sakina, Sakina . . . but she was nowhere to be found.
Total confusion prevailed, with people looking for lost sons, daughters,
mothers, wives. In the end Sirajuddin gave up. He sat down, away from the
crowd, and tried to think clearly. Where did he part from Sakina and her
motherPThen it came to him in a flash—the dead body of his wife, her
stomach ripped open. It was an image that wouldn’t go away.
Sakina’s mother was dead. That much was certain. She had died in front
of his eyes. He could hear her voice: ‘Leave me where I am. Take the girl away.’
