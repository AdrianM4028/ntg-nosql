At night, he would pray for the success of the young men who were looking

for his daughter. Their words would ring inhis ears: ‘If your daughter is alive,
we will find her.’
Then one day he saw them in the camp. They were about to drive away.
‘Son,’ he shouted after one of them, ‘have you found Sakina, my daughter?’
‘We will, we will,’ they replied all together.
The old man again prayed for them. It made him feel better.
That evening there was sudden activity in the camp. He saw four men
carrying the body of a young girl found unconscious near the railway tracks.
They were taking her to the camp hospital. He began to follow them.
He stood outside the hospital for some time, then went in. In one of the
rooms, he found a stretcher with someone lying on it.
A light was switched on. It was a young woman with a mole on her left
cheek. ‘Sakina,’ Sirajuddin screamed.
The doctor, who had switched on the light, stared at Sirajuddin.
‘I am her father,’ he stammered.
The doctor looked at the prostrate body and felt for the pulse. Then he said
to the old man: ‘Open the window.’
The young woman on the stretcher moved slightly. Her hands groped for
the cord which kept her shalwar tied round her waist. With painful slowness,
she unfastened it, pulled the garment down and opened her thighs.
‘She is alive. My daughter is alive,’ Sirajuddin shouted with joy.
The doctor broke into a cold sweat.
