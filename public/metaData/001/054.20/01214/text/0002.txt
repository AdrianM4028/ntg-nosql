From Maya
This is not so much an exercise in story telling or reliving a scgching
story as an attempt to create an experience for myself and the audieme,\ ५

drawing from Manto’s tale of a father's search for his daughter. Single
actions may have no particular meaning but resonances that create

multiple meanings. Throughout in preparing this programme I kept
trying physical actions to generate that range of thought and emotions
that are part of the atmOSphere of the story (reproduced elsewhere in
this brochure).
In creating this piece I was strongly tugged by the idea that a father
can become his daughter, so deep is his anguish, and that he finds her
in the movement of his body. He finds her in himself, he finds her in
dance.
A question for me was how to shift dance energy to a mornent in a
person’s life when words are not being used to signal the transition——
after all it is these slips that make up the transition from Sirajuddin to
Sakina.
In great part I owe this piece to my awareness of Kathakali which I
have practised over several years. Kathakali has a codified language of
mudras with specific meanings on which I have tried to draw. However, here I am looking for a physical language, where every action may
set off different meanings or experiences, and the eventual form is not
Kathakali .
Reena Mohan, the National Award winning filmmaker, Roy, a
talented young theatre director, and Vikrarn Joglekar, a well-known
sound designer of the alternative cinema, have worked with me as a
team on this production, as did Ein Lal at an early stage. I am grateful
to them.
I am also grateful to Sadanam Balakrishnan, my Kathakali guru.
