Directorial notes:
If we offend, it is with our good will.
That you should think, we come not to offend,
But with good will. To show our simple skill,
That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then we come but in despite.
We do not come as minding to contest you,

Our true intent is. All for your delight
We are not here. That you should here repent you,
The actors are at hand and by their show
You shall know all that you are like to know.
Shakespeare's A Mid—summer Nights Dream provides immense scopefor
any actor to push themselves beyond their limitation, explore and exploit
their potential to the maximum. My aim in doing this production is to
challenge and encourage students to incorporate all the mental, physicall
and vocal theatre discipline rendered to them during their SRC training
period and approach this production in a modern, contemporary manner

in a minimalistic way . This is my dream for the Mid summer Nights
dream.

The Play 3 Midsummer Night's Dream
A Midsummer Night's Dream is a romantic comedy by William
Shakespeare, suggested by "The Knight's Tale "from Geoffrey Chaucer's
The Canterbury Tales, written around 1594 to 1596. It portrays the
adventures offour young Athenian lovers and a group of amateur actors,
their interactions with the Duke and Duchess of Athens, Theseus and
T‘Iippolyta, and with thefairies who inhabit a moonlitforest. The play is
one of Shakespeare 's most popular works for the stage and is widely

performed across the world.
