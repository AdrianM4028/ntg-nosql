agitation and vilence in youth.
But at the deeper level it talks about the basic human
emotions. A human to human relationships and causes of
youth voilance and than their bigger connection with
present politics, taliour of education system, corruption at
all level of system.
It strongly speaks about the connection between failure
at system and voilence in youth and than manipulation of
youth power energy for the benefits at the core system.
The constractive energy of youth- its change in distractive
energy and then its result in violence aginst sell. The play is
very raugh in nature, very direct & sharp in language and
very deep at the level of emotion.
