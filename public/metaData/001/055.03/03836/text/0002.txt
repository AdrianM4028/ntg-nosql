DIRECTOR’S NOTE
In my journey into diverse theatrical experiments over
the years has made me more concerned about the
ancient idea of theatre as “Drishya Kavya” or - “Visual
Poetry”. Since last 13 years as well as well as in the
present production “lHAMRlG” my concern has been to
understand the meaning of “Drishya without, of course,
undermining their power as dramatic. A theatrical
presentation to my mind is essentially something which
should touch the senses.

IHAMRlG has been a good exercise for the SRC 2nd

to work, to find meaning in both over and underlying as
a part of their training. I hope this production has been
an enriching experience for the students as it has been
for its Director.
A performance is an extension of this thread to a three
dirnentional tangible experience where contexts &
references emerge & vanish while the body of the
porduction enjoys independent life and dies with the

curtain fall every evening. And what it should leave with
us is images, not pictorial but theatrical.
