Director's Note
Well No, It Is Not Another Theatrical Depiction Of The Enchanting Story Of Lord
Rama As The Name Suggests "RAMLEELA" It Is Rather Very Much A Different
Story Narrating A Different "Leela" Set In A typical North City The Play Written By A
Well Known Playwright "RAKESH", Is A Social Cum Political Satire. Chronicling The
Events And Forces That Transform An Apparently Friendly. Hindu Muslim Slum

Dwellers Communities Who Collaborate To Produce A "RAMLEELA" Into Two
Volatile And Hostile Communities Of Hindus And Muslims And Consequent Riot.
The play Tries To Expose The True Beneficiaries Of Such Social Intolerance And

Makes A Case For Unity And Communal Harmony.
Through Characters That Are Good And Evil, Gullible As Well As Shrewd. It Is One
And A Half Hour Musical Production Of Intense Emotional Drama With Several Truly

Poignant Moments.
Time Spent On Dealings With An Issue That We Do Not Generally Deal With
Considering Our Self-Belief Of Apparent Immunity From Lower Class Problems. In

A Way, It Is Also Time Spent On Checking If We Are Still H urnan .
I would like to say thanks too Mrs. Panna Bharat Ram ii for giving me chance to do

musical production with students of second year Acting course and I would like to
thank the entire staff of Sh ri Ram Centre for their co-operation with us.
