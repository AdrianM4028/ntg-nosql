Pﬂessage

I am glad to know that a cultural, social and
non-commercial organisation under the name and
style of ‘Theatre Unique’ has been formed to promote
such activities in the capital. It is a good idea to
provide diversion from the boredom of daily ennui.
I hope that Theatre Unique will be able to meet this
requirement for the benefit of citizens of Delhi.
I wish the

Organisation

all

success

in its

endeavours.

(SHER SINGH)

Shri Trilok Chand Bansal,
