a means not an end

At DLF, growth is not an end by itself. But a means to achievement. To a

commitment that is shared by the people who man the corporation. An aspiration to contribute in their own little way to happiness and growth.
Its real estate division. DLF United looks back to its pioneering effort in
extending Delhi’s boundaries. South Extension, Greater Kailash—l and II,
Hauz Khas — a host of prestige residential colonies owe their existence to its
indefatigable determination. A ﬁre that still burns as DLF prepares to bring
more land and housing within reasonable reach of the common man who is

embattled by skyrocketing prices.
American Universal, its manufacturing division gears itself to setting entrepreneurs in business by building special FHP motors for a growing range of
new appliances. Atta chakkis in Gujarat, wet rice grinders in the South, desert
coolers in the North, air conditioners, computers etc. etc . . . . And a range of
useful consumer durables. Ceiling fans, mini fans, cooler pumps and cooler
fans.
A diverse spectrum. A broad vision bound together by its common objective
of ceaseless striving for perfection and growth. Meaningful growth.
