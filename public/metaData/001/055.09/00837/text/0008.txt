Sixth Playwrights’ Workshop

The primary objective of this series of Playwrights' Workshops has

considerations, in the fifth workshop the plays were ﬁrst read by the
playwrights and then discussed. Four plays were chosen for staging.

directors to the extent it was possible. After the plays were staged
then each one of them was discussed by a larger group of theatre
people including, of course, the plawrights, directors and actors.
For the present workshop, in the ﬁrst phase, six plays were read
by a panel of three persons (Shri N. C. Jain, Shri Govind Deshpande
and Shri Rajinder Nath). Two plays were selected for productions.
Detailed suggestions and comments of this panel were communicated
to the two playwrights who in turn re—wrote the plays after which the
rehearsals commenced. The collaboration process did not end there.
The authors were actively involved during the production period.

actors to evolve a play has been really very signiﬁcant in this workshop
and hopefully it is going to be very intense and extensive in the future
workshops which Shri Ram Centre is planning to have.
