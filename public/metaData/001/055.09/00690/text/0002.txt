Vijay Tendulkar's play ’Panchhi' is about the status
of woman in urban middle class society. Overwhelmed ५.
by moral codes and a decadent social order, where
woman is a mere chattel to be exploited by all
for one reason or another, she is expected to go '
through life stoically.
'
The pathos and tragedy of everyday life—’Panchhi' is
all about that.

'Panchhi Aise Aate Hain' has been staged earlier on
many occasions. It was for Bansi Kaul the Director of
this production to conceive and present it in an
altogether new and interesting form.
The movements in the play often border on the

farcical and the sets are exaggerated. The Chorus which
appears on stage singing dialogues, making social
comments and highlighting the punch lines,
is an exciting innovation.
