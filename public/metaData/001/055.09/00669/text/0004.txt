First Performance:

Tuesday. May 5. 1987
at the Shri Ram Centre

Shri Ram Centre is conducting a series of Playwrightsâ€™
Workshops. In the first workshop seven playwrights participated. All the plays in this workshop were based on some
Indian literary work. Rajesh Joshi's play Achchhe Aadmi is
the outcome of this workshop.
We are grateful to Ford Foundation for their support for
these workshops.
