ABOUT THE NEW INTIMATE THEATRE lSAMMUKH’

Here we are ready with our new production of year 2002 ’Dimage Hasti,
Dil Ki Basti, Hai Kahan- Hai Kahan’ a new original Hindi Play by
Mahendra Bhalla, fortunately we are premiering it at our intimate theatre
"SAMMUKH" (Face to Face) which has been recently constructed in our
own campus Bahawalpur House. Soon after production, our Rep. Co. will
be shifting from Rabindra Bhawan ot Bahawalpur House and our studio
theatre will be in possasion of Sahitya Academy. However both organisation
have agreed to keep studio theatre in its present condition as it has been
since last 40 years a venue of important theatre events. Where as Meghdoot
The Open Air Theatre will remain with N.S.D. and our productions designed
for open air will regularly be staged there.

While designing "SAMMUKH“ we have tried our level best to provide you
with the better version of studio theatre by increasing seating capacity,
entries on both side and regular snacks and tea corner for the audience
during the performances.
We wish that our relationship grown from our intimate studio theatre will
remain the same and "SAMMUKH“ will add more liveliness and freshness
