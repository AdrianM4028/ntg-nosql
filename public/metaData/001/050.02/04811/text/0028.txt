D । R E CTO R ’ 5 NOTE
Three four years back renowned story writer
Mahendra Bhalla, gave me the play ’Dimage Hasti
Dil Ki Basti Hai Kahan Hai Kahan’ for reading one to
my busy schedule I managed to read the play only
after 6-7 months. The slice of our society, which he
has portrayed in this play with utter care and
sensitivity immensely capable of shaking one’s
sensibilities. The script of 160-170 typed pages
appeared quite lengthy. Whenever Bhallaji called up
I was unable to mention that the play being too long
is not suitable for presentation. I did not forget to
mention him that l was deeply moved by the play
his quick response was, ’then, do it’. I realized
that

this play demands matured actors. He suggested me
to do it out of school but while working in school
it
was difficult for me to carry it outside.

The play was read with students, Repertory
artists,
also in Shruti and publised in Rang Prasang.
Bhallaji
agreed that the play needs editing but someh
ow I
never wanted editing which will snatch
out full
scene. I made him agree that I will edit
the
dialogues.

Last 4 to 5 months the play was read
many times
with Repertory actors and it started takin
g shape. On
the ground of ’Aadhe Aadhure’ play deals
with
middle class, middle aged, man,
women relationship,

generation gap, compulsion of having
in small
quibicals so called appartrnents. Adult
s getting settled
abroad leaving their retired parents
finding
themselves as skeletons in social set
up and young
ones getting severly affected by the
breaking up of
family Institution.
It portrays the crisis and complexiti
es of the middle
class. The structure of the play is
having expansion of
an epic and from the point of view
of dramatic
structure it was quite a difficulty
for me. I derived.
Solution to this from the first mono
logue of the main
character where he involves audi
ence with the story
of the play.

The problem came in second last scene where
Kalidaas in an intimate conversation with his wire
Ruchi realises his end and then comes the scene of

Alok’s suicide another major character of the play.

As the production is proceeding the suicide scene in
realistic pattern following Kalidaas’s poetry breaks the
structure, style, feel and rhythem of the play.
Therefore while writing this directorial, I am deciding
that instead of presentation, this scene will come as

information. Thus the end of the play will slowly
although completely change so to go hand in hand
with the production. Although I’m still searching
let’s
see what happens.

I’m thankful to Repertory Company and special
ly
Mr. Robin Das who has designed sets and costum
es
for the play. I am also grateful to Chittranjan
Tripathy for Music and Souti Chakraborty
for his
assistance in direction on. I am more stirred
with the
fact that the first performance of the play
is at NSD
Repertory Company’s new intimat
e theatre

"Sammukh" and it is also very first
production a start
for "Sammukh". After my retirement
from the
directorship of the school. The admini
stration and
Ankur Ii the present director of
the school have gave
me great support & help.
I am slowly getting alienated from
this production.
But I sincerely believes in the
capabilities of this
playwright and another new work
s emerging in
different Indian languages and Hindi
. Dirnage Hasti
Dil Ki Basti Hai Kahan-Hai Kahan
is quite significant
in this way. This much I can. say.
