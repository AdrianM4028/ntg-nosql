Al LADKI
By Krishna Sobti

In recent years, the Hindi short story seemed to have
been shrinking to the margins of literature and to have
lost its centrality as a genre. After the heyday of the nai
Kahani (the New Story) and the Sathottari (post-sixties)
story, there came reports only of some stray bursts from
the frontiers of the short story. But a big bang which truly
shook these frontiers occurred a couple of years ago with
the publications, in the Mahavisheshanka (Mega—Special
issue) of the journal Vartarnan Sahitya (Current Literature),

a new tradition in Hindi of the short novel. Another
characteristic of Sobti' s creativity is that highly conscious

and mindful as she is of her language and technique ,
there yet inheres in it a traditional, popular and regional
element. Thus, her most ambitious novel yet,
Zindaginarna (Life's Chronicle) , is the saga of a whole

race or nation set against a grand historical context.
But Ai Ladaki once again trarnples underfoot all that Sobti
has done before in order to open up a new path. And
what is this new path? In my
