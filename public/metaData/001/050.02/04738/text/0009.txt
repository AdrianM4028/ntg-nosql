llKhalid Ki Khala” is a farce in Urdu with hilarious
comical twists and delightful moments by Begum
Qudsia Zaidi. An adaptation of the English play
Charley's Aunt by Thomas Brandon, the play centers
around 3 college boys in a highly conservative society
that frowns upon any casual mixing between boys
and girls. 50 how the two boys in love profess their
feelings for their beloveds in such a situation, when
they are prohibited from meeting them, and how they
eventually come up with a pretext to meet them while
involving the 3rd boy in their capers are the twists that
lead to a hilarious situation.
Amidst these young love stories, an old long-lost
romance also starts brewing, adding to the confusion
