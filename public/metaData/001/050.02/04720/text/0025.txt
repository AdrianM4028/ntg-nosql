K. Joseph tries to gather more information about his trial from Chamrni
and Uncle from the chief clerk but
They are unsuccessfull. K. also comes

proceedings start, everyone is
present in the court Anna Bi, Salma
Tarafdar as a Christian bride, the
woman, Chammi, Mr 8: Mrs.

across Raunaki, a character, who sup-

Raghupati, his uncle etc. They are d ifferent. They all want to hear K. K.

posed ly supplies money to
Raghupati; he is in a similar predicament as K: a case is on against him
also; but he is of not much help to K.
Then starts his nightmare where his
mind wanders sometimes in the
bank, sometimes in Raghupati’s
house, sometimes in the court. He
decides to fight his case alone
without Raghupati’s help. The court

realizes his case is fabricated, but he

will not defend himself. Joseph is unable to understand this dream where
these people are present and not

present, or are they just demons arising out of his mind’s imagination

who can do him no harm . Joseph K.
continues to fight them towards the

very end.
