ACT-TW0

After Ganesh Vandana the Sutradhar
and the Chorus dressed as Brahmins,
sarcastically describe the highly degenerated and hypocritical conditions of
the society during the rule of Peshwa
chieftan Nana Phadnavis.
The Brahmins arrive at the Kotha of
Gulabi Bai where Nana while dancing
with Gulabi Bai sprains his foot. Gulabi
Baiâ€™s Kannauji Brahmin servant
Ghasiram does not let him fall on the
ground. Nana is highly pleased and
presents him with a necklace.
However Gulabi Bai and the gangsters
of the Kotha forcibly snatch away the
necklace. moreover, Poona Brahmins
conspire to declare Chasiram a thief.
He is publically humiliated and bashed
up by the police. In him rages a fire of
revenge. He uses his beautiful
daughter who is forced to submit to the
lust of Nana in order to secure the
office of the Kotwal for himself.
Chasiram finally becomes the Kotwal.
For Nana it is nothing but a cold
political move.

As a Kotwal Ghasiram indulges in
high handed acts of vengeance. He
turns into a tyrant for his foes, who are

the Brahmins of Puna. In the meantime
Lalita Gauri who had been seduced by
Nana dies in tragic circumstances.
Nana rernarries 7th time and his new
wife is but 12 years old. This shocks
Chasiram. The burning desire to take
revenge crosses all limits. Some
Brahmins who are alleged to have
stolen some fruits are imprisoned in a
small room, where a few of them die of
suffocation. Brahmins raise the banner
of revolt against the Kotwal. Now
Nana also wants to get rid of
Chasiram. Nana orders that Ghasiram
be paraded through the city and
hanged. After the cold blooded killing
of Chasiram Nana delivers a highly
charged speech thus remaining at the
centre of the play.
