with freezes. This helped in accentuating the juxtaposition of the profane
and the sacred and bringing into sharp
focus the topsy-turvy value system
which governed that society then and
which does govern our society now.
It needs to be stated that whatever
changes in form were ultimately incor—
porated in the production would not
have been possible without the
jumping board — I mean the rich theatrical form created by Tendulkar.
(Excerpts from a note written for the 25th show
of the play staged by ABHIYAN on March 24,
1974).

May 1993.
Revivals are risky.
For a play like Chas/ram Kotwa/ the
risk is immense but worth taking.
The first Hindi production of the
play was staged by ABHIYAN in
October 1973. This production has
more or less the same design except
that instead of one Sutradhar this production has two. All the actors are new
except one, Ram Gopal Bajaj, who
played Ghasiram in the earlier production but in this he plays a different
role.
The production team also is more or
less the same except Santwana whose
assistance in the earlier production
was invaluable but imperceptibly,
Without being involved in the production, that contribution to a large extent
remains.

After 20 years I find the play increasingly more relevant for our times. And
this is the reason which makes me call
it a Modern Indian Classic.
