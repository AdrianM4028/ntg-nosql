DIRECTOR'S NOTE
——
This production of Marco Mil—
lions opens on the centennial
birthday of Eugene O’Neill as
part of the world-wide celebrations of the great American
playwright’s genius. Perhaps
one aspect of genius is its ability
to perceive in the present moment an aspect of the human
condition which will, in time,
prevail, and in the creation of
Marco Polo, O’Neill has done
just that. Of course, the opposition between materialism and
the spirit is an eternal one; but in
Marco, O’Neill has prefigured
today’s 'Yuppies' (young up-

wardly-mobile professionals)
who now begin to control money
and power all over the planet.
Marco presents the 'Yuppies' at
their most extreme: their first
thought that of profit; their
education solely job-oriented;
their goal to acquire fashionable
material possessions. The most
severely committed read a few
great books, see little art, nurture

no love of philosophy or concern

for the journey of man’ 5 soul.
These are not bad people~far
from it; but a life of good food,

fine clothing and rented video
cassettes lacks something at the
core, and may even be destructive of others—not through its
actions, but through its lack of

awareness that . man does not
live by bread alone; that living
for something other than self
may be a definition of the human
soul; and that a compassionate
heart is an instrument of pure
love. Prophetically, Marco Mil-

lions may be more apt as a
warning in today’s world than it
was when it was originally
performed. Towards the end of
the play, Kublai Khan teaches his
court a prayer:

'In silence—for one concentrated moment—be proud of life;

know in your heart that the
- living of life can be noble! Know
that the dying of death can be
noble. Be excited by Life. Be inspired by Death. Be humbly
proud ! '
