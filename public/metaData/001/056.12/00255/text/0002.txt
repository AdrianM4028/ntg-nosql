Nat Samrat is a well known Marathi play of the 60's

inspired by Shakespeare’s King Lear. What is interesting
about the play is how the playwright moves away from
the world of kingdom, kings and intrigues and places the
characters in the present day middle class lndian context

and through his sheer dramatic skill succeeds in giving
his central character a poetic and heroic stature.

Furthermore, the play is deeply embedded In the

Maharashtrian ethos.

Therefore it has repeated referen-

ces to speciﬁc Marathi plays, playwrights and actors with

which the Marathi audience would be very familiar and

would have-its own associations

Unfortunately since

we do not have the same kind of parallels in plays,
playwrights and actors in the Hindi

region we have

retained the original references which would be a slight
handicap for the audience here.

Lastly, we have chosen this play not only because
it is an important landmark in Indian

playwriting but

because deepite all its theatricality it presents a very

geniune and sensitive conﬂict between the generations
their values and their life styles which is a vivid reality
of to d ay .
