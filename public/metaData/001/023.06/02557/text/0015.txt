AND MODERN POLITICS
Coriolan us stages a situation with which
we have become familiar, the power

struggle which follows the overthrow
of an absolutist regime. The historical
Coriolanus had had a hand in the
overthrow of the 'I‘arqujns, a dynasty of

tyrants. Roman politics were in flux,
with a struggle beginning between
aristocratic absolutism and demands

for popular representation. Coriolanus
was designed to key into certain aspects
of contemporary political debate. It
raises questions of nationalism, of what
constitutes the nation, and of how the
nation’s best interests can be served. It
therefore bears some relation to recent

events in European affairs, which have
raised similar questions of political
theory for a modern audience.

One of the most frequently-asked
questions in the press last year was
whether the changes which occurred in
Eastern

Europe

amounted

to

a

revolution. A year ago, the post-war

order in Europe was still in place. The
iron

curtain

which,

in

Churchill’s

phrase, had come down across Europe
in the late forties was still intact, and
still able to protect the absolutist
regimes it concealed. Over it, around it

and sometimes through it, two
superpowers with radically different
social orders still confronted each other,
each prophesying the ultimate collapse
of the other.
Yet by September 1990 Douglas Hurd
could speak of a new era of
international co-operation. President
Bush — to little effect — warned an
aggressor that he might no longer play
off the conflict between East and West,
while in Moscow the so-called ‘4 + 2
negotiations’ culminated in the signing
of an agreement giving full sovereignty
to a united Germany Within a year the
curtain had been lifted, co-operation
had replaced confrontation and the
countries of the former Warsaw Pact
were struggling in their various ways to
come to terms with their new socioeconomic orders. Something there is
that doesn’t love a wall.
Ever since the establishment of security
glacis along its western flank, consisting
of countries ’friendly to the Soviet
Union’, there was always the potential
for a change to, or back to, a westernstyle democracy. Socialism on the
soviet model attracted many who

previous year he had
perpetrated a similar
hatchet job on King Lear,

eliminating the Fool and
giving the play a happy
ending in which Cordelia
marries Edgar.)
