We, at the English Shakespeare Company, are naturally delighted to
be making our first visit to India with our four-city engagement in
February. The excitement in the acting company, for most of whom
this will be a first trip, is palpable. India has, of course its own
tradition of Shakespearian touring, and, being the cornrnited
nomads that the ESC are, we are intensely curious not only about
the sights and sounds of the country, but to see how our approach
to Shakespeare, itself a peculiar blend of classical and modern, will
connect with Indian audiences. I doubt if any of our many overseas
ventures has provoked such keen expectations in our own ranks.
