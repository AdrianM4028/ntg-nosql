The Winter's
Tale
leaving aside Henry

VIII, in which he had a
hand. The Winters Tale
was probably
Shakapeare‘s
penultimate play, most
likely written in 1610,

immediately after
Cymbeline and a year
befae The Tempest It
was 'allowed' by Sir
Geage Buc, Master of

the Revels late in 1610
and was seen by Dr.
Simm Faman in May
1611 when it was acted

by the King's Men at the

As long as there is a demand for wool,
there will be sheep. And as long as there
are sheep they will have to be shorn.
Throughout the centuries a romance
has grown up around shearing —
mainly based on prints of jolly
shepherds and comer shepherdesses
sporting and cavorting in some pastoral
arcadia. The reality is somewhat
different. It is bloody hard work. The
strength needed in the thighs and back
is phenomenal. To begin with the sheep
has to be sat on its haunches and
gripped between the knees. It is then
held down on the ground with one
hand and shorn with the other. If you
are ’catching’ and ’handling’ as well —
i,e., catching the sheep in the pen and
lifting it over the hurdle to get it into
position — it means man-handling
some 75-150 lbs of awkward animal.
The days of leisurely hand-clipping a
sheep are long gone, although some
farms still adhere to the old method,
believing it to be less of a shock to the
sheep’s system. Today, with electric
shears, the best boys can shear a sheep
from a standing start in between 30
seconds and a minute, depending on
the size of the sheep. A shearer will
average around 200 sheep in a day and
the best up to 350, earning money per
sheep shorn. At 35 pence a sheep it is a
back-breaking way to earn £50-£100 a
day.
In Australia, where flocks of 25,000 are
not uncommon and sheep-farming is
on
a highly mechanised
and
professional level, there have been
several novel attempts to simplify the
process of shearing, with a singular
lack of success. One development is a
robot shearer that holds the sheep and
turns it to be shorn. Sheep, however, do
not conform in shape and size and
emerge with tufts sticking out all over
the place. The second is a breed of sheep
with a self-shedding coat. Either the
sheep are kept together for long periods
of time until they shed their coats, or a
long trek over the hills is involved,
picking up often wet and muddy
ﬂeeces. (If you can find them). And the

problem arises of what to do with the
other 1,000 breeds.
