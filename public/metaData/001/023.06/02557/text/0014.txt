to the institutionalised tensions between

the classesthan to ideas of unity, stability
or fixed hierarchies. And some felt that
men with a stake in the state would
defend it better than disenfranchised
soldiers or mercenaries.

Of course, the play has at its core a
personal. fam ilytragedy. One of its major
subjects — a commonplace of the time
— is the conflict between the
Renaissance ideal of self-creation. and the
state’s impersonal drive for control over
its members. The state is figured as a
person, individuals as states and
kingdoms: the play is dominated by the
image of the body. But these tussles are
given
modern
applications
for
Shakespeare's day. Though the action
represents the ancient world. it stages
controversies that were of urgent
concern to Jacobean London. An
example is the clash between aristocratic
values and those of the city. between
absolutism and negotiation. We should
not forget that Shakespeare had a foot in
each camp: he was both a royal servant
and. like his father before him. a
businessman. We see Aufidius (like
Octavius in Antony and Cleopatra)
standing for a cynical pragmatism
popularly associated with Machiavelli.
This contrasts with the political naiveté
of Coriolanus. Another clear implication
is that the future belongs to the
politicians. rather than to heroic
dinosaurs, however impressive, from the
epic age.

Many of the speeches in
Coriolanus echo those of

John Ball, one of the
leaders of the l 4th
century Peasants’ Revolt
(recorded by Froissart.
with whose work
Shakespeare was
familiar), and also a
manifesto printed during
the Warwickshire
uprising which railed
against ‘these

encroaching Tyrants who
would grind our flesh
upon the whetstone of
poverty and make our
loyal hearts to faint with
breathing, so that they
may dwell by themselves
in the midst of their
herds of fat wethers'.

The question of how art relates to
politics continues to divide us. Should it
acknowledge its participation in its own
age or aspire to an ideal timelessness? ls
art of its own nature subversive or
conservative? Such questions are still
debated. Shakespeare stages one answer
right at the start of the play, when
Menenius Agrippa calms the starvrng
rebels by 'feeding' them with a story, a
parable. But the play as a whole offers
another way of looking at it. Coriolanus's
folly. we hear, is to act ‘As if a man were
author of himself; And knew no other
kin', and he is ultimately compelled to
acknowledge that his identity is
inseparable from his family and his
nation. Indeed, Coriolanus demonstrates
that every act. however remote. oblique.
or ambiguous — and that includes the
act of writing a play — participates in the
politics of its time. Coriolanus was a
political play when it was first written. It
still is.
