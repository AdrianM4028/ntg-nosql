hearts and minds of the people in
whose name the whole social
apparatus, including coercion, had
been constructed. The People’s Army,
the People’s Police, in the people’s
republic. The potential for change was
there. It erupted into militant action
from time to time and from country to
country but it was always ruthlessly
suppressed — until 1989.

remember with delight Ceausescu's
futile gesturing, his inability to pacify
the rioters with a fable as Menenius
Agripa does in Coriolanus. In the play, of
course, the rioters of ancient Rome
succeed in getting a concessionary
voice in government. It is Coriolanus
who voices the reactionary fear:

The play was ﬁrmly
established by l8l8,
when Coleridge praised
“the wonderfully
philosophic impartiality
of Shakespeare's politics"
and William Hazlitt
considered it to rival the
best political thought of
the age.

observed that the change in Poland took
ten years to accomplish. In Hungary it
took ten months, the GDR needed just
ten weeks and Czechoslovakia just ten
days. It looked for a time as if Romania
might continue the sequence and
require but ten short hours. (It is bitterly
ironic that the pastoral idyll of Bohemia

How right he is! In the latter part of the
twentieth century it has become almost
impossible to impose an absolutist
philosophy on an unwilling nation. In
Romania in 1989, of course, the regime’s

But most of the time resistance
remained latent. Then the people found
their voice, just as they do at the
beginning of the play. In the
demonstrations in Leipzig, Berlin and
Dresden in the autumn of last year, they
chanted in their hundreds of
thousands, "We are the peoplel”. And
those briefly in power in East Berlin for
the first time believed them, and pulled
down the Berlin Wall. And then, of
course, the lid was off. The people
demanded the end of repression, the
end of the one-party system, the end of
the command economy; They wanted
some western -\style dernocrac y instead.
They got their first three demands.
They are now working to achieve the
fourth — those of them, that is, who are
not affected by the structural
unemployment which has resulted
from the change.

The year 1989, commonly tagged A nnus
mirabilis in the press, saw the break-up
of the Warsaw Pact, a radical and
fundamental change in the political
systems of the countries that made up
that alliance and the annulment of the
superpower carve-up of post-war
Europe. The speed and the radical
nature of the change must surely

It has been seen that in all these
countries the significant part of the
change falls within the last twelve
months. So why were the last twelve
months so different from the preceding
forty years? Well, we have a lot to thank
President Gorbachev for: When he
came to power in 1985, he had to deal
with urgent problems in both foreign
relations and home affairs. The
economy at home was failing because,
among other things, the confrontation
with the West meant that the military
was absorbing valuable resources and
restricting the flow of new ideas and
technology into that economy. Mikhail
Gorbachev’s ’New Thinking’ was
designed to reduce arms expenditure
drastically, to replace confrontation
with co-operation, in the hope that
attention might be given to the global
