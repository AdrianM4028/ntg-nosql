The ritual goes on. Championships and
world records for the speed merchants;
sheer grit and hard sweat for the rest.
But the feeling of soft satisfaction as the
fleece is prized away whole from the
warm beating body of the sheep, is
indescribable. As long as there are
sheep, they will have to be shorn.

The collapse of the dairy industry in
Britain over the last few years has
meant that farmers are abandoning
dairy cattle and turning over more and
more of England’s heartland to sheepfarrning once again. Although the great
flocks of the pre-industrial revolution
no longer exist, huge tracts of fine land
have now been taken up again with a
slow moving mass of white wool. There
is accordingly a desperate shortage of
shearers. Scenting the opportunity (and
fun), gangs of Australian and New
Zealand shearers arrive in the spring
and contract themselves out, working
their way slowly up the country.

The shearing season varies from midMay in the warmer south of England to
mid-August way up in the north of
Scotland. Flocks were, and are, sheared
in rota, the same day each year being
allocated to a particular farm. The
whole community would come on that
day (or two, depending on the size of
the flock) to take part. Sometimes as
many as one hundred people would be present, shearing, handling, marking
the sheep (’pitching’), rolling the wool
and all had to be fed. This led to the
great shearing feasts usually taking
place in a barn, with trestle tables
groaning under the weight of legs of
mutton, hams and pies and cakes of all
kinds. Enormous quantities of cider
would be consumed, mainly by the
shearers themselves, replacing lost
body liquid. Then the whole circus
would move on to the next farm. If it
rained, it was a disaster, for a farm
would have to drop out and wait its turn
at the end of the queue.

Shakespeare's principal
source for The Winter's

Greene's romantic novel,
Pandosto, or; the
Triumph of Time, an
extremely popular work
which was ﬁrst
published in 1588 and
ran through several
editions. It was Greene,
incidentally, who on his
deathbed moddngly
called Shakespeare ‘that
up-start cow, Shakescene' .
