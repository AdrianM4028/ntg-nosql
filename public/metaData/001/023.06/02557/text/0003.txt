I am delighted that the British Coucil Division of the British High Commission is
once again co-operating with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations in
presenting one of Britain’s most exciting groups, the English Shakespeare
Company, to audiences in India. We value this co-operation highly in our work to

strengthen Indo-British cultural links.
The first performance in Delhi is being graced by the presence of His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales, who is Vice-Patron of the British Council, and by

Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales.
In recent years, British Industry, Banking and Commerce have shown an
increasing appreciation of the value of collaboration with the British Council in
demonstrating the best aspects of our culture overseas, through sponsorship
support. This year Britain is the official partner in the Indian Engineering Trade
Fair, and a number of British Companies are supporting the ESC Tour. I am
particularly grateful to British Airways, the principal sponsor, and to British Gas
and Lucas Automotive for their important contributions.
British theatre groups invariably find Indian audiences amongst the most
discriminating, knowledgeable and appreciative of any in the world, and
Shakespeare’s plays are particularly well known and loved. I am therefore
pleased that Indian audiences will have the opportunity to experience two
important, but not often performed plays, A WINTER’S TALE and
CORIOLANUS, mounted by one of the best theatre companies of recent years.
