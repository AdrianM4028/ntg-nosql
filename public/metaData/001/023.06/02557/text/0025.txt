The behaviour of individuals with
morbid jealousy can be both bizarreand
violent. It is often characterised by
“checking”. In classical cases this would
mean checking whether a wife is really
at work, checking the mileage of her car
or checking her underwear for semen
stains.
Continual
interrogation,
occasionally using torture, is a feature of
the husband’s determination to discover
the 'truth', even though that is what he
fears most. An admission of guilt by a
partner, often produced in a desperate
attempt to improve the situation, can
lead to explosive violence. Jealousy is
the principal motive for murder within
marriages, and possibly a quarter of all
murders are associated with jealousy.
The characteristic pattern is that, in
cases of morbid jealousy leading to
murder, ninety per cent of the victims
are spouses, and the majority of the
remainder are children of the marriage.
Leontes, however is somewhat different
in that he tries to murder the suspected
adulterer.

To the Elizabethans,
however, Time was not
always a beneficent

It is remarkable that Leontes appears to
make a complete recovery — even when
his queen returns to him — as morbid
jealousy is renowned for its persistence
and its resistence to all forms of
psychiatric treatment. Even if drug
therapy is initially successful, delusions

of infidelity have a tendency to return
when treatment is withdrawn — even
when the individual has moved on to a
new relationship. In such cases the only
answer would appear to be permanent
separation.

“mowing mankind
down", while pictorial
representatims
invariably depicted him
with his scythe and his
hour-glass as a grim
memento mori. A full
catalogue of the
characteristics of Time is
in Shakespeare’s own
poem, The Rape of
Lucrece, in one stanza of
which we are told that
"Time's glory" is both to
“cairn contending kings,
To unmask falseth
and bring truth to light"
and To ruinate proud
buildings with [his]
hours, And smear with
dust their glittering
golden towers”.
In The Winter's Idle,
Time is endowed with a
multiplicity of powers,
but they are not
destructiveThey are a
reﬂectim of the
multiplicity of the play.
