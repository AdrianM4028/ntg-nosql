problems facing all mankind : the lack of
foundation for a lasting peace, the
devastation of the environment and the
lack of a humane economic system in
the third world. A tall order, the success
of which obviously depends on

to satisfy the rising expectations of the
workers? Is the system capable of
reform? Can there be a third way,
between the stultifying tramp of sovietstyle socialism and the flamboyant
freebooting of capitalism?

international co-operation as much as

It took a long time for one-party
socialism to collapse. Hans Modrow, the
caretaker premier of the GDR, has said
that he had to disabuse Gorbachev in
January this year, as the soviet leader
still believed socialism could survive in
East Germany in a more dernoctratic
form. Modrow had to tell him that this
was, unfortunately, not the case. The
GDR had confirmed the experience of'
other formerly socialist countries of
Eastern Europe. The system could not
be reformed, it had to be replaced; there
was no hope of a third way or a last
chance for socialism. Pure socialism, as
a socio—econornic system, has failed in
practice. Another system is necessary.

At a time of ’superpower overstretch’,
his words have not fallen on deaf ears.
President Gorbachev has slowly
convinced the West that the Soviet
Union is no longer the evil empire but
that it wishes to live with others in a
common

’European House’.

As an

earnest of his intention, he has affirmed
that the socialist countries of Eastern
Europe must be free to solve their
problems in their own ways,
acknowledging that there may be more
than one way to reach the goal of
socialism. The Brezhnev Doctrine is no
longer party policy and there can no
longer be any question of the Soviet
Union using full military might to
impose the Moscow line, as was done
against Czechoslovakia in 1968.

This has been the experience of the
countries of Eastern Europe. They are

now partly reaching back to the
attitudes and traditions of the time
before sovietisation. At the same time,

they are feeling their way forward into a
post-industrial society. The Soviet
Union, because of its
different
evolution, is still on the brink. There

remain,

as

always,

questions

unanswered. Where does all this leave
the rest of Europe? What is to become of

the European tradition of progressive
political thought? Do we still cling to the
idea of a socialist utopia? Or do we

accept that absolutist socialism is an
idea which failed, just as the idea of
absolutist Empire has failed again and
again?

The prophet of peace and freedom
remains largely without honour in his
own country. He has had spectacular
successes in the international field, but
the problems of the Russian economy
have proved to be intractable. He hasn’t
been able to fill the shops with things to
buy, but he has allowed a symbolic
foothold for American-style capitalism
in the form of a McDonald’s hamburger
bar in Moscow itself. As a symbol for
Glasnost it also highlights his dilemma.
Conditions in parts of the Soviet Union
now bear an uncanny resemblance to
those in ancient Rome, reported
onstage by Aufidius: “The dearth is
great, The people mutinous”.
With Mikhail Gorbachev as the
guarantor of their freedom within the
system, the countries of the Eastern Bloc
have begun to address their own
problems. How can an economy with
low productivity, which is nevertheless
devastating the environment, be made

One of the lessons of Coriolanus is that it
is no use patronising the masses. Little

after

its

composition, the absolutist monarchy
in England was overthrown. One of the
main tasks facing Eastern Europe now
is of finding a balance between idealism
and pragmatism, of finding that ’third
way’ between the rigidity of absolutisrn
and the instability of a system which
wavers according to market forces.
