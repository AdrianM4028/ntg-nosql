primary evidence of a rare condition
called paranoia. Paulina, an observer of
his condition, attributes this to lunar
influences. However a modern clinical
observerwould be likely to attribute the
cause of his madness to more earthly,
though considerably more complex
matters.

Exactly ﬁfty years later
— in 1906, the year of
her stagejubilee —
Ellen Terry played the
role of Hermione for the
ﬁrst time in a lavish
productim at His
Majesty's Theatre, under

the management of Sir
Herbert Beerbohm Tree
Time, described by
Milton as “that subtle
thief of youth", plays a
praninent role in The
Winter's lble, with its
notorious sixteen-year
time lapse, bridged by
Time's appearance in the
role of Chorus
Shakespeare‘s audiences
were familiar with the
ﬁgure of FatherTime
through various verbal
and pictorial
representations and from
pageants and masques
As the Father of Truth,
Time had appeared in
the cormatim occasims
of Henry VIII, Mary and
Elizabeth — those
spectacular processims
canbining regal
splendour and theatrical
pageantry — and
Thanas Middletm used
him in the Lord Mayor's
show of 1613, The

ltiumphs of Ttuth He
was a popular ﬁgure in
allegorical masques, his

annipotenoe making
him an effective deus ex
machina to solve the
central conﬂict of the

story.

Why morbid jealousy develops in some
men but not in others is a question of
some difficulty. There are those who
appear to have a degree of justification
for extremes of jealousy — including
those who allege adultery during
divorce proceedings — but these are
rarely the cases in which extreme
reactions are recorded. The true origins
of irrational jealousy may lie in a
multiplicity of factors —— intra-personal,
situational and social. Some men may
be particularly vulnerable to the
disorder because of long-standing
personality traits (part nature, part
nurture), which make them suspicious,
rnistrustful of people in general, over
sensitive to offence and lacking in self—
esteem. The development of these
characteristics in childhood, combined

with feelings of sexual inadequacy in
the present relationship, could provide
the necessary catalyst for some
individuals.
Leontes, however, is of previously good
character, and is not reported as having
been of a naturally jealous disposition
beforehand. It may be that Leontes has
some reason to feel as he does, as
Hermione has been spending a
considerable amount of time with
l’olixenes, but this alone could not
account sufficently for the extremity of
his feelings. Perhaps she is, or else he
imagines that she is, purposefully
trying to provoke him to jealousy — in
order to gain more affection and to focus
his attentions afresh on their sexual
relationship. Freud explained delusions
of jealousy as one possible result of the
denial of latent homosexuality. A
Freudian
diagnosis of Leontes’
condition would therefore seem to
suggest that, in fact, he really desires
I’olixenes. It is unlikely that this was
Shakespeare’s view.
