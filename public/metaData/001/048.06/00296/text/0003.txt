- SCENE 2
All three return - sad.

Kalidasa did not attend the ceremony

Kalidasa feels that his real honour is in sharing with his
audience and readers.
.

Chandragupta comes with the souvenir.

Kalidasa is absorbed

in his own thoughts - angry at the very nature of creativity,

needing communication and identification.
He asks for the manuscript of 'KUMARASAMBHAVA'...
A NOTE ON THE PLAY.
KUMARASAMBHAVA by Kalidasa is on the incidents leading to
the birth of Kumara, Hindu war god, who came to this world to
destroy the forces of nescience, namely, self-centered ego
governed by likes and dislikes, wrath and illusion.
Scholars
have interesting and often differing, opinions about this epicl
There are also interesting anecdotes as to why this magnum opus
was not completed at a112 To cite only one, from Kalidasa's

authentic critic Arunagirinatha:

The poet in Canto 8, has

lingeringly dwelt on the sexual intimacies of Shiva and Parvati

which enraged Goddess Parvati.
could not complete his epic.

She cursed him.

Kalidasa just
.

There are some more views presented by scholars on the
uncompleted verse work. Mallanatha and Arunagirinatha's
commentaries are only till Canto 8. Secondly, Cantos having less

than 60 slokas are only 2 in the Raghuvamsa and only one in the
first 8 Cantos of Kumarasambhava, whereas out of the later

9 Cantos, 7 have less than 60 slokas each.

Thirdly, the diction,

style and timbre of later Cantos do not display the excellence,
"cohesiveness and integrity of the earlier 8 Cantos. The use of
similes, metaphors and meaning-based figures of speech,

in the

later Cantos is not of the usual, high level, of the earlier
8 Cantos.
Internal evidences to show that the later 9 Cantos were not

by Kalidasa:

1. Metric flaws:
2. Wrong usages:

'UPAVISTSURENDRENADISTAM SADARAMASANAM‘B
'PARITYAJADHVAM'é, MADVIGRAHAMADHI,5
SATRUVIJESYAMANAM.6

3. Fillers: Ca, hi.
Now, a word about the historical authenticity of two
,references in the play.
