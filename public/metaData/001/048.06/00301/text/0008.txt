The acting and production style endevours

remain as close to the basic ethzs of Bhivei to
as possible.
The main strength of a traditional Bhavei performance
is the displiy of the astouhding erosobetic skills

which is difficult if uOL impossible to acquire for
an actor who is not brought up es e
Bhgvai pliyern

The variety of LUSiC and dance in Bhevei has

become very limited, Instead of restricting the
selection of tunes to those that are used in Bhevei
perform nee. I have eclected 1 nueber of them from
the entire T‘DgG of Gujereti folk rusic° Dance
movements ll Shevai being closer to Kethek, some
rttempt is o1J* to bring in तो greater variety.
Use of the stage properties like the Zherokha
carried by the king in this production is in keeping
with the Bhivei style although it is not used in

the performance of the stme Vesh.
The large torches used to light up the acting
area are rarely used after the advent of petromex

lamps and elect ic lightso

However, the Bhevai

players still carry small hand torches to spotlight
their fic'el expressions at e dramatic monent.
This
production uses this device Speringly and symbolically
keeping in mind the limitations of the modern stage

and the actor‘s capacity with this skill.
This version of JnShu OMAN was first written
in Gujereti, for the Occasion of the Gujereti Sahitya
Perished held at Delh

in 1967.

very grateful

to Dr. Shyem Farmer lo; his close collaboration in
translating it into Melavi Hindi.

In this attempt to revive JnSMu ODAN, I would
like to think the National School of Drama and its
Repertory for their willing co—operetiveo
