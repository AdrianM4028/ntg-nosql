Nele Rishi, Jesme — Kemekundele, Kayak — Keldev and
Renglz ~ Leldev become extensions of eech other and

thus alter, the basic pattern of interpretation.
It the traditional version, Kemekundele is simply
the sensual temptress; here she becomes a creative artist
working in e celesticel troupe.

She sheres with Jasme

her pr;de end dignity in her vocation.

The traditionally

hypocritical Nele Rishi becomes a fearless seeker of
truth ,nd the physically 21d mentally disgusting,
foolis: husband of J4Sm3 retains the philosophic tempere—

ment cf Nola Rishi in my version.

He eqtires knewledge

and tisdom from wenderihg minstrals, sufies and sedhus,
who ever he happens to meet.

InSpite of his physical

handizep he is always preoccupied and seeks to extend
the limits~of his own familiar world. To him this pro—
cess itself is beautiful. It is this rare and unusual
quality of his persontlity that makes him the odd men
out, rather than his physical shortcoming. ﬁeldev is
portrayed es the Lord of Eime end Leldev represents the
colour ezd temper 3f the times.
