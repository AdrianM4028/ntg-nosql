parties functioning in the States could present their productions at a reasonable
cost. Besides, it was necessary to take steps for the training of teachers who
could promote creative art in the school rooms of different educational institutions.

For this purpose, the Organisation after a great deal of effort acquired a
piece of land measuring about .75 acres in Defence Colony, New Delhi.

It was

not easy to obtain this building site and to pay for it without any outside help.
An appropriate plan has been prepared and has been approved by the Delhi
Municipal Corporation. The total cost of the project will be about Rs. 20 lakhs,
including the prices of the land which has been already paid. The Ministry of
Education has agreed to grant ﬁnancial assistance upto Rs. 6 lakhs provided we
are in a position to raise another 6 lakhs as the matching amount of the Government grant through donations. The Organisation is hopeful of collecting another
sum of Rs. 1 lakh from their friends and supporters, provided a generous donor
comes forward and donates a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs to complete the project.
I would like to inform in this connection that our Organisation has been
fortunate for securing exemption from income-tax liability on the contributions
which are made to our Organisation for this project. Further, we would like to
add that the Delhi Children’s Theatre would consider it a privilege to associate
the name of our benefactor and donor, on a lasting basis, by naming the Theatre
Auditorium after the donor or any other person of his choice. We Would also be
prepared to introduce suitable changes in our ConstitutiOn to provide for two
permanent seats for the donor’s nominees on policy-making body of our Organisa-

tion, that they may directly share in the responsibility for this project in the
constructive ﬁeld of work which we have undertaken.
