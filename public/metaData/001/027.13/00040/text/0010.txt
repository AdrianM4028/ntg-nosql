Love is . eternal. It is love which can conquer everything and overcomes all
the obstacles in the world.
Sumant, the little village boy, changes the heart of the cruel king with his
love and affection.
The king is very proud of his beautiful garden, but he does not like the
children to play in it. He turns out Sumant and his little friends and builds a
wall all ' around the garden with the result that Spring disappears and the ﬂowers
and trees wither away.
The King watches the frosty winter covering his garden. He cries for
Spring to come back and realises the truth only when Sumant tells him that his
garden. will bloom once again if he showers his love and affection on the children
by letting them play in his garden.
