The Play Written

in the traditional Bhavai style, is a satire
on the corruption
in the institution of Justice. It also shows how a
person who is led into wrong
actions out of greed has to ultimately face the conse
quences of his own actions.

A man named Chhaila gets the judgement in his favou
r by giving false hopes
of providing the Kazi (the Judge) with a lot of mone
y and finally even ditches him
by not giving him any of the promised riches.
This serves the Kazi right for his
selﬁshness and greed.
