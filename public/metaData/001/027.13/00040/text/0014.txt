This is a famous story from Hindu mythology. Dhruv was the son of queen
Suniti who had earned the disfavour of King Utanpad. One
day when Dhruv
went to the court he saw his stepbrother Uttam sitting in
his father’s lap and he
was also tempted to sit there. But queen Suruchi rebuk
ed him and turned him
out of the court saying that his father’s lap was meant
for Uttam only. Dhruv’s
mother Suniti consoled him by saying that
he should try to please God who is
the father of this universe. Dhruv went to the
forest in search of God and after
deep penance he achieved ‘Nirvana’. God Vishn
u blessed him with a boon that
he will shine as a star and be the source of inspi
ration to all.
