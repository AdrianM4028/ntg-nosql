MESSAGE I-"R OM THE SPONSORS
A highlight of the Diamond [ubilee celebration at the Doon
School in October this year, was the solo performance of
"Iis Lahore Ni Vekhiya‚Äù played to a packed audience of
about a thousand students, old boys, parents and guests;
it found favour with almost all the spectators.
Subsequent to the performance, at a chance meeting, Nitin
Sukhija initiated the idea of getting the play sponsored,
and approached us for help and guidance. A spontaneous
decision was made and the project was on its way.
Having absolutely no experience in this field, we started
our research which found us on unfamiliar ground such as
hiring of a hall, seeking exemption from entertainment tax
(without success), printing of this brochure, deciding on sale
of tickets and an array of other small details. However; we
overcame most of the hurdles and are all setfor a performance
on 4th of December, 1995.

We wish to thank Mr. S.R. Das, Headmaster of the Doon
School for giving the students time off during term to make

a trip to Delhi for rehearsals and the eventual performance.

Our sincere gratitude to Mr. Arun Kapur, Headmaster of
Vasant Valley School for his help; Mr. Mark Desuza for

imparting his experience in this field to us, Mr. Dar, Headmaster
