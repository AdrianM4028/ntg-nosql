MESSSAGE FROM
THE HEADMASTER
THE DOON SCHOOL

Dramatics has been an integral part of the curriculum in a boy’s
life in the school. For this reason, almost the first project the school
took up soon after its foundation was the splendid amphitheatre,

known as the Rosebowl. No term was complete without a major
production. As years went by, Headmasters, especially Mr. Martyn
and Col. Simeon encouraged this wonderfully creative activity
and today no term is complete without 3 or 4 productions in

Hindi and English. This Diamond Jubilee Founders is no exception
and boys and masters have once again worked enthusiastically to
produce the play tonight. I am sure you will enjoy the performances

of the actors. But spare a thought also for the backroom boys.
They too have worked many arduous hours.
