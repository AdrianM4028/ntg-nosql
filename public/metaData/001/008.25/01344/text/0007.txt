‘OUR PEOPLE HAVE GONE MAD’
The Punjab, August-September ’47
It would be unique, a cataclysm without precedent, unordered in
pattern, unreasoned in savagery. For six terrible weeks like the
ravages of medieval plague, a mania for murder would be no sancturay
from its scourge, no corner free from the contagion of its virus.
Half as many Indians would lose their lives in that swift splurge
of slaughter as Americans in four years of combat in World War
II.
Everywhere the many and the strong assaulted ,the weak and the
few. In the stately homes of New Delhi’s Aurangazeb Road, the
silver souks of Old Delhi’s Chandni Chowk, the mohallas ofAmritsar,

the elegant suburbs of Lahore, the bazar of Rawalpindi, the walled
city of Peshawar, in shops, stalls, mudhuts, village alley ways, in

brick-kilns, factories and fields, in railway stations and tea houses
, communities which had lived side by side for generations fell
upon each other in an orgy of hate.
And so, in a bewilderingfrenzy, Hindus, Sikhs and Moslems turned
on each other. India was ever a land of extravagant dimensions
and the horror of the Punjab’s killings, the abundance of human
anguish and suffering they would produce, did not fail that ancient

traditioin, Europe’s peoples had slaughtered each other with bombs,
shells and the calculated horrors of the gas chamber, the people of
Punjab set out to destroy themselves with bamboos, hockey sticks,
knives, swords, hammers, bricks and clawing fingers.
