THE PLAY
The play is set against the background of the partition of India.
As a result of the partition a large number of Hindus and Sikhs
have migrated from Pakistan to India. In the city of Lahore a
’haveli’ has been abandoned by its Hindu inhabitants. An old

lady who has been left behind by her family is the sole occupant
of the house. This haoeli is then allotted _ to a Muslim migrant
fa m ily-Mirza .
At the outset this family (Sikander Mirza, his wife Hamida Begum
and their children [aved and Tanno) treat this woman with

hostility and indifference. But the old lady, along with her love
and innocence is gradually accepted by the family. This old lady
is always busy helping others in the vicinity. She is liked and
respected by all.
A local ruffian has his eyes set on the ’haveli’. He wants to
occupy the haveli in the name of religion. He. is therefore trying

to turn the people of the locality against the old lady but the
protagonist poet Nasir Kazmi and the Maulvi foil this ruﬂian’s
effort.
The old lady realized the pressure on the Mirza family and decided
to leave for Hindustan but she was stopped by the family.
When the old lady passed away, Nasir, the Mirza family, the Maulana
and the other neighbours felt that shé should be cremated in accordance
to Hindu rites.
But the fundamentalist ruffian — Pehlwan could not come to

terms with his fellow Muslims cremating a Hindu lady. That
night he along with his acomplishers murdered -the Maulvi.
It is at this tragic point that the play comes to an end.
Though the Mirza family itself did not mind staying with a Hindu
lady and cremating her when she passed away, others in the locality
could not accept this act of broad mindedness.

This play thus aims at portraying the conﬂict that was present
in the Indian and Pakistani societies with regard to religion.
