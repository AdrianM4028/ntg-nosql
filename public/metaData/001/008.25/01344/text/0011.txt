DIRECTOR "8' NOTE
In today’s grim and violent communal situation, what is needed
is perhaps an objective look at the situation and happenings around

us. The significance of the politics of communalism and ethnicity
today on the Indian subcontinent has its long historical roots.

The greatest migration is History, in words ofthe authors of Freedom
at Midnight’ encompassed in inanimate beads of metal was an
enormity of anguish and sufferings almost beyond human competence
to imagine or the human spirits’ capacity to endure.
As the political situation blurs on the sub continent, the most
fundamental question of one’s life, death and survival in this
saddening ambience, may give a feeling of helplessness.Perhaps
the ability to laugh, mourn and repent to make fun and sit up
and look at the tragic aspect of our “tryst with destiny ” minutely
is the only way to be able to relate to universal human values
and passions which are getting replaced by petty politics. Forces
that triumph are-betrayal, dishonesty, comnieraalisation, lumpenisation
and selfish ambitions.
At these cross-roads towards. the end of the century one has to

seek succour and harmonmy by racing against time and fighting
the tide, leaving aside the meaningless political positions and instead
probing the universal against mundane problems of day to day
living.
I am personally grateful to Mr. S.R. Das for having done a wonderful
job of providing of conducive enviornment for Hindi Dramatics
in the Doon School.
I would like to thank the cast and crew of the play for their hard
work at odd hours and comprehending the mood of the play and
critical situations of its performance.

I am also grateful for all the cooperation and help I have received
from Mr. Vaishnav, Dr. M.C. [oshi, Mr. G.S. Singh, Mr. Ajay

Kumar and Mr. Ashad Qazalbash.
