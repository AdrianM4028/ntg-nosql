Dramatics has been an integral part of the
curriculum in a boy’s life in the school. For this
reason, almost the first project the school took up
soon after its foundation was the splendid amphi—
theatre, known as the Rosebowl. No term was
complete without a major production. As years went
by, Headmasters, especially Mr. Martyn and Col.

Simeon encouraged this wonderfully creative activity 4
and today no term is complete without 3 or 4

productions in Hindi 8: English. This Diamond Jubilee
Founders is no exception and boys and masters have

once again worked enthusiastically to produce the
play tonight. It is being staged in our new multipur~
pose hall. I am sure you will enjoy the performances

of the actors. But spare a thought also for the
backroom boys. They too have worked many
arduous hours.
