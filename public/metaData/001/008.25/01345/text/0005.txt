‘ Director’5 Note
In today’s grim and violent communal situation, what is needed is perhaps an objective look at
the situation and happenings around’us. The significance of the politics of cornmunalism and
ethnicity today on the Indian subcontinent has its long historical roOts.
The greatest migration in History, in the words of the authors of ‘Freedom at Midnight’ encompassed in inanimate beads of metal was an enormity of anguish “and sufferings almost ’
beyond human competence to imagine or the human spirits' Capacity to endure.
As the political situation blurs on the sub continent, the most fundamental question of one’s
life, death and survival in this saddening arnbience, may give a feeling of helplessness.
Perhaps the ability to laugh, mourn and repent to make fun and sit up and look at the tragic
aspect of our “tryst With destiny" minutely is the only way to be able to relate to universal
human values and passions which are getting replaced by petty politics. Forces that triumph are —
betrayal, dishonesty, commercialisation, lumpenisation and selfish ambitions.
At these cross—roads towards the end of the century one has to seek succour and harmony
by racing against time and fighting the tide, leaving aside the meaningless political positions
and instead probing the universal against mundane problems of day to day living.
I am personally grateful to Mr. S.R.Das for having done a wonderful job of providing of conducive enviornrnent for Hindi Dramatics in the Doon School.
I would like to thank the cast and crew of the play for their hard work at odd hours and
