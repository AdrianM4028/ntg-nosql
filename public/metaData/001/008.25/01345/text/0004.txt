The play I

५

The play is set against the background of the partition of India. As a result of the partition a
large number of Hindus and Sikhs have migrated from Pakistan to India. In the city of
Lahore a ‘haveli' has been abandoned by its. Hindu inhabitants An old lady who has been
left behind by her family is the sole occupant of the house. This haveli is then allotted to a
Muslim migrant family—Mina.
At the outset this family (Sikander Mirza. his wife Hamida Begum and their children
Javed and Tanno) treat this woman with hostility and indifference. But the old lady, aldng
with her love and innocence is gradually accepted by the family. This old lady is always
busy helping others in the vicinity. She is liked and respected by all.
A local ruffian has his eyes set on the ‘haveli.’ He wants to 'occupy the haveli in the name of
religion. He is therefore trying to turn the people of the locality against the old lady but the
protagonist poet Nasir Kazmi and the Maulvi foil this ruffians effort.
The old lady realized the pressure on the Mirza family and decided to leave for Hindustan
but she was stopped by the family.
When the old lady passed away, Nasir. the Mirza family. the Maulana and the other
neighbours felt that she should be cremated in accordance to Hindu rites.
But the fundamentalist ruffian — Pehlwan could not come to terms with his fellow
Muslims cremating a Hindu lady. That night he along with his accomplishers murdered
the Maulvi.

It is at this tragic point that the play comes to an end.
Though the Mirza family itself did not mind staying with a Hindu lady and cremating
her when she passed away. others in the locality could not accept this act of broad
mindedness.

' This play thus aims at protraying the conflict that was present in the Indian and

Pakistani societies with regard to religion.
