after independence.

The leading character of the play, Radhe Shyam Sharma gives up

every thing he has to participate in freedom struggle. His sacrifice, truthfulness, honesty
and dedication could not earn him anything in life except complexes, disappointments and
helplessness. Because on his “Stubborness” and absence of avarice in him for status

post, money or power, he loses his beloved but continues his struggle,

Although he is

aware of the fact that nature has not foreordained recognition, status, power and comfort
to decide the shape of things and that under present circumstances these very things are
deciding the shape of things, he continues to struggle for his principles which have no

importance for any one except himself, He, an idealist is a helpless witness to the collusion
between politicians Er neorich which is intended to safeguard the interest of

to exploit the workers.

neorich and

This demoralizes him but he does not give up.

Krishna Kurnar an M.L.A. of the city is a diametrically opposite character, He is a
living epitome of these tendencies which are inirnical and destructive to the Society. He
has insatiable craving for power and money and he has got them.
This play is an attempt to establish those values which have lost their meaning in
present day p0llt|CS. Even a mention or these values has lost its relevance "
