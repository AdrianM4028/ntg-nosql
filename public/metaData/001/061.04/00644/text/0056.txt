Lebedev Ki Nayika

This play is a heart touching love story of Indian Lady, ’Champa' and a famous Russian

musician Lebedev of British period. The most important factor of play is that it throws
light on the fact that a Russian man established first Bangla Theatre in India in the end of
18th century after a difficult long struggle with British rulers of India. It gives a message
to Indian people that how a famous Russian man fought for Indian culture and tradition
with Britishers and in the end he gained success.

With all this, the play covers a big canvas and teaches many different factors of
Indian social life of the time as also the woman psycology and social status of women
of the time.
