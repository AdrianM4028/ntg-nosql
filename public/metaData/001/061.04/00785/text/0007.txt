I am glad to learn that the Sahitya Kala Parishad is again
organising the very popular programme of Yuva Mahotsava
from the 26th December, 1987.
The Yuva Mahotsava provides a unique opportunity of
projecting the young talents of Delhi in the field of art, music
and drama. As Delhi is slowly becoming the cultural capital
of the country also and a wealth of artistic talent, the
significance of the Yuva Mahotsava is all the more.
I send my very best wishes for the success of Yuva
Mahotsava and hope that the young talents, who would be
projected therein, would ultimately turn out to be artists of
national and international fame and would not only bring
glory to themselves and the country, but will also enrich their
respective cultural and artistic fields significantly.
