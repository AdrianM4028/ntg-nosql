3rd YUVA MAblOTSA VA. . .
The spirit of Yuva Mahotsava which came into being in the International Year of Youth in
1985, has now become an annual feature of Sahitya Kala Parishad. This Mahotsava which is
being organised for the 3rd consecutive year is providing opportunities to young talents of
Delhi in the ﬁeld of performing and fine arts.
For, this year, owing to a surge of interest and enthusiasm on the part ofyoung talents, the
Parishad was ﬂooded with about 100 applicants in Dance, nearly 80 in Music and 50 in
Drama. Out of these applicants the selection committee comprising of well-known field

authorities, selected 2] Musicians, 18 Dancers and 7 Drama Directors for presentation of
their creativity. In Fine Arts too, there were 215 applicants with their works in the medium

Hope that the trend of trying out fresh and new talents will bring pleasant changes in the
cultural scene and will go a long way in making Delhi the cultural capital of the country.
