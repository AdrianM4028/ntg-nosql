ODISSI

Parvati started learning Odissi at an
early age of six and gave her first public
recittal at the age often. She has continued
to train rigorously all these years first under
Guru Hari Krishna Behera and then under
Shrirnati Madhavi Mudgal.
Not content with just dancing, which
comes naturally to Parvati, she has also
passed the sixth year examination in Odissi
dance, thus combining an understanding of
the theory of dance while interpreting the

subtler nuances of the idiom.
Parvati is a Sahitya Kala Parishad
scholarship holder and one of the artists
selected by ICCR for ernpannelrnent for the
