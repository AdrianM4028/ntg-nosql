I am glad to know that the Sahitya Kala parishad will
be holding the 9th Yuva. Mahotsavaq a 17-day' affair, from
February, 2 this year. The fact, that the sapling, which was
planted in 1985, in the International Year of the Youth, has
assumed sturdy dimensions, is a matter of satisfaction for
all those who have been engaged in the task of its nurturing
and development.

The Festival, which has grown immensely in popularity,
witnesses a veritable surge of youth force in the creative
.fields of performing and visual arts and has come to be known
as the biggest youth event of the country.

Every year it provides a common platform to hundreds of
new young talents of different disciplines to blossom
forth into accomplished artists.

I wish the Mahotsava a grand success.
