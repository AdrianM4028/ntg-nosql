Born in 1968 into an Orthdox Syrian
Christian family, Joyce was fascinated by
rhythm and melody right from the very shart.
Her childhood involvement became a serious
reality when she joined Padmashree Leela
Samson in 1986. Under her competent and
painstakingly thorough tutelage, Joyce found
poetry in movement and ecstasy with peace
in rhythm.
A Gold Medallist in Anthropology from
the University of Delhi, Joyce is presently a
Senior Research Fellow with the University
Grants Commission. She is pursuing her Ph.
D. in the field of Exercise Physiology with
special reference to Bharatnatyarn dancers.
Along with her Guru, she has given
