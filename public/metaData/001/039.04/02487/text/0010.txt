fâ€˜Snakes are a large and successful
group. They occur on all continents except Antarctica. The long
narrow body is supported by a
very long backbone; some snakes
have more than 400 vertebrae in
the backbone.
A snake is always staring and
cannot shut its eyes because it
has no eyelids. Instead the eyes
are covered with a transparent
scale.
Snakes have no outer ears, and they seem deaf to
high pitched sounds. However, they may notice
duller sounds. For many snakes, one of the most important
sense organs is the tongue. This is poked out into the air or on
the ground so that the tip of the tongue can pick up chemicals
from the surroundings. The tongue is taken back inside the
mouth and placed into pockets in the roof of the mouth. These
pockets have a sensitive lining which detects chemical signals. A snake can follow a scent trail very efficiently - it smells
with its tongue !
When snakes do feed, the meal is nearly always large
compared with the size of the mouth. Food is always
swallowed whole. A snake has an amazingly flexible skull and
jaws. The jaws can be "walked" around the prey. Stomach
contents reported: frogs, monitor lizards, wild ducks, porcupine, langur, jackal, hogdeer, chital, sarnbar and leopard.
Instances of fruits in the stomach are apparently the food of
prey they have eaten.
Aroused to activity on sighting the prey, the python advances
often with quivering tail and lunges with open mouth. One or
two coils of the body are thrown around the prey holding it in
a vicelike grip. The prey unable to breathe, soon succumbs
and is swallowed head first. Prior to swallowing it is "smelt" all
over with the tongue. The snake is disinclined to move after a
heavy meal and if forced to move, hard parts of the prey such

as horns may tear through the body wall.
In zoos, the snake often refuses food for considerable periods

wrthout any ill effect. Such a fast can last for over two years!
