Among wolves, when the bitch leaves her
pups to go hunting, the young ones try to
follow her out of the den and down the path.
She snarls at them, lunges at them and
scares them till they run slipping and sliding
back to den. Their mother knows her pups
don't yet know how to high and assess
other creatures.
They don't know who is a predator and who
is not. But in time she will teach them, if it's
threatening and bigger than you, flee; if it's

weaker, see what you want to do; if it's sick,
leave it alone; if it has quills, poison, fangs
or razor olaws, back up and go in the other
direction; if it smells nice but is wrapped

around metal jaws, walk on by.
