The play is about the growing up prooes

world of the forest, governed by very sp ‘ ' ' '
play follows his growth from childhood to adolescence to
adulthood. His surrogate parents - the wolf family, his teachers Bha/oo and Bagheera and the wise old Kaa are the only
people of his world. Beyond this cohesive society, are the

once great, now gone to seed Sher Khan with his scavenger
sidekick, Tabaqui. Mowgliexperiences every important transition of adolescence: the breaking of rules, attraction to a

'Jungle Book', and not the one adapted by Disney.
