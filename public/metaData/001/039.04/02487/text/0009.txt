forests wrth plenty of cover. They are the largest ३
living cats and, unlike lions, are solitary hunters.
Each tiger has its own home range or territory. Those
of females (tigresses) are about 20 sq. km. in area,
while male territories range from 60 to 100 sq. km.
A rnale's territory does not overlap that of any other male,

although it includes the territories of several females. The
tiger regularly patrols the borders of its home range.
For a female tiger, owning a territory has advantages. She
gets to know the area well and discovers the beast places to
find prey. Having control over the prey in her area is important

if she has cubs to look after. Tigers work hard for their meals.
From studies it appears that only one stalk in 42 or 15 is

successful.
Current studies reveal that at the present tigers are being
killed at the rate of one a day, because of the high amount of
money their skin and other products fetch in the market.

BEARS
Brown bears are rare, with only a few small isolated

populations remaining.
Male bears are solitary animals. Each adult male has a home
range of upto 1,000 sq., km., which he defends fiercely
against other males. They often fight to the death. Females

also have territories, which they may share with a few young
daughters.
Despite their reputation for being fierce, bears rarely attack

people. When a bear does attack, it is sometimes because
with its poor eyesight, it mistakes a person for another bear.
