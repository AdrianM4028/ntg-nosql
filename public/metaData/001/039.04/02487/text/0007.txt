When one reads 'The Jungle Book', one
wonders why Rudyard Kipling chose wolves as
Mowgli's adopted parents. But if you read through
rest of the material on this page you will
understand why he selected them rather than
any other animal family, as their relationships
and ties are most similar to those of human
be i n gs .

Wolves are social animals and live in packs.
A pack has 7 to 20 members, its size depending
on the abundance of local prey. Wolves mate for
life, each pack consists of several pairs and their
young ones. A female gives birth to a litter of
between 4 and 7“ blind, helpless cubs in a den.
After about 4 weeks the cubs leave the den. They
are looked after not by their parents, but also by
"helpers" among the other members of the pack.
A strong, aggressive male leads each pack. his
mate is the dominant female, and this leading
pair breeds more often than the other pairs.
By hunting together, a wolf pack can run down
and kill animals which would be too big for a
solitary wolf.
