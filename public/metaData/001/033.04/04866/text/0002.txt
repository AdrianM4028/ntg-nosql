ABOUT TH E P LAY
We call this play an indulgence into self-criticism. The play deals

with the chaos that prevails in a theatre group when rehearsing for
a stage performance. A comedy that also delves into the lives of
the various group members - their motives for joining a theatre

group, their love lives and their petty fights. The play also takes an
amusing look into the various problems that theatre groups face
when staging a play - running from pillar to post to get police

permission and entertainment tax exemption. Some important
issues like the correct accent and pronunciation of Urdu words and
whether it matters in Delhi theatre where the cast consists of
people from all over India. The story revolves around the rehearsals
of a play that is being staged by this theatre group, and takes an

amusing look at the chaos that is created as the rehearsals
progress. We are bringing before you the tragedies that the staging

of any play unfolds. Our endeavor, however, will be rewarded only
if you laugh at us.
