by Natha Ram Sharma Gaur

Nautanki is the traditional form of total folk theatre
of U. P. and comprises dance, drama and music, all in
one
It is performed in different parts of Uttar Pradesh
with

slight variations in its style.

The well known styles are

Bhagat, Swang, Sapera and Swangeet, and the instruments

Used are Nakkara, Dholak and ‘Peti’ Harrnoniurn. One
can not just overlook the pulsating beat of Nakkara and
the catchy folk tunes of Nautanki.

For laSt few decades, Nautanki lost its appreciation
from educated society of theatre lovers as the" perform-its
started using

vulgar

episodes, gaudy

cab'arets, ‘cheapl‘y. enacted. comic

irrelevent costumes and

exaggerated

make ups and made this excellent indigenous folk form
cheap and in bad taste.

Nautanki is generally performed in'mthe open air-with
the audience seated on all sides of the performers and-it
lasts throughout the night. Originally males used to enact
the female parts as well but now women artists sing, dance

and act in most nautankis. ४ The tunes sung in the perfor-

mance are doha, chaubola, bahre tabil, chchand, lavniand
