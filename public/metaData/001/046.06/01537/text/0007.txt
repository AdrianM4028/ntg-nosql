D I RECTOR'S NOTE

2%;

Barry John.

Farce is tragedy played at a hundred miles per hour. In
"0THELLO", Desdemona loses her handkerchief. ln “KHISYANI
BILLI", Shankar Das loses his braces. Both give rise to similar
misunderstandings, undeserved jealousies and accumulating
catastrophe. Othello's mistake is the stuff of tragedy; Shilvati's mistake leads to outrageously funny events, and nobody dies.
What 13 at stake for the characters in a Feydeau farce iS “Ct
their lives bUt their reputations. Feydeau's men are SOIid,
bourgeois and middle-aged. HiS women, as he himself said,
“breathe virtue and are fOI’ThWith out Of breath ' ' . It iS the terI'Ol’ Of losing their DFECiOUS reputations WhiCh mades them
hide, ti” lies and pretend to be each other.

This is, of course, all in the context of the late nineteenth
century, and in the ‘Victorian’ mores and social conventions
of the original play and playwright. It is also the reason that
we have decided to place the Hindustani adaptation at the
beight of the British Raj in India.
The main qualification for the actors in a Feydeau farce'is to
be able to run a mile in the course of an evening. Ideally, they
should be middle7aged Olympic athletes. There is no time for
moments of introspection, or 'inner motivation. It is pointless to discuss the psychological causes of Shankar Dass im- ८
potence. The characters are driven by dedicated self-interest
and thrown wildly off-course by unprovoked accidents and
sudden panic. Disregarding the advice of Noel Coward, the
actors must remember their lines AND bump into the furniture!
