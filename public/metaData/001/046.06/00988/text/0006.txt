Nata Sankritana In Manipur ३
BY: SRI PH. DIVAKISHORE SHARMA

Nata Sangeet evolved out of ancient Manipuri tradition
and Pada Kritan of Bengal has been an indispensable Part of

iManipuri Gouraya Vaisnavism. The term ’Nata' expresses an
act of dancing, a dancer or a dramatication. In the second
half of the 15th century Shri Chaitanya fourced the complete
form of Kritan in Bengal and since then it had been widely
pOpular. The main object was to propogate the mystic relationship between Radha and Krishna on love. And when this
beautiful; concept reached the heart of Rajar shri Bhagya
Chandra in Manipur,it got a new manifestation. At the close
of the 17th century, the Meitei King got initiated to Brah-

rnanic religion and embraced Vaishnavism. The cult of Shiva
worship and the refined priciples of Vaisnav religeon got

merged and thus paved the way for evolution of Sankritan
now available in rnanipur. The type of Kritan used to be sung
during the reign of Garivniwas in the 18th century was known

as ’Bangladesh Pala' or ’Ariba Pala'. In the latter half of the
18th century King Bhagya Chandra accended the throne and

embraced. Vaishnavisrn of the sect of Naratarn Thakur originating from Lord Chaitanya. On the fourth day of installation of

the idol of Lord Krishna (now in the Govindaji's temple) and
on the all moon night of Kartik, the king offered Ras leela' as
a SankritanaMahayagna. In the first half of the 19th century
during the reign of Maharaj Gambhir Singh Dhop Pala was

introduced and was further developed during the reign of
Maharaj Nara Singh with the help of Goshwarni Kranadas
Thakur. In the middle of the 19th century with the introduc-

tion of ’Rasheswari Pala' and ’Jallakelli Pala’, Nata Sankritana
got its fullest form.
