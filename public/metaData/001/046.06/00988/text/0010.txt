Within twenty days to act in a play like SHAKUNTALA in
a completely different form, is realy a risky job. Anyhow
despite of some problems I enjoyed this study tour 8 is
very much influenced by the play Director learned many new
thoughts about theatre from him:

The music, Rythrn and the Dance elements of this form was
a rich experience for me and very benificial as I am going to
use folk forms in my state. My greatfull thanks to Mr. Ebotombi, Mr. Rattan
Repertory Theatre.

To do a play like Shakuntala within twenty days that too
in an absolute new traditional form appeared to us nearly

irnposible and ridiculous. But we the students of 3rd year
took the challenge. Mr. Ebotomb edited the script according
to his interpretation. He took the help of ancient Manipuri
form Natasankritana to interprete his idea about Kalidas's
Shakuntala. We got a good Opportunity to observe his working process and how to introduce the ancient form to the
ancient play in the modern context. His patience, nice
temperament of tackling the naughty students like us is too

interesting and his humanity impressed us very much. With
heartiest thanks to all the members of Chorus Repertory

for their

nice behaviour.
