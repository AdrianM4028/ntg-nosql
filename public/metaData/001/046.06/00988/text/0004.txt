too, these NATASANKRITANA (Shastriya) elements are, to
some extent maintained, however, not axactly as they are in
the tradition of NATASANKRITANA in Manipur.
For this production, the Hindi version of the play by Shri
Mohan Rakesh is followed but maximum liberty is taken to
make the play presentable in my creative style. And more over
as the NATASANKRITANA singing is not practicable in the

Hindi version because of its linguistic structure, the original
Sanskrit verses are used in the song sequenses in the play.
Of course there is a great fear regarding the questions of
communication under such circumstances. However it is an
experiment.
Finally, lam gratefull to Chorus Repertory Theatre for

their help in execution of costumes of the play and to Kum.
Tornbinou Devi for her great help in composing the songs of

the production in NATASANKRITANA Style and to also
NATASANKRITANA Gurus Sarbasri Angahal Singh and
Parijat Singh for their kind help in the Cholom and song part
of the Production.
