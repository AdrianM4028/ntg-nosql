Interpreting Abhigyana

S h a ku nta l a m
S ANAKHYA E B OTO M B I

The purest form of beauty is ever beyond the limits of
space, time and place.

At any place, at any time, in any

form it will be beautiful.

That is

Shakuntala.

And the

truest form of love is also ever beyond the values of beauty
and uglinessâ€”this

love,

the

love

of

Shakuntala

and

Dushyanta is exemplified by the fact that Dushyanta does

not respend when he sees that same pure form of beauty,
Shakuntala in his court. (Durvas' curse not withstanding.)
Such true form of Beauty and Love is ever existent in
Heaven, and those who preceive it on earth deserve to be
uplifted to the heavenly sublime.

Dushyanta later regains

that love and beauty in Heaven.
