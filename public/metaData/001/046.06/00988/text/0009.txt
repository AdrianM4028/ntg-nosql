We NSD 3rd year student's have really got the golden
occasion on of creating a new style of play, which has been
innovated from the ’Nata Sarkritana’ that is very much imb-

ibed in the Manipuri soil.
The play is the product of twenty days hard work. However.
this short span is not enough to learn a new art form and
consquently apply it to a production, specially that of a

highly classical play like ’Shakuntla'.
Nonetheless, our theatrical experience has been greatly
enriched. The new form which we have learned will undoubtelly be of use too us.
Working in this production has also been instrumental
towards giving us the idea of applying traditional forms of
theatre. Last but not least, we are thankfull to the Director of
the play and at the same time to the Chorus Repertory
Theatre, for having given us such a rare occasion,

In the frist hand experience of this production, I can’t help
to remark that understanding this play very deeply, probing
and critical eye, the classroom study only can't help a theatre
person but the process of production especially when you
get a master vision Director.
At the same time, the classical universality of the play is
the universlity of ethical values of humanity-their social order
and abode relationship that in the contemporary entangled
world of rnotely materialistic tendencies, the human kind is
now fighting for and that is where we stand by.
