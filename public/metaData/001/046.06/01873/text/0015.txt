Working in Mother
Courage was a different

experience for me, which will
definitely influence my future
working as a director as well as

an actor. Mr. Konrad
continuously stressed, during the
workshop and rehearsals, on
not showing your restless
indentification with the
character but to show different
attitudes through your presence
on the stage and voice
intonation. The job of the actor
is to show the social
relationships and its impact on
the behaviour of the character.

Working with

Mr. Konrad Zschiedrich has
been for me both a stimulating
and a disappointing expereince.

Mr. Konrad's ability to
communicate with the cast is

truly remarkable. So is his
understanding of the playâ€”
"Mother Courage". Though a

good teacher, his failure with
this production could perhaps
be attributed to an imperfect

knowledge of Indian conditions .
His experience of working in
England and Spain has been of
little use in this School, where,
perhaps a very high level of

excelence has yet to evolve.
As a director I went

through a new and fresh
process. His sense of analysing
energetic personality and
personal concern for actors set

I do not consider this
production of 'Mother Courage'
to be even an avarage one.
Considering that we spent two
and a half months working on

an example for me.

the script is excellent. His
