QIRECTOR'S NOTE

Brecht's and Engel's

legendary performance of
'Mother Courage and her

children has always discouraged
me to direct the play. I saw it

as student thirty six year ago,
and still it is one of my greatest
theatre experiences, one of the
most important lessons for a

whole theatre generation. It is
quite clear that we can't fulfill
with students the whole task of
the play . But it is a very good
opportunity to learn in a
workshop about threatre and

life. I think the best lessons
always keep open problems
which will move you in your
further life. We worked hard
and interrupted just our work,
showing you the results. This
performance is not more and
not less than a station on the

way.
