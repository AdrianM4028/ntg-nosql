, DIES} “1‘03! 8 NOTE:
. The present work at the National School of Drama
on an
३ invitation to do a production with the actors here9
is my
sedond experience of working with a drama groupo
Unlike
the previous work the present production is in Nevement
and Mime almost without wc;ds supported by the music on
drums and voices; Belonging to_the dance world, I
naturally
explored the possibility of movements in designing the play“
I believe that one could convey a lot through movem
ents only
and many a times do not need words0
Since the whole nature cf
doing this production is of a class~room experment9 it has
to be judged as sudho

For this production, I wished to take a down—tOMearth
theme and chose to work on Man-Eaters which is also connec
ted
with wild—life.
The story of the play has been drawn by
me through the newspaper cuttings covering the news of Man

Eater Pujari of Dogadda, Pauri Garhwal and articles on wild
life.

I also read obserVations of Jim Corbett about his

eXperience with the man eater at Rudraprayag.‘ I deeply felt
that we in Indiaare destroying nature by cutting down
the
forests and killing the wild animalsc
Profit motive is

behind all this and it is this deefmrestation which is one
of the main cause of compealing some wild animals to become

man eaters.

I started my work without any formal séript, deSign or plot
and everything emerged out of every day‘s worko
I asked
the actors to write their own dialogues and act them
in mime
anﬂ movement and netnwordsa
There are a few dialogues of the

tiger which has been written by the actor himselfo

The music

on drums; costumes
sets and light? hat: been styiiaed
according to the productionso
In all; it has been an experience to work in,a form which is experimental in the world

of theatre.
