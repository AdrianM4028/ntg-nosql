Synopsis of the Play

The frame-story of this play that was written in 1640 by the well-known trench author Pierre Corneille, consists of a father-son conflict:
it starts at the point where the father Pridament, a rather rich and preconceited man who has driven his son out of the house ten years
ago and is searching for him since, arrives at the cave of a famous magician to ask him for help.

His request is met by the magician, who by showing him rich garments ensures him that his son Clindor has experienced a great social
and economical rise. He takes the Pridarnent on an magic performance, in which ghosts looking like the son and his friends present
the last ten years of Clindor’s life. A theatre—in-the-theatre-play stars, a long, adventurous life—journey with ever again unexpected turns
and entanglements, with a big portion of love and betrayal, threat, fight, comedy and pathos, until it finally comes to the meeting of
father and son and its surprising end...
