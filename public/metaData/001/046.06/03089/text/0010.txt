RO B IN DA S

An Economics graduate from Utkal University (1973)
and a diploma holder from NSD (1976) he has been
teaching Design at NSD from 1977. His explorations
into modern theater led him into various roles - a
founder member of Hum Theater group (1976-83);
artistic director of FAMIT (forum for Assimilation

of Modern Indian Theater); Research project on Interaction Between Modern & Traditional Theater

(1984-85); actor in plays, ﬁlms & Television; designer for directors like E. Alkazi, Habib Tanvir,
Barry John,- B.V. Karanth and Fritz Benewitz; art
direction for ﬁlms and T.V.; director of about 40

plays which include Ballabhpur Ki Roopkatha
(1977), Weavers (1978), Turandot (1982), Death
ofa Salesman (1984), Dr. Faustus (1985), Ubu King
(1987), Panch Tantra (1989), The Round Heads &
Peak Heads (1989), Baki Itihas (1995).

His involvement with sketching, carricature and
painting gives a unique quality to his plays. But his

exploration of the line, texture and rhythm 01३ psychological impulses is what makes his productions
very impressive but strangely puzzling. The
kinaesthetic experience of his plays gives the audience a rich psychological disturbance and the haunting quality of his best theatrical moments is hard to
ferget and hard to explain.
