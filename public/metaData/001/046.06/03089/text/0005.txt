When we perform the classics, we know that their
deepest reality will never speak for itself. Our efforts
and our technique are to make them speak clearly
through us. I think our responsibility toward the
modern drama is to see that the reality of everyday
life will not speak for itself either. We can record it,
film it. jot it down, but we will be far from catching
its nature. We see that Shakespeare in his day found
the answer in his verse and prose structure related to
the peculiar freedom of the Elizabethan stage. This
can teach us something, and it is no coincidence that
the modern theatre is moving toward open stages and
is using surrealism of behavior in the place of verse
as a technique for cracking open surface appearances.

Eventually, we want to have actors who know with
such certainty that there is no contradiction between
the heightened and the real that they can slide e ffoitlessly between the gears of verse and prose, following the modulations of the text.
We must move the productions and the settings
away from all that played so vital a part in the postwar Stratford renaissance—away from romance, away
from fantasy, away from decoration. Then they were
necessary for shaking the ugliness and the boredom
off these well-worn texts. Now we must look beyond
an outer liveliness to an inner one. Outer splendor
can be exciting but has little relation with modern
