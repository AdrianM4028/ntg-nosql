ORPHISM
During the 6th century B.C., a new cult of DicnyUs, Which
may be ccnveniently described as 'Urphism', was disseminated with
missionary ardcur, ﬂLt tnly tn the mainland and in the islands, but

in the CClLDiBS nlsc.

Ctrinth'was the first city tn the mainland to

institute a tyranny and it was one cf the very important centres of

trade.
Orphism was carried tc Ccrinth and the west, in the wake Cf
Industry and Trade. It was an outgrcwth of the urban revcluticn.
Unphic crncepticn cf Lave, represents a principle that
involved a direct challenge to aristocratic thought;

To the

'ncbility ' Lave' was a dangerous thing, because it implied desire,

ambiticn, discontent.

The tendency of aristocratic thought was tc

divide, tt keep things apart.

To the orphics,“che was a thing tc be

revered
, because it implied the reunicn cf what had been
eundered , the reccvery cf what had been lost.
In the ccurse cf lcng histtry,crphism penetrated into all

classes cf society, influencing demtcrats_like Euripides. when the Greek
city state had passed the zenith cf its development, and mystical
religicn was drawing fresh vitality frcm the diffusicm cf idealism,

pessimism and sccial desperatitn, men'cf all classes expressed their

sense of disuniun in terms cf the deepening cleavage in scciety.
~This-mcvementdrew its initial inSpiraticn frcm the sufferings cf the r
peasantry, turned cff the land and inslaved intc industry by the urban

revcluticn.
