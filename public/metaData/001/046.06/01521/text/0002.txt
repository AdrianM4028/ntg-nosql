Lear

is

Fool

with

Fool,

Blind

with

Blind

and

is

Dead

with

Death. He is 'Nothing' with Cordelia '5 'Nothing'. who is sailino
in her own 'philOSphy of love and to be silent. The going awav
of Cordelia seems to be like some frozen gesture.
The play

has

not

been

a

venture

in

Direction or

in Acting,

but has simply been an exercise to share the discussions, view
points, ideas,
images, various dimensions of the play and
explore 'King Lear' with all its spatial possibilities.
Three different scripts.
including one adaptation and two
versions were read, with discussions on characters, analgsis of
text and roles alongwith a detailed look on the notes of world
Drama classes being a part of it. Watching paintings. slides and
'King Lear' by Peter Brooke and the BBC production was also
included

in the process.

The entire process of
makino
Learâ€˜
has
been painful,
complexed and exhausting. There has also been a sense of guilt,
as I have not been able to work individually much on the detail
as

I I desired

to.

Since

the

participation

includes

from

all

the

three classes, and some of the maior roles have been imparted
upon the first years too dealing with them on different levels
was also quite an experience. Needless to mentioin, working with
thirty peoiple has rather been a social excercise for me so as
to present

the play.

The main visual interpretational metaphor which sums up the
meaning of

the play

this edition of

for

me

is

lear's confession to Cordelia,

in

Lear.
