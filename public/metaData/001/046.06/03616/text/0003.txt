SAHEB BIBI GOLAM : A HOUSE OF CARDS
The novel Saheb Bibi Golam began to be serialized in the
popular Bengali weekly Desk in the early l950s. Ever since its
publication as a book, Bimal Mitra ’s novel has been assured a
permanent place in the history of the modern Bengali novel. It has
been translated into several Indian languages and has been made into
at least two popularfilms, thus presenting it before a larger audience,
almost immortalizing it.
Saheb Bibi Golam (Lords, Ladies and commoners … the names of
three sets ofplaying- cards representing three types of characters
represented in the novel) is a historical novel in the wide sense ofthe
term. It is set in Calcutta ofthe nineteenth century; the choice ofthe
place as well as the time is both daring and remarkable. The city itself
becomes a living space in the narrative in and around which march an
unending procession of characters representing various professions

of urban life along with the old occupations associated with the
lingeringfeudal structure. Among these characters are the sahebs, the
aristocrats, their unfortunate wives (the bibis) and their employees,
the gulams. The metaphor of the playing cards appears to be most
appropriate, indicating as it does, the ﬂuctuating fortunes of
individuals, as much as the stablepower — relations in human society.

The magniﬁcent, huge mansion of an old feudal family — the
Chowdhurys, is a microcosm ofsociety. The mansion not only houses
aristocratic splendours, machismo and excesses, but also forbidden
spaces like the zanana. All ofthese we discover along with skeletons
of the past through the overseenfgulam Bhootnath s journey. Mitra
narrates the story ofthefall ofthe Chowdhry household, the decay of
thefeudal order; and also the rise ofa new society— though that story
has not and may never befully told.
