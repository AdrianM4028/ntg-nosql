NOTES ON MUSIC SELECTION
Traditionally the forms of music favoured in the late 19m, early
20th century Calcutta, were Dhrupad and Thumri. The most
commonly heard styles of Dhrupad were Darbhanga, Betia and
Bishnupur One also hears accounts ofthumri singers like Maujudeen
Khan, A ngurbala, Jaddan Bai and others.
Bhramo sangeet, a form of devotional music developed around
this time, musically reﬂects a blend ofseveral styles, notably dhrupad,
tappa andfolk traditions. One also sees in this music the introduction
of choral singing and a western sensibility towards composition,
opening out a spacefor what we now know as Rabindra Sangeet.
The growth of Calcutta as a large urban centre and the
simultaneous impoverishment of the hinterland resulted in large—
scale migrations ofrural populations into the city (Bhutnath, Bansi,
Chinta and many ofthe other servants in the text are an example ofthis
movement). These migrants brought with them their musical
traditions, whichfed into the soundscape ofthe time.

Our sound trackfor the play attempts to reﬂect these historical
trends and musical styles. In addition we have resourced other
contemporary materials, which seemed appropriate to the mood of
particular scenes or characters.
