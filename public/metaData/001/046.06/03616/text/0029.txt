“ Thusfrom the midday halt of Charnock
Moves the pity
Grew a cityAs thefungus sprouts chaotic from its bed
So it spread
Chance-directed, chance-erected, laid and built
On the silt
Palace, pyre, hovel, poverty andpride
Side by side...
And above the packed andpestilential towns
Death looked down ”

Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936)
