myself.
Everything alters and is for its own time only.
This is where Brecht's difference lies with the older
convention in which material was approached from a limited
point of view—things as they are. With Brecht things will be
diﬁerent. It is a positive futuristc view. ‘Dialectics' and
‘contradictions’ are not catch-phrases, but the very basis
of his ideology. In fact, he is one of the most complex of
writers, though a superficial approach may make him seem
so simple.

But Brecht never forgot that theatre must give pleasure,
must entertain. He was not a pulpit preacher. Pleasure
and instruction must go together.
All the existing elements of his form which have become
familiar to us now—the episodic structure, breaks with
songs, projection of titles, direct address to the audience,
the narrativestyle, austere staging were not only to counter

the seporific effect of the illusionist stage but to further
the content of his plays. Of performance he said—~“it should

not be a circular performance in which everything is
completed, in which heroes and villians are balanced, it
should rather be a spiral performance, a tilted circle rising

to another horizon, and a spectator who is thrown out of
balance."

The pleasures of thought should be experienced not only
by the playwright and actor, but the Spectator tco.
