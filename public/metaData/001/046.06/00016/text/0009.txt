Note on Brecht
Though Brecht wrote and staged his plays in Germany

before his exile in 1933, then produced his best works in
the dark times living in different countries, ﬁnally returned
to East Berlin to establish the Berliner Ensemble in 1949, it
is only since the early ﬁfties that this great controversial
ﬁgure started getting to be known internationally. Since
his death twenty-six years ago, so much has been written
on him in the West, both for andragainst, that one wonders
sometimes if he is not being relegated rather dangerously,
to the library shelves as a classic ! He has been misrepresented rejected, distorted. His sense of humour, irony, his
novel form and style of presentation as against the conventions of the Western theatre of the time toxed many into not
taking him seriously consequently at times subtracting his
ideology from his work.
