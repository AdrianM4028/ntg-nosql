A Dialogue about Acting with Brecht
The actors always score great successes in your plays.

Are you yourself satisﬁed with them ?
No .

Because they act badly ?
No. Because they act wrong,

How ought they to act them ?
For an audience of the scientific age.
What does that mean ?
Demonstrating their knowledge.
Knowledge of what ?
Of human relations, of

human

behaviour, of

human

capacities.

All right ! that's what they need to know. But how are
they to demonstrate it?
Consciously, suggestively, descriptively.

How do they do it at present ?
By means of hypnosis. They go into a trance and take
the audience with them.
That sounds almost like an erotic process. What ought

it to be like then ? Witty.
Ceremonious. Ritual. Spectator and actor ought not to
approach one another but to move apart. Each ought
to move away from himself. Otherwise the element of
terror necessary to all recognition is lacking.
The Epic theatre uses the simplest possible groupings, such as express the events overall sense. No
more ‘casual’ ८ ‘life-like’ ‘unforced’ grouping; the
stage no longer reﬂects the ‘natural’ disorder of things.
The opposite of natural disorder is aimed at: natural
order. This order is determined from a social-historical
point of view.
