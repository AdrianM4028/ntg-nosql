Director’s Note
Vibhu Kumar’s APARIBHASHIT is a simple play,
simply done. One might feel that the play does not touch
upon anything important or impellent and get exasperated
yet I do not agree that the play needs any explanation or
clariﬁcation. As for those patrons who might depart before
the final scene, I offer this bit of tentative solace : that these

theatregoers may be a little domesticated in their theatrical
tastes. I just want you to bear with it and feel with it.

The script carries a play within a play, where out of
satire and sheer playfulness a fraud is laid bare, unmasking

the shallow sloganism and idiocy based on a mish mash of
half truths shrouded in dogmatism and propaganda about
the common man.

Amidst the noisy quarrels, broils, con—

flicts and jealousies, common man is thrown in the frazil.

Every statement of a National Leader, the press, and even
Theatre has so much of concern about common man yet h e
remains a myth and mystery-nothing more, nothing less

There is also a sense and smell of personal rivalries,
egoes, frustrations and selﬁsh manipulations in Theatre presented through ACTOR, DIRECTOR AND \VRITER
trio. It is bare, hard hitting yet funny in dog-eat-dog-kind
of arrangement. The production is bare-devoid of colour.
grace and levitation-not offering any moral values like in
the tragic tradition. You can just view them clearly or
participate, within the limits of your sensibility-sitting in the

dusty shell of the auditorium where we are gathered together ﬂooded with an almost liquid warmth of unchecked
human consciousness.
