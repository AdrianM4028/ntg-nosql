O

Greetings and felicitations to DARPAN for having eminently
successfully completed 25 glorious years of unparalleled service to the
cause of dramatic arts in Northern India.
As theater-goers and drama enthusiasts we were drawn to~
wards DARPAN through its soul~stirring and socially~poignant produc~
tions, crafted with meticulous care for

allround excellence. Our asso~

ciation with DARPAN started at a point of time when committed
theater activity was rather at an all tirne~low. But, to our most
pleasant surprize and satisfaction there never was even a semblance of
compromise on qualin and content in its creative efforts by the group
it is all the more apt, therefore, that the silver jubilee celebra~
tions of DARPAN begin with a veritable feast of plays for the knowledgeable audiences of Kanpur, and end on a serious exploratory note set
by the discussion on “Theatre for let Century”.

We hope that the Silver Jubilee celebrations will add new
dimensions to the already great stature of DARPAN.
