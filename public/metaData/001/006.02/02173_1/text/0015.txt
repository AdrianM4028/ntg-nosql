Its gives me a great pleasure to know that Darpan, Kanpur
has completed twenty five purposeful years of Dramatic activities.
I had long association with this organisation and have worked with
them when l was in Delhi.

There are very few Organisation

in the country who can

match the quality and capacity of Darpan, I am confident

that

this organisation shall become more stronger in years to come and
will celebrate its Golden Jubilee.
