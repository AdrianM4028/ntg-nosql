lam happy that DARPAN a very active Dramatic Group of
Northern India celebrating Silver Jubilee. I had the previlege of
witnessing their productions at Bombay few years back. Their perfor~
mance was of a very high order and quality. This itself is a proof of their
continious work in theatre. This is the prOper occasion for them and
those who are involved in this activity to be happy and proud off.
I wish them every success
