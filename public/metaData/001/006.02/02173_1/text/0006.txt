My Dear, Dr. Satya Murty,

This institution under your stewardship has rendered
selﬂess service to the cause of performing arts and indeed
there are very few such institutions which can claim this

distinction. I would however like to convey all my good
wishes for the success of the festival.
Kind regards,

Yours sincerely,

7Q . K .
