DIRECTOR'S NOTE
_
The Director’s note is a convention. Out of sheer habit we all
adhere to it. Director’s note only
succeeds in obfuscating issues.
Nevertheless. For me 'the play is
the thing.’ The play comes to life
through the actors. The implicit
design should evolve. An imposed
design is invariably a procrustean
bed. People are free to choose their
bed. I prefer spaciousness and a
sense of freedom to the cramped,
uncomfortable beds which designers provide. But I accept the given
cramped conditions of a performance place so the sense of freedom
is an illusion which is created for
the audience. If the illusion doesn’t
succeed we have failed.
Please judge the actors and the
production harshly. Do apply the
highest standards in judging them.
The second year students of this
production have more advantages
than any amateur or professional
production has in this poor country. What they don’t have amongst
them is a ’star’ But the whole point
is that they should compensate for
the lack of star qualities by their
talents, discipline, and hard work.
