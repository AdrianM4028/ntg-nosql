derives its meaning with reference to an imaginary circle which frames the extremities of the human body.
The basic idea of a kinetical build—up in theatre, whiCh we have learned from. the Kalari Gturu, is the
‘Sarirabhava' or the expression of the body. This is the exact term which the theatre can safely use to fix the pomt
at which the training of the actor starts. The two components of this term contain the whole concept of the actor’s
culture in theatre; the culture of the body and the mind; equal toi’angika’ and ’satvika’ in Indian
aesthetics and ’yu’
and ’tai’ in the Japanese concept. Like the passage of human power from its dormant state
of a coiled serpent; at

the lowest point in the vertibral column, through different regions or technically calle
d ’tatvas’, those of earth, water,
ﬁre. air, etc. reaching its destination of perfection, the actor’s expr
ession also has a procedural structure. it is a process
from the abstract to the concrete. As in the tantri k practice,
when the energy emanates from the lowest store house,
it has no speciﬁc quality. It is the ’pranava’ in the stage of
’para’, the absolute, which passes on to ’pasyanti’ (that
which beco

mes visible) and then to ’madhyama', the point of em
otion and ﬁnally to ’vaikhari’ the concrete sound.
