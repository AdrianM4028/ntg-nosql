Synopsis

The day Akito Moru and his slave Sekhose
escaped from the place of their exile and
returned to that Village, a terrifying earthquake
occurred. The unending tremor caused by the
earthquake made the numerous heads hanging

(the first stage of the three-stage ritual ofheadtaking) set up Akito saw Zubeni who had
come to give her offerings at her husband’s
grave, all hatred seen to disperse from his heart.
The moments following their meeting were

on the branches of the Magutung (the head
tree) fell on the ground and even shook down
the rocks of the Sikas—Tso (stone platform built
over the clan grave) too. The ominous crows
shrieked lingering in their flight above this
gruescorne scene. The inhabitants of the village

the most unexpected, yet the most inevitable.
Zubeni, now rnesrnerised by the tender words

were horrified for the Terhoma (the spirits)
were angry with them. They timidly asked
Grandpa Thevo (religious leader) what might
be the cause of the Terhomas wrath. Thevo

explained, — Zubeni has failed to offer Yupan
(simple offering consisting
of food, wine, clothes, etc.)
at the grave of her husband
Zuba. That has offended
Zuba’s spirit and t h e
outcome — a curse on the
innocent villagers.

Zubeni, the frightened
widow went
to
her
h usband’s g r a v e w i t h

Grandpa Thevo to give the
offering. But Adaho, her
brother-in—law, was not very

pleased with just a mere
offering of Yupan. He
requested Grandpa Thevo
to find out from his
brother’s spirit what his real
need was. A possessed
Grandpa cried in his trance,

“Human head”. Hearing
this,

Adaho

performing

after

Agjucho

of Akito, invited him to visit her the next day.

But on that fateful day, when Akito came to
her house, she come to realise that her
charming guest was none other than Akito
Moru, her husband’s killer.
