talking with Baby. She informed him about

Director’s note:
Kh. Somorendro,

Amidst the people with the individualistic
ideals who never consider the value of life,
some orphans and destitute children are
trying to trace their identity. Those who
were born and left on the dustbin of the
market of the big cities, their life ends
without any destiny. Our society have never
ready to accept them as a member of the
society. The play emphasized the dark
morals of the respected people ofour society.
