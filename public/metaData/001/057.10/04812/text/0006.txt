The festival called “Swarn Rang Pratibha” is dedicated to the Golden
Jubilee of the Akademi, which includes celebrations by way of
festivals, seminars of music, dance and drama in different states.

The ﬁrst of the series was held in Sivasagar, Assam in collaboration
with the Directorate of Cultural Affairs, Government of Assam from

6-11 January 2004.
The festival features plays of nine young directors of the State of
Manipur chosen by a committee of experts from the state. Apart
from the stage performance there will be interaction with theatre
experts and observers who are invited both from within the state
as also from other parts of the country. It is hoped that this will
give the young directors an opportunity to grow further and take
their works of art beyond the boundaries of the state.
This has been made possible with the active support and cooperation of the Chorus Repertory Theatre, Imphal and Manipur
State Kala Akademi, Imphal who agreed to take care of the entire
local arrangements. The Akademi thankfully acknowledges their

contribution as also of theatre experts and individuals from the
state who gladly offered their services.
We do hope that the theatre artistes and enthusiasts of Manipur
would not only welcome the event but also participate actively
and avail the opportunity to contribute towards further
development of theatre in their region.
