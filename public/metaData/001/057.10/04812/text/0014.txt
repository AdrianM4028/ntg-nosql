Setting various mores and beliefs of
the ethnos of the North—East region
as the cultural backdrop, the play
speaks about the monStrous shadows

of the various forces that shape
human history with the stories of
blood and vengeance — as a symbolic
representation of the deep pessimism
of modern man which defies or,
negates to test truths, thus creating
a chain of nightmarish experiences.
The creative energy of the
presentation is in spirited both by
the simplistic and lyrical contents of
folk drama and the stylistic
techniques and devices of the
alternative theatre to give a balance
between philosophical and artistic
premises.
In fact, the play is an antidote for
the corrupt and anti humanist ideas
that prevails in our society through
it’s realist outlook on life in it’s
entirety.
