I am very glad to learn that Festival of Young Theatre Directors of

Manipur is being organised by Sangeet Natak Akaderni, New Delhi in
collaboration with Manipur State Kala Akademi and Chorus Repertory
Theatre, Irnphal from 19th January 2004 at “The Shrine” Playhouse, Kangchup

Road, Irnphal. This festival will not only upliﬁ the young Directors ofManipur
but also can act as an invaluable and effective weapon to ﬁght against the

wide spread problems of social unrest in our Society.

I hope the sincere attempt ofthe organisations in organising the festival
with the publication of a Souvenir a grand success.
