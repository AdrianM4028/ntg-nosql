with Alaknand Samrath, a London trained and

As a I’laywir'ht and director his ﬁrst script ‘Kumgi

competition in Manipur. His second play
(written ८3८ directed by him for Kalakshetra)

Makokto I’okkhaikhi/ Kashudito Pashan.

Shri Tomba had received Best Playwright
Award ] .994 by Theatre Centre Manipur for
his play 'Kumgi Nong'; Sanskriti Award 2000
for his multifaceted talent as honoured by
Sanskriti Pratisthan, New Delhi.

Shri Tomba has taught physical and vocal
exercises to the actors ofSambhav, New Delhi

and third year students ofNational School of
Drama, New Delhi in l 986 and demonstrated
his exercises before an international audience at

Tokyo, Toga and Nigata in Japan in 1 987. He
had also been worked with the actors of ‘ Ran

gay ana’ of B .V. Karanth at Mysore in 1998
and independently works with young actors
from Asia at Singapore for a month in 1 998.

I was heavily impressed by the
Bengali film K‘lﬂtdil‘O Pals/21m that
I saw in 1960. Some shots of it

theatre performed to create a total
experience of all the elements of

go on haunting me still. No

making music and so on contributing

definitive answer yet. Then,
opportunity of going through
Smt. M. K. Binodini’s radio play
of [Cc/Judito Pas/um led me to read
the original story. A new light
began to down upon me. In the
meantime, Theatre Mirror’s

to a total performance. It is further to
see how a text is performed in this

production of IG/audito Pas/7472
gave me some clues to go further.
After series of reading of the radio
play and the original story with
actors of our group I had taken
up the job of scripting a play
within the images of IG/Judito
Pas/7472. Availed myself of the
opportunity of inserting M.K.

Binodini’s dialogues where they
seemed to s u i t with her
permission. Again, in the process

of reinterpretation the story, I
have used frontal dialogues and
formed living verbal as well as
visual images. My search for the

theatre setting, costuming, lighting,

process, and how naturalistic and non-

naturalistic actions are merged into a
single vital force.

I am deeply rooted in
Kalakshetra’s tradition of
elernentally non- verbal theatre.
Taking all the necessary elements
with me I have not stopped
searching a new path in my
earlier directions. Now I keep
open my heart when I am
entrusted to direct KJ/audz'to
