juﬁus Caesar
Direction: Kh. Ratankumar
Panthoibi Natya Mandir, lmphal

Synopsis
The play is in the Manipuri version ofWilliam
Shakespeare 5 “Julius Caesar” in an unabridged
form. Roman conspirators led by Marcus
Brutus under instigation of Cassius led to
assassination of Julius Caesar. This led to civil
riots and revolts against the conspirators
creating anarchism. Ultimately Brutus and his
party got a great defeat while Mark Antony
and his party got the power in Rome.
It was Brutus, the patriot, projected by the
conspirators but it was he doomed at the hands
of the conspirators. Here ends the play as
William Shakespeare depicts.

Director '5 note:

An invisible dernarcating line between a

patriot and a pseudo patriot seems to have
been haunting. The shield of both the two
against public Criticism is restoration of peace
and liberty. This play is taken up as a touchstone
for the test of a true patriot in this era of justice,
equality and liberty, facing the challenge with
my sincerity in creating the play.
The play attempts with a new production style
in indigenous and reoriented Manipuri props,
infusing folk songs, tribal songs, Manipuri
martial art, stylised movements, enriching the

performance.

It is an opportunity for me to work with my
elder directors who rolled the characters and also
with young and quite new actors of the Mandir'.
