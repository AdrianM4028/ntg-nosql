The Play
The play is in Gibberish â€” words that have no meaning. It is a creative
decision of the director.
A fine morning full of vitality, gaysome, inspired folks celebrate the ritual.
The crops depend on the perfection of ritual. They engage in the ritual with
passion.

It is time for harvest feast. Folk also resurrected. Rites performed and

dedicated to God of crops. Marriage ceremony. It is the leisure. Mother
weeps on departure of daughter. Daughter goes to in-laws, raped by
husband. Bundles of crops are given to the in-laws by the daughter. She is
our goddess . . . We rape her, as well as worship her. Despite everything,
she does not refuse us, gives huge crops. Harvest feast is due to these crops.
No faith in single eating. Everybody among village society is invited. Feast,
dance, music, celebration.
An unknown, unseen faceless man comes. Everyone hides under mask.

Faceless man wants food. Well fed by the hospitable folks. Now he wants
to dance with all. Dance begins, soon, he realizes that he cannot go in

harmony with the rest. Then he wants a mask from the villagers. They give
him a mask of different sort. He does not like it and wants a mask like others.
Folks give him, as he demands. Now he easily mingles with all. He presents
new clothes. All amused. Faceless kidnaps a fellow in the meantime. The
daughter comes passionate with new clothes. The rest are in hunger, as the
faceless ate everything. She dreams that millions of hands in search of food.
