Rang Sangam

Rang Sangam is a festival of six plays of contemporary theatre
produced by some of our well-known directors in different
languages. It represents a confluence of creative ideas, methods,

techniques and practices constantly evolving in the field of
theatre in different parts of the country. The six directors chosen to

participate bring an eclectic mix of forms, styles, and approaches;
together they offer a small, but none the less, significant view of

the best of theatre made by today’s generation. They represent
both youth and experience, but they have all made a mark in the
field and earned fame beyond their regions. One of them, namely
Balwant Thal<ur, has also been honoured with the Al<ademi Award.

The Sangeet Natal< Al<ademi offers the Rang Sangam to
the theatre lover of Orissa with the hope that he will savour its

taste in the best tradition of a rang—rasika. The land of Orissa so
wonderfully rich in dance, drama and music would surely serve an
ideal rang-kshetra for the performers.
The Orissa Sangeet Natal< Al<ademi deserves our thanks for
hosting the Rang Sangam in Bhubaneswar.
