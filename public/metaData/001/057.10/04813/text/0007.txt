The Play
Jatra — The Journey: Rabiya is a divorced woman. She earns her living by
selling firewood. Her sister Sakitan’s daughter, Dulali helps Rabiya in her
work. A woman who is socially divorced is not fit to live in the society, and
so, Sakitan scolds Rabiya and also forcefully takes away Dulali from that
place.
Rabiya recollects her past when she lived happily with her husband,
Hannan. On a special occasion Hannan had invited the Moulabi and some
other persons fora Milad at his home. On that occasion Hannan prepared
the meat for the Milad by killing Rabiya's pet duck. The women were busy
in cooking while the male members were listening to the Moulabi, who was
giving sermons on Allah. During the discussion, Moulabi made a reference
to beautiful fairies. At that moment, Hannan saw a beautiful girl at work, and
got attracted towards her. Rabiya's casual talk with the Moulabi became a
big reason for Hannan to beat her up in the presence of all guests. Later, he
also sexually assaulted her throughout the night. The next morning, Hannan
divorced Rabiya for no reason and also gave her 2 l rupees, an amount
that was fixed at the time of their marriage.
Soon, Hannan married the beautiful girl who was of his daughter’s age
and took her to his home.
After this, started the solitary life of Rabiya. She continued to live there
by force of her will power and by selling firewood. Dulali also helped Rabiya
openly in facing the crisis of her life.
On the other hand, Hannan could not satisfy his new wife and became

worn out physically and mentally. The young wife left Hannan and ran away
