"In the field of dance, the great variety of Indian styles has attracted the
notice of all students of arts and culture . . . What is most remarkable is the

continuity of the traditions and the vigour they display to this day . . .
I’ln the field of theory of drama, Indian achievements are perhaps still
more remarkable and serve as models even to this day . . .
ll

. in the field of music . . . The co-operatian of Hindus and Muslims

for almost a thousand years has . . . brought about a consummation that has

perhaps no equal in the world . . .

"This precious heritage of dance, drama and music is one which we
must cherish and develop.’I
