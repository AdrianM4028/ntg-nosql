Character, Humanity and Dignity of Labour are the
codes for Peace, Happiness and Universal Brotherhood.
Community singing and dancing are the essence of better
living.

Providence turns sympathetic to the problems of
Earth. HE has stopped granting direct salvation to newcomers to Heaven. All freshers are sent back to Earth
to lift at least one family from Below to Above the
poverty-line.

Back on Earth the Swarga-Dwari identifies what
the poverty-line is, as well as the family to be raised
above it. HE waits to find out an occasion to pass on the
aid to the worthy man and then happens events on which
HE has no control.

There is a famine of

humour in

the kingdom. The
only princess never laughs. The king is worried. He makes
a declaration. Any young man irrespective of caste, creed,

academic background or economic status can marry the
princess if he can bring smile on her face. The outcome of
this pledge changes the situation.

Food, shelter, clothes, job and dowry becomes the
responsibilities of the throne.
