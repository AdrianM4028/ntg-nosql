HIRAHANSA SU'ANGA'S presentation
Hirahansa Suanga has been designed to be produced
in any suitable space and conditions, mainly based on

the principles of indigenous traditional Jatra style (see
illustration). This corresponds to the Caturasra play-house
described in the Natya Sastra of Bharat Muni, with the

acting area in the centre with spectators on all sides.
