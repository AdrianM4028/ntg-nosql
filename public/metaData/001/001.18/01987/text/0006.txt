NATIONAL

THEATRE (MULTI PURPOSE)

A clearance of about 6 feet is required around the
central stage (24- x 24") . No settings, no stage properties

(except two wooden boxes) are needed. No light
technique (except a fully illuminated stage and passage)
is needed. Even no microphones are needed if the space
is acoustically sound. The artists passage should be

6‘ wide and of the same height of stage.
In absence of a built-in Jatra auditorium, Hirahansa
Suanga can also be improvised to be produced in western
type of proscenium theatre halls.
