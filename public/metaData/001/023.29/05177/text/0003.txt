Ines declares that it is neither by chance nor by
tnistake

and sxe

tries

to persuade the two others to confess

their faults, as the only way to understand their meeting in
hell.
She throws the blame on their bad faith and when Garcin
attomps to strike her, she suddenly understand "Each one of us
is an eXecutioner for the two others".
Garcin tries to keep to himself and to remain
silent, while Ines is busy using her charm upon Estelle who
would prefer Garcin's addresses.
Ines feels defeated and
renews

their confrontation.

Each of them will have to

confess

the faults committed during their lives दु the three of then
were responsible for the deaths of those they had loved.
Besides, Garcin is a coward.
Ines refuses the soothing effect
of mutual compassion as suggested by Garein, but she is ready
to accept an agreement if Estelle would stop resisting her.
Estelle takes refuge in Garcin’s arms, hoping to find some
consolation as the memories of her earthly existence are
threatened with oblivion and contempt.
In eXChenge she would
bring himback to the conviction of having behaved wiUi
courage, instead of rinning away and betraying a cause.
But
Ines shows an unrelenting lucidity and she does not allow
Garcin and Estelle to come together.
Garcin is full of dingSt for his own cowardice and
also for the two women and he begs to be annihilated by
physical sufferings.
The door opens and he walks back,
alleging that Ines should not be allowed to triumph.
He
decides to'stay and.try to ccnyince her.
But she reminds
him

that we are what our actions

are and_that cowardice is’

the final score of his life.
Estelle defies Ines and
entices Garcin.
But all in vain, for love is impossible in
presence of Ines whose eyes reproach him.
After a stupid
attempt to murder Ines. at last, Estelle must admit her
own defeat.
We hear an awful roar of laughter and the three
of them are forever joined in mutual mcral torture.
"Hell is other ".
