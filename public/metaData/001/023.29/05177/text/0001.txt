JEAN-PAUL SARTRE AND HUIS-CLOS

This play by Jean—Paul Sartre was performed for the
first time in

1944 before a Parisian audience.

It belongs to

Sartre's last philOSOphical phase, just before his involvement
in action.
War and resistance certainly had a decisive influence
on this evolution, which already shows in "Huis—clos", in Which

he takes up such themes as pacifism or how we are accountable for
one's own ideas, our responsibility towards others, the corrupting

"Huis—Clos” cannot be separated from Sartre's monumental
work,'"Being and Nothingness", which was published in 1943.

seems to

be

a dramatic

exercise written

in

the margin

of

Being and Nothingness, giving the philosOpher an opportunity to ५
question not only the mysteryof our human condition, but also

our relationships with, what he calls" the others" ; "the others"

title of

"Huis—Clos".

Sartre was 31 in

1936.

After passing "the agregation"

in philOSOphy, he joined the teaching profession. The influence
of the gennan philos0pher Husserl over Sartre was considerable.
In his first writings, Young Sartre described the functioning of
consciousness,

its perception of

the world,

trying

to

graSp how

human consciousness apprehends the outer world, how it reaches
towards it, how it grants it existence.

novels,

While writing simultaneously philosophical books and
Sartre clearly showed how the creativeness of a novelist

can be in contradiction with the perception of the world हैं that
is what he calls "the metaphysics" of the novelist.
Sartre the philOSOpher was brought back into the
collectiVity by the war इ Sartre the individualist had to
join his brothers in anns and to choose his side ड़ Sartre the
idealist was forced to face reality, and especially death.
Miile he was still working on his masterly book, "Being and

Nothingness,” he was also writing the four volume "Les Chemins
de la Liberté", in which he described both his own painful
coming of age and the collective cowardice of nations.
