Synopsis
in this cruel world the only ray of hope was her grand daughter Ladli who was
equally fed up of her brothers who snatched her food and after troubled her. In this
play we see the roller coaster of emotions. The characters are not larger than life.
There are many shades of grey in their personalities. The love of Ladli and of Rupa the daughter-in-law are the high points of the story.
Ladies and gentlemen we provide a glimpse into the life of Buddi Kaki.
'Buddhi Kaki' written by Munshi Prernchand is a saga of suffering. It depicts the
plight of old people in the society. Deprived of their wealth, dignity and honour they
lead a miserable life amidst us.

Like vultures, greedy relatives surrounded he for her wealth. Her nephew
Buddhiram promised her the moon and got himself nominated as the heir.
