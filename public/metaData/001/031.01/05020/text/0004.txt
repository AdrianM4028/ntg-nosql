Synopsis
Anu, Manu (or Arun, Varun), their room and their parents' lack of time for them.
Who can they talk with—with their friends or with you? Or should they remain content
by themselves and let everything go on as it would...

...because now they are in XII and X—their board years—and they must get
good percentages.

Director's note
It is not that all children find themselves in such a situation, but somehow or the
other, this theme—parents' lack of time—is around them. It is enough for children if we
provide them with a good school, good clothes, good tuition, good everything? Isn't it
equally important for parents to get down to their children's level, listen to and understand
them, and get to know how and where they spend their time? I felt the need to write this
play after being with children and listening to their experiences. When one listens
carefully to children. one can usually understand that parents either consider them too
young—and so look after them more than they need—or completely the opposite. For

this play, I preferred to explore the second situation so that we can see how children
behave behind their parents' backs, and know the questions they live amidst. Maybe

after watching the play, every parent says that s/he is not like that with their children. is
it enough to merely say that? Because just as you think you know your children the

best, your children too know you the best...
