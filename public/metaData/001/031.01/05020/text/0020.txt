Synopsis
Few kids are waiting for the moon to come, they are expecting that he will narrate
a absolutely new story to them but the moon vanishes without narrating story. Then the
folk artists come, they tell them that they will narrate & enact a good story for them,
unfortunately they lost all their stories from the story bag. Kids are about to go back to
their respective houses, suddenly a character "Time" comes & narrates two different
stories in which some destructive & greedy minds are trying to harm nature, but unitedly

other good people fail their bad wishes. After listening these two stories kids feel that in
the story world at the end all environment related problems get solved, but what about
their own world who will take initiative to change it and they sing for a different pollution
& trouble free world.
