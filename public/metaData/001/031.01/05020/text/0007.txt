Synopsis
Nepal is a tiny mountainous country situated in the laps of the great Himalayas.
Endowed with fragrant beauty of nature, this country boasts of a very rich culture and
heritage. Being the birth place of Lord Buddha, Nepal is a dream destination for many
a people around the globe. However, this subtle land was stirred with people's war in
l 995 that broke out in the western hills and spread all over the nation in no time. Loss of

more than fifteen thousand lives and destruction of abundant property and ifra structure
has derailed our history. With the political upheaval of 2006, peace agreement has
been reached between the Maoist rebels and the government but the clouds of

uncertainty still hover.
Thousands of innocent children were left parentless during the conflict. Even

after the fast moving democratic scenario in the recent years in the country, the conflict
affected children are still left unheard.
This one-act play is an attempt to disclose the sad stories of such destitute
orphans in the remote hills of Nepal. The naive infants of the hills are compared with the

shadows that have no objective for or significance for the so-called technocrats of politics.
