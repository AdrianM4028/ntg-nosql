THE RIGHT SIZE
THE RIGHT SIZE was formed in January 1988 by Sean Foley,
Hamish McColl and Micheline Vandepoel. Since then they have created an

international reputation for making people laugh, With comic theatre that is
surreal, eccentric and surprisingly moving. In all their shows,
extraordinary physical routines combine with gripping stories, Visual jokes with
absurdly human characters.
Their first show, QUE SERA, was rehearsed in Brussels and toured Britain and

Belgium during 1988. Each subsequent production has continued to expand the
touring horizons of the Company. THE RIGHT SIZE has been seen in Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Egypt, Brazil, Senegal and throughout Europe under the

auspices of The British Council.
THE RIGHT SIZE continues to grow. The Company was awarded ACE

franchise funding 'for '94 / 5 to â€™97/ 8. PENNY DREADFUL (1993) was awarded the
Vernons Pools / Liverpool Echo award for Best Touring Event. MOOSE (1992) was

revived for a sell-out run as part of the London Mime Festival at The South Bank
Centre in 1994. STOP CALLING ME VERNON was a runaway'hit at the Edinburgh
Festival 1994 and at the inaugural London Comedy Festival.
