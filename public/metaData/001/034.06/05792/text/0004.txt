५. On an old vaudeville stage, Austin and Porter fall out of bed into

their hackneyed double-act for could be the last time. A string of
hilariously failed sketches is followed by an heroic attempt at High Drama and
finally topped with the duo’s own anarchic classic,
"Waiter on Elastic".
A truly hilarious and touching piece about partnership,
Stop Calling Me Vernon is both surreal and dangerously realistic :
a collision of slapstic, extraordinary Visual gags, eccentric dance,
songs, and beautifully insane repartee.

Are The Right Size theatre or comedy ? Who cares when they're
this funny, pertinent and profound.
William Cook - The Guardian

"A play which is more like a silent film comedy than
a play and sometimes more like a music-hall turn...
indescribably funny".
Miles Kington - The Independent
