Out ofJoint is a recently formed English theatre comp
nally
creating a body of new work for the stage and touring this work natio
and internationally. Since The Queen and I by Sue Townsend in 1994,

Out of Joint has produced The Libertine by Stephen Jeffreys, The Steward
of Christendom by Sebastian Barry and The Break ofDay by Timberlake
Wertenbaker. In order to gain access to a Wider audience than new work

often commands, OJO has frequently paired a new play with a classic.
This in turn has enabled OJO to offer actors the opportunity to work in

an ensemble over a period of six months. This indeed was the pattern
followed with Three Sisters which was originally paired with Timberlak e
Wertenbaker'5 The Break ofDay: both plays were written at the end of
one century and both look forward to eventsin the next : in Wertenbaker's
play with some alarm, but in Chekhov's with a spirited optimism.

With the wisdom of hindsight we know that Chekhov was writing on the
eve of enormous change. Some sense of this pervades his work : as a
doctor and a man of science he was committed to improvement. "Think
what you will," he writes in a letter, "but science is inexorably moving
forward, social consciousness is on the increase, moral issues are

beginning to take on a more disturbing character. " Chekhov's Views are
expressed in Three Sisters by Vershinin whose arrival into the genteel

world of decaying aristocracy occupied by the sisters in turn inﬂuences
them and moves them towards the qualiﬁed optimism expressed in the

final moments of Chekhov's magniﬁcent play.
