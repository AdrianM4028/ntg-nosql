About the Group :

The Little

Theatre Group,

which now owns

the old Minerva

Theatre, was formed in 1947 as an English-speaking group with the object

of bringing foreign classics to Bengali audience.

From 1947 to 1953 it

presented a number of plays by Shaw, Shakespeare and Odets.
In 1953 it was felt

that a truly

popular

th ea tre—grou p

must

inevitably speak in the language of the people and the L. T. G. switched
over to Bengali plays. From 1953 to 1959 it successfully staged plays
numbering more than twenty-ﬁve, some of which had continuous run
for more than 50 nights.

The plays included .nineteenth century Bengali

classics, Bengali rendering of foreign classics and modern dramas of progressive writers.

In 1959 the L. T. G. had established itself as the busiest non-

professional group in the country.

It had repeatedly toured the country, -

and had played to working-class audience in barns, godowns and streetcorners.

This was the principal characteristic of the L. T. G. at this

period—extreme

mobility,

which

enabled

it to

reach all

classes of

au d ien c e .

OnJunelO, 1959, the L. T. G. leased the Minerva Theatre.

It

was a derelict theatre now, but great traditions are associated with it,

because Girish Ghosh, the great actor of the late nineteenth century, was

its founder, and it was here that his plays brought on the fury of the British
imperialists.

The regular commercial theatre in Calcutta now faced a challenge
for the ﬁrst time.
