This is a story of the coalmines. It is the story of Binu, a
young shotﬁrer and his mother, and their dreams of a home in the
hills. Rupa, the girl next door, strays into their life, and she dreams
of a garden of roses. But life underground is hard, and Scene One
ends with an explosion that kills Dinanath, to
whom
Binu was
apprenticed.
Scene Two takes us to the pithead ; the workers leave the pit
because of gas. The management tries force and only brings about
a strike.

Scene Three opens a month and a half later. The strike is
still on, and poverty has disillusioned the mother.
Her dreams have
collapsed and she nags her son.
The company makes an olTer—a
shotﬁrer and a gang of miners to blow the wall of 42 Dip, so that
natural ventilation will disperse the gas.
Instead, fat bonus and strike
period wages. Hunger drives seven desperate men to agree. An explosion
shakes the colony.
Scene Four brings us to the devastated pithead. The seven are
trapped a thousand feet below and rescue operations are in full
swing. Mothers, fathers, wives wait. The rescue team returns to report ﬁre underground. The company decides to save property rather
than life, and bursts the underground dykes to ﬂood the mines.
Binu’s mother distributes snacks to everybody; she believes they are
working to save her son.
Scene Five takes us to 36 Dip where the seven are trapped and
they wait for death, and ﬁnally rise above it.

vengeance on his own people, whom Sumitra tries to protect.
Failing
in this, she escapes to the temple of the Sun in Kashmir, with Bikram
