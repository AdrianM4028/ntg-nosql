RAJANIGANDHA may be summed up as a

RAJ AN I GA N D H A

play dealing with four characters in search
of life’s meaning each distorting the other’s lives

in the process.

For the unsuccessful

actress the answer seems to lie in suicide.

ﬁ1 m
To

her rescuer, a professor, it is in helping her to
see new dimensions in the courage we bring to
our living. To the impoverished ﬁlm director,
who contributes to the heroine’s unhappiness,
it is a single-minded devotion to his own selfish
interests, while a good-for-nothing rich young
man seeks salvation in a brotherly attachment
to her. In the personal drama involving these
four are worked out the tangled complexities of
emotional conﬂict and personal interactions
leading inexorably to the end as in the beginning—- self- destruction .
