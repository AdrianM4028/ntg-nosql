we see him at his hour of defeat: a professional
politician, the morning after he has been
defeated at the polls and assaulted by his
embittered constituents. Knocked unconscious,

he has been picked up by a friend who leaves
him in the safe, inconspicuous care of his
mistress.
Now as he recovers in the thoughtful cornpany of a woman who would answer his needs
but not his curiosity, he calmly reviews his past
life. He realises that he has lost more than an
election ; he has forfeited his treasured life of

an academic. He had forsaken it for a political
career which has forced him to exploit the
people as he has been exploited by his party.
An alcoholic puppet on an ideological string
he revels now in a false glory, unloved by his
children who are virtual strangers or by his
amoral, amorous wife, busy furthering her social
ambitious.

His self—appraisal is interrupted by a sudden
power failure which drives his attractive companion, so far a picture of self-possession, hysteri—

DIPANW'ITA ROY

Unlikely companions in an improbable situation,
the man and the woman now speculate wistfully
of the life they would have lived if they could
start all over again ; he with his books and
students and she with her music and painting
amidst nature’s splendours.
Then the fateful telephone call comes from the
, girl ' s keeper informing them of the hero’s
eventual victory in the election on a recount.
The girl watches in horror as the man slowly
transforms before her eyes into the hypocritical,
vacuous politician he was before, a puppet

jubilantly impatient to dance
tr i u m p h .

The girl, however, a lost woman, who has had

a ﬂeeting glimpse of his true self, his essential
hopes and passions, watches the lost man in
inﬁnite sadness and knows this to be his hour of
shame, of supreme defeat.
