It is not a story, much less a ghost;story.
There is no plot. There is no dialogue. It
is not an Arabian Night wafted out of the past
into View. It is not a bright and dazzling
phantasy of which a Collector of cotton duties
going to ofﬁce in working clothes and a Sola hat
would be capable of conceiving. It is something
unique in litreature and grips you by a fascinating picture presenting scenes and attitudes and
pursuits of a will 0’ the wisp with the rapidity of
a cinema. It touches every chord in your heart
by the glimpse it gives into the eternal mysteries
of pleasure and love that are of universal
interest.
It is not the story of a harem.

The whole

secret of cits charm is the pathos of the life of a
woman imprisoned like a bird in a cage, be the
cage golden. W'oman still is a mystery. Round
her there is still a subtle purdah. The story
has brought out in vivid snatches the anguish
of unsatisﬁed longings and of broken hearts, and
of hunger for love that found no utterance in
life but passed into the stones of the enchanted .
castle now standing deserted at a desolate spot.
Pleasure-domes have vanished, but the story
is the story of life itself. kept from view,
but known to every heart not altogether dead,
