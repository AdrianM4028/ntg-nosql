ST AG E- AU D IT0 RIU M— Our Auditorium

which was constructed towards the end of 1955, provides in the words of THE STATESMAN

“a well equipped and excellently designed miniature stage and auditorium which for
the ﬁrst time uphold opportunities to the various dramatic groups with meagre resources to
produce experimental plays regularly.’ ' And this Auditorium of ours was graced with perfor-

mance of even Sisir Kumar Bhaduri, the doyen of the Indian Theatre.
DRAMA COMPETITIONmThe Centre organised One-Act Drama Competition for
successive ﬁve years commencing from 1955, which as the Arnrita Bazar Patrika stated to be
the ﬁrst thing of its kind in India, and provided opportunities to the budding amateurs not.
v only to put up and present performances at a very small cost but also to come in contact with

sister teams and beneﬁt each other by exchange of views and view points. The merit of such
plays in the competition was adjudicated by a Board of Judges comprised of Sri Ahindra
Chaudhuri, Sri Tara Sankar Banerjee, Sri Sombhu Mitra, Sri Prafulla RoyygSri Mohan Singh.

Sengar, Sri Premendra Mitra, Sri K. M. Lodha and Sri B. M. Singhi. Prizes were awarded on
the result of the competition. Soon this One—Act Drama Competition became very popular
and other institutions organised and are still organising such competitions.
