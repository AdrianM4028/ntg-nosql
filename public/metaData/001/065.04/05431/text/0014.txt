' RAJANIGANDHA
( a modern social tragedy)

Friday, IOth September 6-30 p. m.

Rajanigandha may be summed up as a play dealing with
four characters in search of life’s meaning, each distorting the

other’s life in the process.

For the unsuccessfull ﬁlm actress

the answer seems to lie in suicide; to her rescuer, a professor,

it is in helping her to see new dimensions in the courage we
bring to our living.

To the impoverished ﬁlm director, who

contributes to the heroine’s unhappiness, it is a A single-minded
devotion to his own selﬁsh interests, while a good-for-nothing

rich young man seeks salvation in a brotherly attachment to

her. In the personal drama involving these four are worked
out the tangled complexities of emotional conflict and personal
interactions leading inexorably to the end as in the beginning——
