The Fertilizer Corporation of India is the

biggest producer of chemical

fertilizers in the country. The total capacity of the Corporation’s existing production
units and the chain of its new projects, when completed, will be 537,000 tonnes of
nitrogen and 153,500 tonnes of phosphate annually.
About 59 lakh tonnes of nitrogenous fertilizer valued at Rs. 173 crores, already
produced in the Corporation’s Operating factories, have made a very substantial
contribution in enriching the soil and increasing crop yields.

The Corporation has built up adequate technical know-how. In fact, it is now
equipped to design, engineer and build two major fertilizer plants a year.
CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS ARE THE FARMER’S BEST INVESTMENT
