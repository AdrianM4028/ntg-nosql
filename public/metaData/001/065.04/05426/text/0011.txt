unloved by his children who are virtual strangers or by his amoral, amorous wife busy
furthering her social ambitions
His self-appraisal is interrupted by a sudden power failure which drives his attractive
companion, so far a picture of self-possession, hysterical with fear - a fear of the dark redolent
with memories of a nightmarish past. Torn out of his preoccupation with himself, the hero
offers her a sedative and tenderly puts her to bed.
The next morning he feels himself freer of the humiliation of defeat and better equipped
for a new life. He discovers a deeper afﬁnity with his companion who narrates her idyllic
childhood in a tea estate which ended when she ran away with a personable stranger to the
city.

The young man, only a decoy in the pay of a man who surfaced as a generous friend,
soon disappeared to leave her in the charge of his dubious friend. The girl spurned the
latter’s overtures ; but she had her comeuppance in the dead of night when she was mercilessly
ravished by the vengeful man.

Unlikely companions in an improbable situation, the man and the woman now speculate

wistfully of the life they would have lived if they could start all over again : he with his books
and students and she with her music and painting amidst nature’s splendours.
Then the fateful telephone call comes from the girl’s keeper informing them of the
hero’s eventual Victory in the election on a recount. The girl watches in horror as the man
slowly transforms before her eyes into the hypocritical, vacuous politician he was before, a
puppet jubilantly impatient to dance at his hour of triumph.
The girl, however, a lost woman, who has had a ﬂeeting glimpse of his true self, his
essential hopes and passions, watches, the lost man in inﬁnite sadness and knows this to be
his hour of shame, of supreme defeat.
