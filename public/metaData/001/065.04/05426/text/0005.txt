Affiliated to International Theatre Institute of U.N.E.S.C.O. through the Bharitya Natya
Sangh, THEATRE CENTRE was established in the year 1954. From a very modest beginning,

the Centre extended its activities in various spheres for the promotion and advancement of
Play Production.
STAGE-AUDITORIUM—Our Auditorium which was constructed towards the end of
1955, provides, in the words of THE STATESMAN “a well equipped and excellently designed

miniature stage and auditorium which for the ﬁrst time uphold opportunities to the various
dramatic groups with meagre resources to produce experimental plays regularly.”
And this
Auditorium of ours was graced with the performance of even Sisir Kumar Bhaduri, the doyen
of the Indian Theatre.
DRAMA COMPETITION—The Centre organised One-Act Drama Competition for
successive ﬁve years commencing from 1955- which as the Amrita Bazar Patrika stated to be
the ﬁrst thing of its kind in India, and provided opportunities to the budding amateurs not
only to put up and present performances at a very ‘small cost but also to come in contact with
sister teams and beneﬁt each other by exchange of views and view points. The merit of such
plays in the competition was adjudicated by a Board of Judges comprised of Sri Ahindra
Chaudhuri, Sri Tara Sankar Banerjee, Sri Sornbhu Mitra, Sri Prafulla Roy, Sri Mohan Singh

Sengar, Sri Premendra Mitra, Sri K. M. Lodha and Sri B. M. Singhi.

Prizes were awarded

on the result of the competition. Soon this One-Act Drama competition became very popular
and other institutions organised artd are still organising such competitions.
FESTIVAL OF PLAYS—The Centre also held Festival of plays for four successive yearrs
which assembled in one and the same platform teams presenting plays in languages other than
Bengali, most of whom became distinct by their eﬁicient and laudable productions and to

name some of them are BOHURUPEE, LITTLE THEATRE, MUKHOSH, ANIMIKA (Hindi)
SAJGHAR, AMATEUR THEATRE GROUP (Punjabi) ANDHRA ASSOCIATION
( Telegu ), GUJRATI SAHITYA MONDAL.
