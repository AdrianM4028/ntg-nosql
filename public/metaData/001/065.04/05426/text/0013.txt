RAJANIGANDHA
Rajanigandha may be summed up as a play

dealing

with four characters in search of life’s
meaning each distorting the other’s lives in the

process

For the unsuccessful ﬁlm actress the answer

seems to lie in suicide.

To her rescuer, a professor.

it is in helping her to see new dimensions in the
courage we bring to our living. To the impoverished

ﬁlm director, who contributes

to

the

heroine’s

unhappiness it is a single-minded devotion to his

own selﬁsh interests, while a good-for-nothing rich
young man seeks salvation in a brotherly attachment
to her.

In the personal drama involving these four

are worked out the tangled complexities of emotional

conflict and personal interactions leading inexorably
to the end as in the beginning ——self-destruction.
