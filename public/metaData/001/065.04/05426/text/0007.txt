In 1961. the Centre also started a Drama School, ﬁrst of its kind in Calcutta, for Imparting both practical and theoretical training to the students in all branches of play production.
Project plays are organised by the Students and successful students are awarded certiﬁcates
after proper written Examinations. It also affords opportunities to the students by including
the deserving ones in the Centre’s own team, Two sessions are held every year and the
syllabus has the greatest microscopic quality which is at per with the aims and objectives of the
Centre viz. to promote and develop better understanding with persons interested. The Centre
provides for a well conversant group of lecturers and teachers of eminence in the respective
ﬁelds. The 14th session of the School is now on.
