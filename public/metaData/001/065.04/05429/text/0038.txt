makes a ny evening ।
Friends get together. Soon, you hear the tinkle of
iceccubes. And the gentle music of a good whisky being
poured -— the inauguration of yet another bottle
of Old Tavern. The party lights up and you hear peels
of laughter. Fun. Excitement. And you seem to
forget that the 31 st December is a long way off-as
you revel in the magic of Old Tavern.
Old Tavern -—

sir—"w

for a great get-together
