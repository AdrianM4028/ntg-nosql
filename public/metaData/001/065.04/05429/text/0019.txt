an atmOSphere in which artists and the public could communicate with each other. For that the Centre organized lectures,
discussions and syrnposia.
To make the Centre self-sufﬁcient it constructed in 1955 an
auditorium, which according to the Statesman, is “a well
equipped and excellently designed miniature stage and auditorium which for the ﬁrst time uphold oppotunities to the various
dramatic groups with meagre resources to produce experimental
plays regularly”. The Centre faced a tragic set back when its
stage, auditorium and the equipments were totally damaged by
a ﬁre in 1964. Since then it had to start again almost from the
scratch.

In rebuilding it the Centre acknowledges with gratitude

the grants from the Sangeet Natak Akademi.
The Centre has built a library and a reading room valuable
to any serious student of dramatic art. Efforts are being made
to make it richer with documentary ﬁlms on the development of
dramatic art in different parts of the world.
