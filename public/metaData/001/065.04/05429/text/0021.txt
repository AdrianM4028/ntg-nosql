FROM THE ONLOOKERS
A dedicated group of talented workers engaged in recreating the
great classics of the past, in performing the best plays of our time, in giving
a hearing to new playwrights and in experimenting with new forms and

techniques will leave an indelible mark on the cultural pattern of its
community.

A vital and dynamic theatre must be a committed theatre.

It must believe in the dignity of man and the inviolability of the human
spirit, Significant drama must be more than a record of some aspect of
our existence.
Those who come to the Theatre Centre will find a group of artists,
aware of their responsibilities and determined to make the theatre a meeting
place for free minds dedicated to the glory of Man. These are the important
artists of the Twentieth Century.

I have been a witness in the growth, also in ups and downs of this
unique'Theatre Centre, started by Mr, Roy from the very beginning, since
he returned from Europe as a real Tarun, a youth, with plentiful ideas for
running a theatre and deserves all congratulations as he did prove the

enterprise a success, with his own herculean efforts and iron will. He was
lucky to get the help from his good loyal friends and wish him all the best
in future. I am proud to have associated with this institute.
