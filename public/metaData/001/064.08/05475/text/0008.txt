A perforated drum with
jasmine buds, revolving in a duct.

Appetising smell of sweets ( panjeeri) prepared in a karahi is being sucked by a
blower.
“ Naatshala” has not only created the atmosphere of viewing and listen
ing but of feeling and smelling also. Fragrance of
fr

esh flowers and frying smells of different sweets are generated, tickling
the taste buds of the audience. Air blowers with
duct openin

gs in whole of interiors of the hall are designed in such a way that frag
rance of flowers and other smells can reach
every nook and corner, giving an aesthetic feel of the scene.
