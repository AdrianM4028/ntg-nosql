The multi-dimensional

entry system

Through

multi-dimensional entry system,

entries on the stage can be taken horizontally

as well as vertically. Swings are fitted in the
ceiling to be used for taking entries from

above. A basement under the stage is
constructed. Any section of the stage can be
opened and removed easily to enable the
artists to take entries from underground.
