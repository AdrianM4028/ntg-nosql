The Play : ‘Badha’ depicts the grim tragedy in the life
of a working girl who wilfully sacriﬁced her aspirations and
happiness to the duty of supporting the family.

The play does not seem to have been very poPular With
producers; yet the Kendra has chosen to present it because it
boldly touches an awesome sore in contemporary life — a sore of
the post-war period which has brought about radical changes in
the life of urban families.
‘Badha’ was first produced by the Bharatiya Vidya
Bhawan Kalakendra of Bombay, in the Bombay State Drama
Festival in which it won a place among the highly commended
productions. The play also received one of the Annual Literary
Awards of the Bombay Government in 1959.

The Playwright: Smt. Sarita Padki made her debut
in the literary ﬁeld as a poet. She also writes short stories as
well as one-acters. The play is her maiden hit on the stage.

Smt. Padki was awarded a ‘Humanity’ scholarship last
year by the Government of India, for research in ‘Some Minor
Forms of Sanskrit Drama’.

The Kendra :

‘Badha’ is the third production in the

Natya Kendra’s ﬁrst year of existence. The earlier plays
were—‘TuzeAhe Tujapashi’ (a satire on contemporary puritanism by the famous Writer P. L. Deshpande) and ‘Samshaya
Kallol’ (a traditional musical play by the celebrated playwright
and producer, the late Shri G. B. Deval). To cater to all high
taste is our humble aim.

The Kendra has, in a modest way, been affording opportunities to its members to meet celebrities in the theatre, in
order to help them imbibe the necessary conﬁdence and insight.
Our next step is to give coaching in spoken Hindi to members
and other drama enthusiasts. Obviously, the Kendra wishes to
widen the sphere of its patronage.
