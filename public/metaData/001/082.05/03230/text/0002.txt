Anji comes across several characters and
situations and reaches a nerve-shattering
climax, that compels us to review our
social values once again.

She finally meets her dream man in 21

The whole play is written 111 the traditional
form of Sutradhar of Khed, a folk form of
Maharashtra. Naturalistic treatment

would have marred the whole exercise.
So, a form of continuous improvisations is
used to differentiate between fact and
fantasy. With Harmonium player I’stad
and Tabla playing Sutradhar, we have
tried to create muSical improvisations too,
which enhances the fun and ﬁnally pathos
of the whole situation.
The script had come to me in 1981. but I
could decipher its form and produce it
only by 1925 Since then it has completed
more than 300 shows and audience all
over the country has responded very
positively.
