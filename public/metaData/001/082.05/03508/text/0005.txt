ABOUT TH E PLAY

Goonj is a tender poem of the deep love
between two human beings of two different
generations, a grandfather and a grand
daughter. It is a story of rebirth and of
seeming miracles. lt sings of a future built
on big dreams, which need patience and
perseverance for their fulfillment, and
enduring care for their sustenance. It is the
story of a young girl, seeking the courage to
embrace a glorious future while her
grandfather searches for the wisdom to let
go of the past. It is the simple, lyrical
presentation of play, which will hold, the
audience's involvement and attention.

DIRECTOR'S NOTE
Goonj works at several levels as it takes the
viewer through moments of excitement,
hope and intense despair. A story of a young
girl's desire to be a pop singer and her
grandfather's fear of failure, it moves
beyond the simple conflict between
generations to a host of delicate nuances.

Human vulnerability, the sense of insecurity,
the process of aging, losses one has
incurred on way to being 76, the loneliness
of being left behind by the dead, the failed
human ties, all these contend with the right
to dream of the young. The grandfather and
granddaughter are positioned at opposite
ends of life and disagree about the right to
dream, the nature of dreams and the size of
dreams.
