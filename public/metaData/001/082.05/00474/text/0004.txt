DAK GHAR
Director’s Note

Death is freedom.
It is the unknowable and mysterious manifestation
of serene beauty.
An integral part of life itself.
As everlastingly beautiful as life itself.
The last fulﬁlment of life.
The magical touch of Death gives living a new aspect.
A new dimension.
Death is but the counterpart of life
Exactly like life
Just as you raise your foot when you walk,
So must you lay it down again.
That is why I have always loved life, And
I am certain, shall love Death as well.

Dak-Ghar is the artistic translation of
Tagore’s feelings about Death as exprened in “Geetanjali”
As Tagore himself puts it “Dak Ghar” is like a ﬂeeting
moment in life or an experience accurately caught and given form
by a person of poetic sensibility and dramatic vision.

Amal in “Dak Ghar” is the playwright himself.
Tagore’s heart, yearning for the unknown, for the mysterious
beauty of the other bank of the river, became turbulent
at the memory of the years of his youth as he wrote his
autobiography when he turned 50 Dak-Ghar is a ripple that
surfaced and spread from that inner turbulance.
This play does not ﬁt into the conventional dramatic mould.
It has no story as such. Rather, it is the rainbow of Tagore’s
childhood memories. His desire is to stand upon this
arch that touches the horizon and to ﬁll his eyes with the
wonderous beauty of Death. He passionately desires to travel
further and further till he achieves oneness with the other
life. It is this yearning that constitutes the inner ﬂow of
“Dak Ghar”. It is a poetic play. That is why the lines
between reality and dream in Amal’s life is blurred.
