Dear Brothers Er Sisters of BORTIK,

In this transient planet survival is quite unpredictable.
For a theatre unit it is more so, because they got to
struggle constantly against the evils of the society.

Indeed a struggle for existance.

A strugle against

many hindrances, innurnarable abstacles.
And in such envlronrnent when a team sustains

for a span of 26 yrs., they are really praise-worthy.
Go ahead.

We are always with you.

Brotherly yoursâ€”
