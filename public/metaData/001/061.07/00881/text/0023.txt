RACHNA
(Short dance items)

Movement & Posture
It is a composition of purely creative movements with posture. Movements are

flowing as inspired by the music. There is no theme in it. It is a piece created.
just to give an idea to children about what is dance and how does one go about

creating movement.
Rythmic Patterns
Rythm is something that almost everybody reacts to. During the workshop we
were working on taal by the way of games and exercises and childrenenjoyed
that so muchjust gave a little shape to that.

Improvisation
This piece has been totally improvised by the children themselves.
