An item in pure Bharatanatyam style. It is an invocatory piece on Lord
Ganesh.This item was prepared so that they get an idea about a classical dance
form -its abhinaya aspect and also the pure dance aspect. It was so difficult for
them put they were so keen to do it that one felt inspired to teach them.
A dream- A boy is loaded with his school books which he detests as all children do. Suddenly he decides to forget all the pressure of studies and takes out
a story book and reads in a most leisurely posture. While reading he starts
dozing off and sees a butterfly.
The butterﬂy takes him to a Land of butterflies where he sees all the butterﬂies
dancing. Suddenly he wakes up from his slumber to find that it was only a
dream.

Strength of women-This is the last piece of our effort with children Based on
creative dance movements it exudes energy and strength of women.
The idea was to give them an idea of creative movements interspersed with
pauses and rythmic patterns.
