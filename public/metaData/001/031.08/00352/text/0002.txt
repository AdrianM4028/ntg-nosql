Dear Friend
Non-Group has entered its Second year;

Its first year was marked with hectic activity and

what with 18 productions (not counting that 24 hour get together of music, dance, drama,
films, paintings - SANSKRITI 76) we have firmly put ourselves in the driver’s seat as far as
the Hindi theatre in the Capital goes. Our pride productions included Madhu Rye's
“KUMAR Kl CHATH PAl”, Strindherg's “MISS JULIE," Dr Lal's “VYAKTIGAT,” “UTTAR
YUDH," and “YAKSHA

PRASHAN,"

Samuel Beckett's

"ENDGAME"

Badal Sircar's

“ABU HASAN” Molier’s “MAKHICHOOS,” and Synge’s PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN
WORLD, besides several plays for Television. Perhaps you’ll forgive our quoting the
Hindusthan Times.
"The Non-Group celebrated its first birthday ................................. thus marking a year of
such rich and varied theatrical activity that could be envy of groups decades older."

We promise to build further on this image.

A theatre festival, a film Society, a Library are

some of the features which Non- Group proposes to introduce this year.
