DO YOU KEEP

A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN
AT HOME .7
We mean your wife.
It you think she is not quite equal to you.
here are points to ponder :
She has the right to vote. like you
she has equal working rights

she has equality in the matter of education
and employment
she has her right to property under
inheritance laws.

If she is unable to exercise these rights fully,
ask yourself if YOU look upon her
as an equal citizen.
