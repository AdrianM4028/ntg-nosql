Ahimsa teaches not only to love the human but also the mute
animals and other creatures. Animals and birds are a big source of recrea—
tion to the mankind. In the words of late Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru “Life would
become very dull and colourless if we do not have these , magnificent
animals and birds to look at and play with".

One must abstain from meat eating and drinking of wine which involve
killing of the animals and insects and also have a bad social repercussion.
Gandhi J i in his essay on Vegetarianism says "Vegetarian moral ists

the system,

indulgence in it is immoral and sinful, because

it involves the

infliction of unnecessary pain and cruelty towards harmless animals".
