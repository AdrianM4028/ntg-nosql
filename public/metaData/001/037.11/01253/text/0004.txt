‘ "I‘ranscendent . . . magical . . . a master work that
captures New York. . . . (An) extraordinary high
comedy in which broken connections, mistaken

identities and tragic social, familial, and cultural
schisms...create a hilarious and finally searing
panorama of urban America in precisely our time.’

THE NEW YORK TIMES

“...a careening ride from disorienting comedy
into unexpected pathos and tragedy. . . . A major
creation.”
NEWSWEEK

“Every scene, every character in ‘Six Degrees’
captures the bizarre, self-destructive mood of New

York today. Guare’s brilliance is that he can make
this disturbing portrait hilarious.”
DAILY NEWS

“...a surreal comedy that highlights the confusion
between illusion and reality in the increasingly
chaotic metropolis.”
