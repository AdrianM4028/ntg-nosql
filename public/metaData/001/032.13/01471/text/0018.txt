"O God ! Lead me from darkness to light"

Man's eternal guest. For light is life. And light is
our business. With a production. line of quality torches,
dry cells and miniature bulbs

Right since independence
GEEP’S founder, Late Mr. M.R. Shervani, realised

that portable light source w'll continue to be
one of the basic necessities for hundreds of millons of
Indians, especially where other fruits of
progress will be slower to reach
GEEP is now playing a much wider role
Guided by the philosophy of its founder of delivering
the masses from darkness of fear

ignorance and backwardness. Subserving
’
everything else to common good
