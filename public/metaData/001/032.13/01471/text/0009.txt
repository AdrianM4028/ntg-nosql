A PARVATIYA KALA KENDRA AND INDIAN THEATRE

During the last nine years, ever since we दृ started working on f'olk ballads,

created and composed and

nurtured by the various communities spread over the length, and breath of our country. In
a way they are oral documents containing reactions as ३… also comments of the common

on the various twists and turns of human history.
We also strongly feel the need of developing an operatic theatre as distinct from the
musical one, especially in the Hindi heartland; If we glance around we will find that all
the folk & traditional theatrical f'orms prevalent in the North are operatic in nature, song-

oriented rather than movement oriented,‘ as they are in the South.

This feature should be

given its due place in considering the future course of Indian theatre. We feel, the Parvatiya
Kala Kendra can take legitimate pride in its contribution to the enrichment of this particular
stream of l ndian Theatre.
