On directing the Wild Duck

â€˜

This version of Ibsen's The Wild Duck is made up of the improvisations that
the 111 year students of the National School of Drama did on the play and its various
worlds. The Wild Duck has dead and damaged things, fantastic realms, sinister

creatures, and icy winds. There are connections between objects that lead different
types of lives and that beckon or repel one as the story moves between everyday
furniture and everyday routines.
The students worked through improvisations that led them to think on
presence both human and animal, on costume, on space, especially the garret and its

detritus of mud, leaves and animal litter. They worked on the various types of hidden
and mainfest wranglings that occur in the play and then finally, on how to integrate
these levels of actions with the spoken word.

I am grateful to Ein Lal for having agreed to be a part of this process. Her
video installation endeavors to image these ideas and make a visual configuration. I
hope that the various sets of dialogues between the students, Ein, NibhaJi, Shailaja,
and myself have come together somewhere.
