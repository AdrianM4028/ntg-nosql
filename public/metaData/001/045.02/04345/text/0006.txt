T h e Wild Duck

The Ekdal household, improverished but reasonably content, consists of the
dreamer Hialmar, a photographer by trade, his practical wife Gina, their adolescent
daughter Hedvig; and Old Ekdal, Hialmar's father, a bemsued old grandfather who

keeps a garret full of animals.
Into this scenario comes a boyhood friend of Hialmar, Gregers, the idealistic

son of a businessman named Werle, who is determined to atone his father's many
corruptions. Moving in with the family he relentlessly exposes to Hialmar the deceptions
and illusions that construct their marriage. He hypnotises Hedvig into a game of love
and sacrifice which causes the child to destroy herself. In the name of 'truth' the once
peaceful household falls to pieces.
