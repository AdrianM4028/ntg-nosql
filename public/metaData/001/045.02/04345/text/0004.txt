The playwright

Henrik Ibsen

The background of young Ibsen certainly gave him a sharp eye for social
forces and conflicts arising from differing viewpoints. In small societies, such as the
typical Norwegian coastal town, these social and ideological conflicts are more exposed

than they would be in a larger city. He had seen how conventions, traditions and
norms could exercise a negative control over the individual, create anxiety and inhibit
life.

In Ibsen's world the main character strives towards a goal, but this struggle

leads out into the cold, to loneliness. Yet the possibility of opting for another route is
always there, one can choose human warmth and contact. The problem for Ibsen's
protagonist is that both choices can appear to be good and therefore she/he is not
able to make a decision.

Looking back on 25 years of writing in 1 875, he declared that most of what

he had written involved the contradiction between "ability and aspiration", between
"will and-possibility". In this conflict he saw humanity's and the individuals tragedy
and comedy simultaneously.
In 1879, Ibsen sent Nora Helmet out into the world with a demand that a

woman too must have the freedom to develop as an adult, independent and
responsible person. He took deep and acute problems that afflicted the bourgeois
family and placed them on the stage. On the surface the middle class homes gave an
impression of stability and decorum. But Ibsen dramatizes the hidden conflicts in this
society by opening the doors to the private, secret rooms of the bourgeois homes.
He shows what can be hiding behind the beautiful facades: moral duplicity,
confinement, betrayal and fraud not to mention a constant insecurity, aspects of the

middle class life one was not" supposed to mention in public. Perhaps it is this
unhindered account of human conditions which is the essence of his art.
