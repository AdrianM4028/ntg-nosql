Director’s note

I like the term ‘language expression in theatre’. How the

playwright’s content can be conveyed theatrically creating a
sense of envolvement in the audience’s mind--it is my basic
work.

I would like to experiment for searching some dimension that
will be somewhat different from conventional theatre trend. I try
but I cannot get, I got some hints, I will try later.

I am trying to find something else too, which can give enjoyment
to the audience. Now-a-days, people get bored of theatre
because no change takes place in the style of production from
the past ten years, I think. My main target is— by any means,
audience should be enjoyed the play.
