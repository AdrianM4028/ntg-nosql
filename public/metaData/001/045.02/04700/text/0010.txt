Keeping in mind the French Revolution and its bloody aftermath, the rough
initial scene blockings were done by the direction and design students. The
design students worked on space and compositions whereas the acting
students worked out the re—writing of the songs. All initial song compositions were
done by the students ofacting with help from Jagadish R. A pair ofdesign students each
were assigned a set ofscenes to work on and elaborate.
The direction students had to keep in mind the concept of montage—making with
emphasis on the creation of the arnbience of the scene and the visualisation of
confusion and crises. In the second stage the work proceeded at different levels from
the entire team with detailing of characters, their personalities and the contradictions
and paradoxes in their human nature. At the start up the training in 'Red~Nose
clowning' was taken help of to create some of the scenes like the wedding scene, the
bath ofJussup, the conspiracy scene with Azdak and the Ironshirts. As the play—making
slowly changed its course the emotional graph seemed to change from a merry note in
the beginning towards a more stark and sordid note towards the end of the
performance. The struggle till the end has been to express the most by saying the least.
Robin Das and Sajjad Khan have been working towards the realistic aspects of the
enactment, whereas the design and direction students have been working on the
detailed movements within the scene as well as the inter-relationships between the
characters.
