Over the years Mr. Das has focussed on a series of issues central to theatre activity
such as playrnaking and performance through different methods of formal teaching,
group theatre practices, productions and workshops. His methodology is based on going
into the details of the inter—dependence of different elements of theatre, with the

objective of understanding the complexity of their coming together in order to create
multiple dynamics and resonance, for any given script. In his work he has explored several
areas such as the revival offarce in the contemporary Indian context, realism and modern
theatre, evolution of theatrical choreography, exploration of tribal forms and styles,

dramatization of novels, and development ofplays from multiple sources.
A self—taught draughtsrnan and caricaturist, he continuously strives to renew teaching
methodologies, apart from trying to assimilate the modern and the classical dramatic
pedagog ies.
