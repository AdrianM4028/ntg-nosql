Director's Note
Presenting a novel on stage has its problems. Just picking up the events and selective characters to stage a play
would take away the narrative style and attitude of the novelist. And presenting Fakir Mohan's Chhe Bigha
Zamin, with his witty, sarcastic and multi—layered narrative, makes the task specially difﬁcult.
This complicated task was aptly handled by Mr. Vijay Shrivastava who created the presentation script. Sajjad
Hussain's contribution as associate director helped me to mount the theatrical piece. Ajay Kumar's effective
music direction further enabled us to take the presentation closer to the Odiya 'palagayan' style of narrative ‘
drama; I am thankful to the 3“ year students for having shown the patience and faith to deal with such a complex
theatrical narrative piece.
My heartfelt thanks to all the Departments ofNSD and to the group offguest artists “as wellQ
