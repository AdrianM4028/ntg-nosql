Collectorate of Balasore as a clerk for a short period. He later took up a job as a teacher in the
Mission School of Balasore till 1871 and participated in the discussions of English, Sanskrit

acquainted with John Bims, the then Collector of Balasore, also a pundit who used to write
comparative grammar of different Indian languages. He took Fakir Mohan's help to learn
Oriya, and on getting well acquainted with his caliber, insisted that he be the “Diwan” of
Nilagiri. Thus, Fakir Mohan served as the Diwan of Nilagiri from 1871 to 1875 at a monthly

Sahitya Samaj held in 1912 and in 1917. During his life he wrote many stories, novels and

poems and he was the key creator of modem Oriya short stories and novels. One of the leaders
among authors who wrote against the cruelty of British rule, he revolted against the ongoing
conspiracy to suppress the Oriya language. His steps to establish the Oriya press, publish Oriya

times. Known as the father of modern Oriya literature, his work consists completely of pure

Oriya, melodrama, uncensored images in society and his revolutionary social ideology. He was
