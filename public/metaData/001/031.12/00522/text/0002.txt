spends the night there, Sisir Das’s

Sisir Kurnar Das’s Adim Andhakar
is an intelligently devised play that
mixes past and present with different
sets of circumstances involving two
families who stand on the brink as
estranged couples. On one level, the
play has the makings of a thriller and
on the other, it is something of a
sociological tract that seeks to lay
bare the unspoken thoughts of
people caught in the rnidstrearn of
marital upheavals.

plays to Nabodoy Gosthi which in
turn seems to give considerable
thoughts before launching the
production. The result has been

Adim Andhakar tries to plumb the
depth of elemental passion that is
capable of wrecking many a personal
tie, seemingly built up in most cases
on sentiments too fragile to withstand
the revelation of unsavoury truth.
