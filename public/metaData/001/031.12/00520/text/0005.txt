MESSAGE or: CONDOLENCE '

demise of our ever admirer Shri ABANI SEN, a renowned artist of India, who was

actively associated with us.

This is yet another tremendous shock we received recently

setback to NABODOY GOSTHI mainly because his absence will considerably upset the ever

of great value to us in discharging different aspects of our cultural activities. In fact, it
is a grave loss to us and in turn to the nation as a whole. We will try to accomplish his
unfinished task in the years to come.
We express our profound sorrow and deep sympathy at this tragic loss to his

relatives and friends.
