different times. Though this increased interest in cultural involvement is getting
momentum steadily, but still, one has to admit that performing of dramas or any
other cultural activities regularly, or at intervals, in Delhi involves numerous

problems which can actually be overcome with great difficulty. One has to note in
disguest that though the performance and the standards of these activities has
shown marked improvement, but still the organisers ﬁnds it too difficult to ﬁll in
the audience to the packed capacity. It rarely happens with any amateur organi—
sations to sell all the tickets in the auditorium without any push sales. In fact,
one has to pursue the sale of tickets quite earlier to the show and make huge

publicity through different medias to enhance the demand which, in fact, is otherwise quite negligible.

We are also glad and indebed to the various advertisers and well wishers
who have extended their hand of cooperation in making our ventures successful.
Lastly, I thank you all who have made it convenient to assemble here at

this auditorium to witness this play. I sincerely hope our efforts will be successful and you all will like this play. I cherish further cooperation from you in this
matter in the years to come.
Thank you.
