I am happy to learn that Nabodoy Gosthi is bringing;out
a Souvenir on the occasion of its Annual Day Function
in August.

Cultural organisation like this have an important role
to play in national life as these encourage new talent
and the finer qualities among the people of the
country.

I convey my best wishes and wish the programme

a grand success.
