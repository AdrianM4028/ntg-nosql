Jogesh Dutta And His Art
From his very childhood Jogesh Dutta had an instinct for phenomenal art.
Disinterested in the humdrum of daily life, this young orphan used to run away

frequently from his uncle’s house in search of variety. Initially a carricaturist he
soon developed into a powerful stage actor ; but success as a comedian did not
satisfy him. The urge to do something original was always in his mind. Struggling
alone against an unsympathetic home, ridden by poverty, he sat for days on end

before a mirror and pictured himself in all sorts of expressions. A perfectionist to
the core.

he ﬁnally succeeded in adopting the art of Mime in his own style and

gave expression of this art Monologue.

Soliloquey and dance.

This versatile

artist did not limit his art within the sphere of stage only but spread it

horizons of ﬁlm marking.
Mime ﬁlms.
