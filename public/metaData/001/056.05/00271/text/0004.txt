Director’s Note

Cl EK AUR

AJNABI

portrays

the

dilemma of a sensitive, intelligent girl

who ﬁnds herself torn between her

desire to live a fuller life and the social
norms and expectations.
Now there

is nothing spectacularly

new about the idea but what is fascina—
ting is the sensitive treatment of the
theme—at diﬁerent levels. There is no
drama in the play—that can be both
the strength and weakness of the play.

It attempts to create the ﬂavour of life
through minute realistic details that

highlight Shani's

inner conflict and
contradiction in different values, juxtaposed with a fuller, more open life of
the Stree and Purush—a life that Shani
longs for. Even if it is only for a
moment—she wants to live without any
pretense, to be herself, but she can’t.

She is faced with
mohan who

with

people
his

like Jag-

limited

vision
is only baffled by Shani’s demands.
Then comes lnder Khosla. In her des-

perate desire to make her dream come
true she pins her hopes on him —0nly
to discover him as yet another stranger!
