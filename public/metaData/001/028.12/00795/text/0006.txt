ALI BA BA
Monday, October 28th, 1985
Bengali, 1937, 120 mins

Based on a story adapted from the Arabian Nights, written
by Pt. Kshirodeprasad Vidyavinode, it is the same
Alibaba-Kasam-Marjina-40 thieves story told in Bengali.
For the first time a kind of stylised approach was noticed
in Bengali Cinema. Due to the operatic base of the
original play, the film's presentation has been musical
throughout, helped by Sadhona Boseâ€™s brilliant choreography. The virtuosity of Sadhona found a new eXpression in the role of Marjina and her acting brought out a
new facet of the sophistication that was so marked in her

appearance.
