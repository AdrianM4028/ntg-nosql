Love in the form of a gentle but strict policeman comes
into the life of a dancing girl from the infamous localities

of the city. She sees in him the first remote sign of a
home and family. But the climb towards that goal is
difficult and full of conscience pricks. which shake her
confidence and drag her down. She keeps away from

him.

Finally when she gets involved in a murder, again

for his sake, and sentenced for life, the advise she sends
him is not to ruin his life merely for the sake of love.
Shantaram's answer to the pessimistic approach to life

propagated by films like New Theatre's "DEVDAS".

Deals with an unscruplous woman who quarrels with her

to his rich family that he is away on a business trip, after
which, the film turns into a real horror piece, including
the now famous axe-murder. First feature film of director
Coppola, appears to be a quickie. But Coppola has confidently assembled the film and given it a sharp sense of
atmosphere.
