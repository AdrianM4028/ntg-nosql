Mr. Hulot lives in an old house; his nephew and his
parents -the Arpels- live in an ultra modern, functional

house. The film contrasts the life style of the gentle
Hulot, with the regirnentation and soul-lessness of the
Arpels’ life. This is a satire not on modernism, but on the
middle class who think they are modern. As the director

puts it 'I meant to suggest a return to gentleness through
a defence of individuality in the film’s ultimately optimistic point of view.
