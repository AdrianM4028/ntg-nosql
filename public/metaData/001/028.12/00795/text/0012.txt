The film recreates the fading feudal world of Lucknow
Nawabs, projecting the conflict
between romantic
longingsaud social

mores of

Muslim

aristocracy of a

bygone day. Mehboob brings a fascinating fluidity to the
narrative, deploying close-ups, crane shots and the rest,
effectively, to get the desired results. A towering source
of strength for him is Veena in the title role, who provides what must be one of the bewitching portraits of
feminine grace and charm, on Indian Screen.

This was

the first production of Mehboob's own company.
Dir. : Mehboob
with Ashok Kurnar, Veena, Sitara, Murad
