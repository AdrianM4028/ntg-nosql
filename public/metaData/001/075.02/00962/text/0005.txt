The Cathartic Possibility

,the aCtOT and the stage, the actor
on the stage,.Around him is space,”
to be filled and defined by movement;

around him is also a silence to be

filled with meaning, using words
sounds,

and at moments when all else

fails him, including my words, the
silence itself.

I write plays because I believe
implicitly in the potential of this
iexperience‘as a means to approa—
ching and transmitting Truth, and
in a way and wath a force unique to
the drama.
I believe equally strongly that this potential is at its
greatest when the tricks associated
with so much of present day theatre
are reduced to a minimum.
A lot
needs to be said today about now
much the 'miracle of electric light’,
'the ingenious use of offustage

sound', and ‘clever decor', have
hindered and reduced this potential.

To repeat myself, but using dim
.fferent words; the cathartic

possibility in theatre needs
nothing more than the actor and
the stage.
For the miracle to
happen it must come-from within
the actor.
A good play will
plant the seed there.
Externals
will profit the play nothing, if
the actor has no soul.

I really love actors because
they are the instrument— as
precious as a StradivariuSHfor
me.
An actor is total carnality
_ all he can use to get at you
is his body, his flesh, his
voice, his sense of self.
Lone"
liness can only be finally what
an actor understands about lone~
liness.
It's dangerous ground
because you have to go into the
actor you have to be so bloody
