The Cpllaborative Approach

The_Magic Encounter

This 'different way‘ led to a
group of plays,

including Sizwe Bansi

Is Dead and The Island, that were the
result of a collaborative effort
between Fugard's actors and himself
as ‘scribe'. About this processhe
-=has stated.:

You've got to keep company with
actors who are capable of something
that almost approximates.to Zen
spontaneity, that is totally without inhibition,actors who can just
throw all of themselves into a response to a challenge that you present
them with.

It reguires a very special sobreity
to look after actors in that context

दृ because, basically, you’re askmgg
them to walk out into very dangerous
territory. It requires a very very
special energy, a very special

दृ

sobreity, and concern and accuracy
in keeping company with them and
going through the mine fields with
them.

It starts with-absolutely

श्री which the actor cannot

'stake'

his

. personal truth, and in the absence
of words on pcper that personal truth

~

has been our only capital. I cannot
stress this factor in strong enough
terms. Pretence and deception are
as fatal as they would be in a

writer's priter's private relationship with paper.

In making these plays, I have

,

kept company with a group of remarkable
actors. Their courage has at times
frightened me. I have lived constantly with the fear of our work
degenerating into a dangerouBs game

with personalities.

B.S.R

Without this primary
involvement with the actor I
would never have ended up
'making' theatre with them..
It is partly for this reason
also that I have directedvmost
of my plays in their first
productions. not because I felt
that as the author I was in
possession of the interpretatior
either of the play as;a whole
or the specific characters, but
because I have always regarded

the completed text as being
only a half—way stage to my
ultimate objective-the living
performance and its particular
definition of space and silence.

You see, I worship the

ac
actor holy. Theatre is not
words on paper, not scenery,
light or make-up, but that
magical thing that can only
happen when an actor is there
in the flesh, encountering
a live spectator. And in that
encounter the actor is the key
person. It is he who must expose himself in order to make
something happen.

Like Artaud, I believe

himself alive and wave at the
audience through the flames.
I'm lucky. my actors are life
that.
