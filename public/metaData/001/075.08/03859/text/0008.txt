Chhau Dance Style

On the map of India, Chhau Dance area is situated
on the border of Orissa, Bihar and Bengal. These
were small princely States—namely, Saraikala, Mayurbhanj and Puralia—f'ormerly in the province of Orissa.

“Mundari” word “Chhak” means Ghos. From “Chhak”
the word Chhau can be derived philologically."Chhata”

festival respectively and from pseude sanskrit word San
