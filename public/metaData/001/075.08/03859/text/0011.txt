or curtainraiser.
In the past Chhau had the Vidhushak- Pranalika
before the actual dance items begin Two characters
appear on the stage. They were called Kaji-Paji. Paji
asks the question and Kaji will reply. Thus togethe they
introduce the theme by movements, music and partly
by dialoge but these days this part is omitted.

In the music of Chhau dance songs and words are
not used for interpreting various theme and stories. In
stead dancers depict only through movements and expre
ssions- By the body movement artists will give anima
tion to the totality and feeling relevant to a theme, symb
olically expressed. Guruas of Chhau dance style were

not orthodox in their approach and understanding They
have imbibed and assimilated many elements from
other dance styles and tribal dances of the surrounding
area with the result that the vocabulary of Chhau danc
style is very rich and elaborate. Chhau dance in its present shape and stylizatioan, steping, music and other
f'acets has obviously taken long time to evolve, in course
of which it has been subjected to the requirements of
