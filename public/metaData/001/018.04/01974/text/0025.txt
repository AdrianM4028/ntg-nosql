We Are .... . . ?
We would like to introduce ourselves as theatre workers ’

who basically hail from various business ﬁelds in theatre
but because of our strong afﬁniety ard dedication to the
common platform ofArt and Culture, we came into coexistance about 18 years back with an objective of opening
yet another view to theatre chauv-inists who otherwise
remain in oblivion & thcir telents rarely get explored due
te lack of encouragement & proper opportunities. True
to our nzme, ‘Lok Kala Manch, our aim is to develop

and insight the artful Punjabi theatre ‘of the People, for
the people and by the people; As in respect of developing
reoritntation, reﬁning and promoting public interest
towards rec0gnising theatre & popularising its utmost

values as living and inspiring art.

With a“Wish" and yearn—

ing to promote Punjabi theatre, we, the members ofthe
group want to stage plays in Punjabi, making Chandigarh
and Delhi our Head quarters and then visiting other cities,
towns and villages with our performances. We knows

that our performances Will be just like a drop in the ocean,
but even to breath new life into the stale, decaying and

limping, Punjabi Theatre ‘one must reject the cheap
entertainments which corrupt audience taste and promote
vulgar responses. Equally harmful are the plays beyond
the reach of the common man. Therefore following the
middle path, we want to dramatisz artistic scripts which

would entertain as well as educate; in the form of a sugar
coated pill. Of course it is a tremendous task, requiring
time patience and perservance, but attainable with the help
and co-operation of the audiance.
