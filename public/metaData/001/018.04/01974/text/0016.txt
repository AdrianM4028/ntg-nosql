I am glad that the Lok Kala Manch is organising a competition of traditional and folkart forms

in the Ô¨Åeld: of performing arts for the North Zone.

It. is a commendable venture and I arn sure it Would

bring forth the rich treasure that. the Northern regiom possesses

in

this regard.

This wouldalso not

only bring the various, cultural traits and traditions on one platef'orm, but would also go a long way
towards strengthening the forces of national integration.
Irwisheyour venture a success.
