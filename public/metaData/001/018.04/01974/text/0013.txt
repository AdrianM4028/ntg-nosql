Pravesh Sethi
all in one ....
I

Some one says, “Two swords cannot be adjusted within a cover,’

but seeing the

Pravesh Sethi as an artist (stage & ﬁlm), a director and make-up man,

the statement

proves wrong. In every ﬁeld he is the master. A Haryana govt. gazzatted ofﬁcer (in H.F.C.)

Mr. Sethi looks busy everytime in auy ﬁeld. Either he didn’t got the chance to collect the
degree of Dramatic Arts from any institution but with his mental leVel & personnel study he
proves that simply training cannot shape the man as artist, but it is the hard workand
creative approach that follow the target of artistic standard.
There are his personnel

qualities & artistic standard that he not only directed

‘chattrian’ and other plays, acted more than 100 plays & ﬁlms, & make up the artists of every
standardised production of Punjab but moved abroad also. So many times he got awards
& prizes from various institutions.
It is his work & contribution in the ﬁeld of art & culture that ﬁrst time Lok Kala
Manch (Regd.) made up its mind to honour the ﬁeld of stage craft. May God bless him
with success in his ﬁeld of theatre & life.
