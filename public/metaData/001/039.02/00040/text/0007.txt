Besides the use of Narrators, who do not only ’narrate'
but also indulge in interplay with the characters, the other
interesting feature of the play's form is the dividing of the

principal Characters in two ; each has an ’lnner Self' or
-‘Conscience'. Although the author intended the Inner Selves to
be recorded voices only, we have physicalised and animated

them. In a sense, there are sometimes two plays being enacted
I
simultaneously, the one commenting on the other.
In 3 Preface to the play, Cousin writes :
“It is not necessary that drama be a bore because it deals

with the major problems confronting contemporary mankind.
It should be a means of recreation, or re-creation, that is, of

awakening us to a new existence. It should afford all of us,
alienated and isolated as we are in the mechanical routine of

our daily lives, a chance to change, to be refreshed.
