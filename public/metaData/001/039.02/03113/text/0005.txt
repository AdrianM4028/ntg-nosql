JOURNEY OF D ES I G N
The National School of Drama has experimented with space and design over
the last several years. In the course of its experimentation, it has provided a
wude range of experiences to the audience.
NSD has made us of existing monuments for the performance of plays. The
playing spaces have been organised around the architectural features of the
monuments and these have worked both as the background as well as
foreground for the story.

There has been an imaginative use of closed spaces. The Studio Theatre of

l

NSD has ben usd strictly as a proscenium theatre on the one hand, but in this
tiny space plays of epic dimensions have also been performed that break the
proscenium frame.
The Meghdoot Open Air Theatre has been able to provide designers with a
very flexible playing area. This is a space that expands or contracts in
response to design. The magnificent peepal tree has been a witness to all
these designs apart form being a natural grid for the lamps. It has been able
to knit the designs together by casting a magical pattern of light and shadow
on the ground. The Meghdoot space has allowed fora variety of styles,
wheather they be formalistic, environmental or realistic designs. Perhaps, it is
not out of place to say that NSD scenography has evolved as much as it has
done because of this space.
This exhibition has models of only some representative designs to illustrate the
range and usage of various spaces.
