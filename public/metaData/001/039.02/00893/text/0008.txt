D IRECTOR'S NOTE

This production is an attempt to understand the language of theatre being
faithful to the text. .We tried uttermost to stick to the written text to find a
form of expression. The travel of the play from apparent realistic framework

to symbolic level has been tried to capture without being overdone. The play
of Amn lslands written in 19th century has been tried to recontexualize in our
contemporary coastal life specifically of Eastern India with which I have a
a few
close proximity till my childhood. It is only an aspiration to capture
. moments of simple 'truth' in its' own subtle greatness.
