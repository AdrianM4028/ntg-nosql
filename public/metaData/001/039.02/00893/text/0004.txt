Born in 1871, LM. Synge, was grown up in
a prostestant milieu. Alter his
studies in Dublin he aimed to be a musician and
travelled quite widely thrmngh

the Europe. In France he became more attracted
to literature and had an
esctensive study of French neo—classical literature whil
e it was “(8. Yeats who

suggested him to leave Pariss am’ go back to the Aran
Islands. He came back
and afteryears tried to capture the reality of das
Volk of Aran Islands :uul

nuances of Gaelic culture - which gave his
writing a rememberance

of epic
national past. His plays, though not overtly polit
ical, speaks a lot about
opper
ession and hierarchy

and criticises the evils of society in its own
special
way “hieh Yeats has rightly pointed out when
he commented on Synge that lit
the arts, he knew
no language but his own'.
