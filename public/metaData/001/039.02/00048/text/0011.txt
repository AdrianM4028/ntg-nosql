Phyrgian Mode, the Pythgorean Mode, embracing parti—
cular scales of musical notation.
Because performances were held out-doors in the large
amphitheatres musical speeches have been employed
partly for practical accoustical reasons, the singing voices
carrying further than the speaking voice. To help the
chorus and singer—actors, musical instruments such as
pipes and lute or harp were also used.
Solo and choral, both types of singing were employed in
Greek Tragedies. The chorus was divided between a well
trained group leader or leaders who at times sang alternatingly with the group, or with one of the actors. All
singing was in unison.
The varying emotional contents of text passages may
have determined the kind of speech used, musical or
otherwise.
Like other kinds of Greek Music, instruments may have
accompanied by playing along the vocal line, at times
varying and ornamenting the tragedies. They also may
have provided interludes.

Masks and Costumes in Greek Plays: Greek actors
represented the first gods and heroes of mythology but
they never attempted to produce the accurate imitations
of the described costumes of the Homeric period. This
way they were totally opposed to all modern notions upon
the subject. Such costumes were, therefore, different
from daily costumes and accurate mythological costumes,
but retained the dignified and more flowing dress-form,
common to Greece, the innovations being that the bulk
of the actor was increased by padding his chest and
limbs and placing huge wooden soles under his feet.
Masks were employed in which every feature was
exaggerated to give superhuman dignity and tenor to the
expression.
