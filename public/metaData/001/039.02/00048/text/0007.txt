knows all the answers and blind Tiresias, the wise
vessel of divine wisdom, is crucial. Oedipus boasts of
solving the riddle of the Sphinx. His answer of ”Man"
is what he must be. Having lived his dawn, having lived
his noon, he now must go out into the darkness of this
very evening, groping his way out with a staff. Oedipus,
”Swollen Foot”, must become Oidipous”, He who knows
his feet’.
This most pitiful and fearful of tragedies says to the
spectator ”De te fabula"——"This is your story.” And the
most ironic scene in this masterpiece of tragic irony is
the last, when Creon and Chorus look on Oedipus as
being different from themselves, complacently viewing
his problem as one in which they are not involved and
congratulating themselves that their fate is not as his.

Drama and the Festival of Dionysius: Festival in honour
of Dionysius or Bacchus, god of fertility and especially of
wine, provided the setting for the outstanding literary
product of Athenian democracy drama. At the Great
Dionysia, the spring festival of the god, and again on a
minor scale at his winter festival, the Lenaea, several days
were devoted to contests in tragedy and comedy. The
judges were citizens picked to give a verdict on behalf of
all. The performances were financed by wealthy citizens.
The Great Dionysia was a spectacular ritual occasion, at
which the chief seat of honour was given to Dionysius'
priest; a state holiday so general that even prisoners were
released on bail to attend; a meeting point for visitors
from the whole Hellenic word, to whom the city displayed
the brilliance of her culture.
The 5th century theatre was a unified whole; all those
present were participants in the festival. But they were
divided into three sections, to which the three parts of the
theatre—the skene, the Orchestra and the amphitheatre
correspond.
