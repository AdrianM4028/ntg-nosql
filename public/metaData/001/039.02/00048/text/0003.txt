SOPHOCLES : 497/6 or 495/4 B.C.—406 B.C. Recorded
as having written 123 plays out of which only seven
servive (Philoctetes 409 BC, Antigone 442 B.C., Oedipus
Tyrannus 430-425 BC, Oedipus at Colonus 406 BC,
Ajax, earlier than 442 BC, Electra, later than 425 BC,
and Trachiniai very early).
The Greek tragic playwright Sophocles’s life-Span covers
almost the whole century of Athens’ rise to greatness
and its fall. In the great events of the fifth century he
took full part as an Athenian citizen, holding high office
in peace, as in war. He was treasurer of the Athenian
Naval League, was a general, with Pericles, in the war
Athens fought to suppress the revolt of Samos (441—439),
and a general again in 428. He served often as ambassador
but his love for Athens was so great that he refused
invitations to live at the courts of foreign kings. Handsome
(an important qualification for the appreciative Athenian),
wealthy (his father, Sophillus, owned many slaves and
some kind of mano factory) and successful he was never

placed third in the Tragic Contest), Sophocles seemed to
have been universally popular, both as a dramatist and as

a public figure.

and married his own mother, Epicaste (The Jocasta of
later writers) and that she hanged herself when the

great tribulation, to reign in Thebes, apparently~ until his
death.

Post—Homeric story puts a slightly different version.
According to this story, Laius, King of Thebes was
informed by an oracle that his son would be his slayer.
Therefore, when his wife, Jocasta, bore him a son, he
exiled the child to the mountains, with the spike driven
through his feet, hoping he would die. However, the
