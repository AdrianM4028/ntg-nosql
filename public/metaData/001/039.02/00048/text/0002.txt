Temple of Apollo

SOphocles' OEDIPUS REX and Euripidesâ€™ THE TROJAN
WOMEN were presented by the School during mid sixties.
Translated into Hindustani by J.N. Kaushal, these plays
were directed by E. Alkazi.

We are thankful to the Embassy of Greece for all the help
and assistance given to us in connection with present
production.
