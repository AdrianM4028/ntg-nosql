l
became the earliest formal theatre, while their liturgical
format influenced the shape of the theatre. At the
rites, Dionysiac which started in predawn light, choral
dancers naturally formed a circle around the altar stone.
This became the circular orchestra or chorus area of Greek
theatre. Around the orchestra —the first architecturally

formulated stage, the audience sat in a semicircle on
three sides.
In his history, Herodotus describes the primitive theatres
of his day. Situated on steep hillsides, the seating and
steps were cut into the terrain and secured by wooden
planks and traces. A single storey wood structure was set
behind the chorus area.
Eventually Greek theatres—the seats, the flat round
orchestra, and the 'skene’ backing (from which we derive
our word 'scene')——were all built of stone. Built into the
skene building were three formal entrances facing the
audience. Wing structures called ’periaktoi’, were added
on both sides to create a formal, three—sided setting.
The stark simplicity of this early theatre gradually gave
way to more elaborate stage craft and production.
Painted scenery was introduced. A manually operated
which was used to lower figures of the gods from the top
of the skene. Set-changing devices were employed like
wheeled wagons and three- sided pylons that could be
rotated to expose different set images. More and more
elaborate devices were introduced until visual embellish—
ments and physical paraphernalia shared attention
equally with the spoken word. Yet, for stage lighting the
Greeks wisely, if of necessity, relied on the ultimate visual
drama of the developing sunrise.

As theatre architecture developed, so did the drama itself.
Formalised story telling and formalised acting, and
dancing ultimately blossomed into the great period of
Greek theatre. Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and
Aristophanes created a dramatic art so rich that it has
influenced theatre ever since.
