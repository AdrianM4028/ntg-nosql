planned to organise two intensive short term workshops in
different parts of the country, annually, so that graduates

can explore the local talent and the local theatre forms
of a specific region. Some of our graduates have been
working on these line despite difficulties. The school would
like to encourage such attempts also.
This will feed the school with the talent already
having some exposer to theatre. All efforts will be made
to get the students of the school involved in the theatreâ€”
field, but the emphasis will be on activity and not on
settled employment.

Attempts have been made to give shape to these plans,
but it is too early to comment or judge. Implementation
will unfold gradually: However, the optimism that guides,
is not purely romantic.
