a 'hypokrites', an 'answer' or 'interpreter'who would
deliver speeches or converse with the leader of the
Chorus. Here was, the first actor, bringing alive before the
audience a character only previously described in narra—
tive, adding a new dimension to that vivid presentation of
individuals which pervades all Greek literature. With his
advent, ’drama' ('doing' the story, not meremly telling it)
was born; the name 'tragodia' (goat song) is linked in
some way with the importance of the goat in the worship

of the fertility god Dionysius, in whose honour drama
came to be performed.
How plays became an official part of the Great D ionysia
is a question to which there is a socio—political answer

democracy as versus the reactionary aristocracy. The

development of these beginnings into drama in the full
sense was largely the achievment of Aeschylus (525-456)
whose introduction of a second actor made dialogue
possible independent of the chorus. From this point onwards we have extant plays by the three acknowledged

masters of Greek Tragedy, all presented in the 5th century,
though no precise dates can be given. There are seven
plays by Aeschylus, seven by Sophocles and seventeen
by Euripides.

evidence to know that the dramas were sung or chanted
recited in a musical manner, while the late Renaissance
led to the belief the entire Tragedy was sung, Perhaps this
was due to lack of precise information on this subiect but
preserved examples of Greek Music are stil I in existence
and earlier opera composers attempted to recreate the
manner of singing which they thought to have existed
in Ancient Greece. we know of the Lydian Mode, the
