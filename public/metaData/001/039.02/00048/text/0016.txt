although some deliberate compromises have been made:
(i) the location is outdoors, but the theatre is not built
into a hillside as was the ancient Greek custom. However
we have constructed seating around the ’orchestra' to
recreate the same kind of relationship between the
audience and the actors. Thh placing of an alter in the
orchestra is traditional, reminding as that Greek tragedy
grew out of religious ritual and remained an element in

annual communal religious celebrations.
(ii) the stage—setting (the 'skene’ building) which depicts
the royal palace of Thebes, is not as strictly formalized
as it originally was. A contemporary desire to express
the play’s mood and predominant theme through the
design has been allowed.
(iii) Masks, hairstyles and costumes are not as ’theatrical'
as they perhaps might have been during the 4th century
BC. Designs have been gathered from sources illustrating
day—to-day ’domestic’ attire rather than the spectacular.
(iv) the style of acting evolved is in response to the fact
that ancient Greek actors performed (and still do) before
audience of up to 20,000 people: the style is expansive
and formal in gesture, with a view to recitation of dia—
logue rather than ’naturalistic’ speech. (Aristotle refers us
to the art of Rhetoric.) The Chorus works mainly through
the media of song and dance as was the convention,
although precise knowledge of their form is now lost to
us. We have broken the convention that all performers
were men (even for female characters) and used women,
even in the Chorus.
(v) Finally, we are breaking the tradition of performing in
daylight, and are performing at night with electrical aid.
