Di rector's Note
lt is our responsibility as adults to create awareness and inculcate values such as
kindness, love and forgiveness. ln the past two or three decades terrorism and inﬁltration

have spread its deadly claws allover the world .
’Sparsh Natya Rang’ as a group formed with the interest of spreading theatre to the

masses thought of dealing with this topic in its ﬁrst presentation.
Theatre has been a major form of art in human history, for the spread of personal and
community education. ’KAAFlLA’ tries to explore the minds of few soldiers who display

different emotions. It is an effort create awareness against hatred and anger.
