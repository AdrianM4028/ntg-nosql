About the Play

‘Beg'um Ka Pyada ’
The play ‘Begum Ka Iyada ’ written by Amrit Kashyap,
is a light—hearted comedy set in a one ofits kind middle class

Indian family devoid of the mother-in—law and the father—
in—law. The central characters are the two brothers, Girdhar

and Rakesh and their wives Laxmi and Sunita with the
Stereotype villain beingplayed by the “MAM” Nihal Chand.
MAMA upsets the minds of Girdhar and Rakesh by saying
that they are superior to their wives and both the brothers
must dominate their wives.
Yb worship the wife or, to be worshipped by her; to
dominate or to be dominated by her, is the cental issue.

What unfolds consequently is a “power struggle” with its -

plays and tactics, between the males and thefemales ofthe
house.
'
What does this power struggle lead to, do the scales

remain upset or do they get balanced in someway, who
wins, — the wife ?, the Husband? the ‘MAMA’?, none? or

all? — wait and watch ..... and meanwhile don’t stop
laughing.
