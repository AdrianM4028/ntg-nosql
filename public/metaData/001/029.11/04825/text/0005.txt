Diganta
Diganta Theatre Group is an organisation formed
by eager and aspiring theatre artists in 1998. Diganta
has held a series of performances in the span of these
two years. Its debut production was the dramatisation
of a well known story by Nobel Laureate» Gurudev
Rabindranath Tagore ‘Patni Ka Patra,’ which was followed

by ‘Trishanku’ a play by Shri B M Shah1 Diganta’s last
venture was a hindi adaptation of the story- ‘Yellow Wall
Paper’ by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. As we try to
encapsulate another creation on a platform where there
is live interplay among co actors, where there is
amalgamation of thoughts among actors and viewers
we hope that we live up to your expectations without
whose support this interaction would not have been
possible.
