versatility to portray different characters within very short

intervals of time. Sometimes an actor might have to rehearse one play in the afternoon and perform another in the

personality. Hence respect and responsibility towards his
colleagues and the audience effect a change in the priorities in the life of a theatre. professional.
Although professionalism in theatre is still in it's
nascent stage in Goa, the state is one of the privileged few
to offer a three-year course in theatre Arts and have a
Repertory Company to absorb the trained artistes as well
as untrained local talent in the ration 2:1. A unique feature
of Goa's Repertory Company is that it is multilingual having
actors proficient to perform plays in Marathi, Konkani and
Hindi.
However, well trained an artiste may be and however
enriching the process of his work in the field, he cannot
exist in isolation. He works in a group which has a give-andtake relationship with an audience. Moreover, unlike other
arts, the ones for theatre art is shared between the artistes

and audience alike. It is a discriminating and critically
appreciative audience that shapes the development of
theatre as a true art.
