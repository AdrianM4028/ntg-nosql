(The Repertory Company)
G. S. M a ra t h e

The term "Repertory Company' is perhaps absolutely
unknown to a .majority of theatre lovers of this State of
theatre enthusiasts and to many of them in this country.
The word Repertory has come from "Repertoire"
which means a set of different plays ready to stage at short
notice. The Repertory Company means a professional theatre company having different plays in active production.

In India, a beginning in this field was made by the

Parsis in Bombay, in the second half of the last Century.
Initially it was created by groups of enthusists performing
for their own satisfaction. The growing public response to
these companies gave birth to commercial companies, not
only in Bombay but Calcutta and other parts of the Country.

It is, however, questionable whether these commercial
ventures could be called Repertory Companies in the context of what we visualise today.
