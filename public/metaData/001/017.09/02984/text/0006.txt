tions and hold workshops for the benefit of the trainees.
A natural corollary of the functioning of Theatre Art
faculty for a few years was the establishment of a Repertory
Company - "RANG M ELL" - which could give some scope to
the local talent to show its prowess in the various disciplines of theatre art. It took quite some time for Kala
Academy to crystalise its ideas and thoughts on the formation and functioning of Rang Mell (Repertory Company).
Consultations were held with the authorities of National
School of Drama, New Delhi on modalities of constituting
the Repertory Company and consequently, Shri G. S.
Marathe an experienced artiste at the National School of
Drama was appointed in 1992 as Chief of Repertory Cornpany. Not many States in the country can boast of having
regular Theatre Art Faculty and a Reportory Company, as
in Goa. As a culmination of Kala Academy's efforts in
providing a suitable platform to the local theatrical talent,
"Gidhaad Gatha" the first production of Rang Mell is being
presented on 23/2/93. Kala Academy hopes that this production will be a fore â€” runner of many such productions
which would come forth in course of time.
