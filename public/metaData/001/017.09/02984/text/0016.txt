The rehearsal process, after this, began to have its
ups and downs for the play required many more actors than

the company had in its employ and slowly and steadily the
group grew larger and larger. Although this added fresh
energy to the performance, rehearsal became less personal and the common experience shared in the initial
improvisations was watered down with the doubling of the
strength of the cast, Moreover, blocking the play became
expedient as the numbers grew. But gradually as the new
actors were absorbed into the play, it gained a new and
exciting flavour.
As the chief of the company rightly mentioned, ‘this is
not play of heroes and heroines'. It is a situation, or rather

a series of situations linked together but not falling into any
well-known patterns of dramatic denouement. Here every
single character is responsible for making the play ‘happen' .
