From Mahabhoj to Gidhaad Gatha
S u res h M a rat h e

' It all started with the search for a script for the
Repertory Company's first production. The tests forselection Were very tough. I neither wanted to begin with experi-

mental wo'rk nor with an emotional family drama. It was to
~be'a mass entertainer and thought provoker finally, a script
that Will provide oppOrtunities to all my colleagues in the

Repertory Company to show their talent.
Mr. Josalkar, who is directing the play, was also
involved in this task, One day he casually asked "What

about Mahabhoj ?" "Nothing like that" was my instant
reaction, and} the serious discussion started on the possi-

bilities, in" terms of its big canvas and hUQe cast.
initially I thought of reducing its frame to suit our size.
But it would have been injustice to the original script.
Because it is not a play which revolves around a character

or a central idea, but it happens.

३ And it happened.
I में acknowledge the co-operation of Shri Vasant
Josalkar, Shri S. Y. Marathe, Shri G. R. Kale and Shri K. G.
Purohit.
