The first production of RANG MELL
the Repertory
Company -- is being staged today. The Repertory Company
was set up few months back, taking artists from amongst '
the graduates of the Kala Academy's School of Drama and
local talented artists. The Repertory Company is set up to
fulfill the long felt need to bring out the best amongst our
artists.
It is well known fact that Goan artists have shown their
capabilities in this field whenever given an opportunity.
Unfortunately, this has happened in the metropolitan cities
like Bombay and not at home. Today, we hope that the Kala
Academy will be able to throw out the best of talents in the
field of Drama from Goa itself.

Changes have taken place in the theatre as has been
in other spheres of life. With the change in Science and
Technology, new techniques have come about which have
been incorporated on the stage, thus making the performances more impressive and yet the performance has
become a complicated task. The Kala Academy has taken
up this challenge to prepare the professional artists in the
changing scenario.
