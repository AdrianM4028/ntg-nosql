from the stage of dramastisation and performed around 50
shows. The possibility that giving an entirely different
interpretation would harm the contents of the play, was a
major a doubt. Nevertheless, choice of the play remained
firm. Eventually we decided to go ahead with M ahabhoj and

Shri Suresh Marathe took the responsibility of adapting it.
T H E PRODUCTION

The entire team has been responsible for making this
production unique, and few stray reputations from the
original are, you can say my short comings. But one can't
even say they are short comings since when one is involved
in the National School of Drama, Repertory Company's
Production in the capacity as I did, things got justified and
it would be difficult for an alternative without effecting the
context.

The idea of "Natya Chitraankan". From the days of
Andhayug I have always encouraged my students to make
a collage related to the play. It was a good beginning so I
felt why not involve artistes to express the play in their
work. At the time of "Harnidabaichi Kothi" we initiated
discussions but still, some how.....

Now, we've tried to overcome our previous problems
and so, we have "Natya Chitraankan". The idea was to
exhibit the works of various artistes (centering round the
theme of play) depicting their view/impression of the script.
As this exhibition would be in the Foyer Area, the audience
would get a â€˜feel' of the play even before they enter the
audnonunm
This is a new mode of expression the culmination of
Visual and Performing Arts. The more response we get to
this the better will be the outcome.

So now we place before you this entire process that
we have put together thereby completing the production.
