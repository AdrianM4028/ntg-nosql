N ATYA C H l T RA N KA N
In response to this novel idea of involving the painters
in a theatrical performance, twenty six works were received
in the competition section. Out of these 26 works 5 have
been selected for the prize.

The idea is to exhibit all these works at the foyer of
theatre hall on the day of the performance of Gidhaad

Gatha. Thus, the spectators enter the hall with the impression in the mind created by these paintings.
Congratulations to prize winners and thanks to all the
participants. _
We are grateful to Smt. Prafulla Dahanukar and Shri
Shantaram Arnonkar for selecting the prize winning entries.
