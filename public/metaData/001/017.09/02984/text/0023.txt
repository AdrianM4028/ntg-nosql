N ATYA C H IT RA N KA N
A Meaningful Experiment
(H. V. Sharma)

It is a novel idea to ask artists other than theartical
performers or related artists to react to reading a playscript (in the present case "Gidhaad Gatha") and express
through their respective mediums, as artists are wont.

The purpose of presenting such variously expressed
reactions is not only to serve as exhibits in their own right
but also to persuade the spectators to assimilate the purport of the play through different mediums of expression
and share the experience before reacting to the play in
performance, directly.

Thus, the spectators as well as the non-performing
artists are expected to be doubly benefitted . At a different
level, the experiment attempts to bring together, the performers, non-performing artists, the onlookers and the
critics.

The expressions are in terms of colour, texture and
shape and a stray literary endeavour. One of the three
dimensional exhibits, expresses through just tactility.

The idea should carry and lead.
