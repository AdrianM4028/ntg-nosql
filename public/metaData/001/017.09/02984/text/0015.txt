GIDHAAD GATHA - IN PROGRESS
. Sonya d e S o u za

on the 16th October, 1992 we met for the first time.
Goa's Repertory Company - a rnotly crew of eighteen
members, differing widely in background but bound to-

gether by a fierce passion for theatre. None of us really
knew what to expect nor what exactly was expected of us.
But in due course of time we learnt and continue to learn.
The play was introduced to us in a few words. ‘A
mysterious death occurs in a village. No one knows how or
why. Improvise this scene'. Various interpretations were
expounded by the group and improvisation followed improvisation untill a scene vaguely resembling the present first
scene of the play evolved and various characters, only
slightly resembling those as we now know them, emerged.
And this is how the play unravelled itself to us. We
knew neither the name of the play nor had we seen the
script. Every day one scene was introduced to us which we
explored and experimented on. Characters from mere names
became real people acting and reacting idiosyncratically.
At the end of one month we had a full-blown play-dramatic

though still fluid and erratic.
Then came the script ‘ M ahabhoj' - adapted and translated from Hindi to Marathi by the chief of the Company, Mr.
G. S. Marathe. It was a hard battle with structured lines
after the free-flowing dialogue we had become used to. But
we had the advantage of knowing the play thoroughly

before reading the script and this prepared us for what was
expected of us. As we worked, the script itself changed face

and the play changed name-from ‘Mahabhoj' to Gidhaad
Gatha (Vulture's Story). When the play was cast, we had
characters we already knew well. The director of the play,

Mr. S. B. Josalkar, gave us the freedom to explore these
characters further and discover his/her actions and reac-

tions within the specified space. The set developed with the
play and properties were gradually introduced as per the
requirements of the characters.
