I am indeed happy to note that RANGKARMI RANGMANCH,

an institution. promoted to develop the artsistic talents in the ﬁelds of Dance,
Drama and Music, is celebrating its 2nd Annual Day function at Meerut
on 14 March 1981.

It is true that organisations of this kind can play an important
role in bringing up the talents and give encouragement to the young artists
in the said ﬁelds.
I take this opportunity to wish your organisation and the 2nd
Annual function the best of success.
