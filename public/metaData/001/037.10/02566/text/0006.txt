Director’s Note

One is prone to play-act in his actual life,
but mostly it leaves a sour taste and a sense of

remorse and guilt.

The main character of this

play, Vidya Sagar, is one such character who play-

acts in actual life and makes a fool of his friends
too. The web of plot slowly develops round the
machination of Vidya Sagar, who is basically an
honest man, but is not afraid to even tell a lie, if

it would relieve pain and suffering. A dishonest
act no more remains dishonest if it is for the good

of the people : that is the gist of his thinking.
The play gives the satisfaction of saving
people’s lives, giving them happiness, and relieving

them of misery through one’s creation.

Though

situations tend to border on naughtiness sometimes, they relieve one from the dull and drab
realities of life and make one laugh.
