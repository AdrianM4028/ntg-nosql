O u r Activities
“Youth of India” began with the publication of a monthly Journal in 1957. It
was brought out regularly for more than 7 years. Then, for some unavoidable reasons,
its publication was discontinued».
But the group of peOple bringing it out were instrumental in giving birth to a
registered society in 1962, which gave a new, wider dimension to the group’s activities.
It brought together young people interested in promoting cultural activities. In this
new phase we have so far presented various top-class programmes of dance, drama and
musrc.
Of late, in the ﬁeld of drama, we have done

tremendous work in

our own

enthusiastic and devoted manner since January 1966. Nine productions (with 27 shows)

have been staged since then and these have received a mixed sort of reception from
our critics and patrons. All this has given us a greater challenge to do better and much
bigger productions.
With Kaghaz-Ki-Deewar we venture into the language theatre with a lot of
hope to follow with better and more entertaining productions.

“Youth of India” is deeply grateful to its many advertising patron; without whose
most active, and signiﬁcant, support the tremendous achievement in so short a period
would have been quite a difﬁcult task.
