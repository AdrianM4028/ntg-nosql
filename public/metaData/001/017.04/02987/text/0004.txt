The production is based on the form of Jagar
but i have taken the liberty to present cultural and
artistic expressions of the said community. The
aboriginal style of presentation of the said form has

been maintained in the production without disturbing

its tradition and authenticity. While dramatising the
said story, artistic values of the said form and relati-

vity to contemporary

lndian

Theatre

has

been

untouched.

The dancing style used for this presentation is
not having any relation with any classical dance style
but the tradition which is developed in this form by
the Kunbi Gavda community and peculiar to the said
form has been maintained which could be defined
that the different characters participating in this form
are projecting themselves with traditional dance style
in relation to their characteristics of “Prakriti and,
Swabhava“. The monotony which is generally
prevailing in the various 'folk art forms has been
avoided by providing proper balance to the different

elements of production like the theme, dance, music
compositions, movements", stylisation, costumes etc.‘

with an incorporation of other relevant ritual and?
festival forms of the same cornmtrnity like Morulem,
Chawrang, Dhallo etc. At the time of’ selecting, the
costumes for the said production, it was felt nece—'
ssary to take into account the likeness and showness
of the particular tribal community as their habit is to

use bright

colours for their costumes, flowers

etc. The same are being used for different ritual and
other festival performances. At the same time, all
the above aspects of production have been confined
with the theatrical performances. The artistic levels

of ' tale" and “swara” have also been considered
along with the faiths and habits of the said commu—

nity. Though Jagar has been conceived as the major
form for production it is tried here to project the
cultural life and traditional expressions of the said

com m u n ity .
