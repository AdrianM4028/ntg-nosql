daughter of Kama Deva. As Sraddha conquers
the darkness of eternal night,
Manu sows the civilizing seeds of light in the
wilderness of chaos
The ﬁrst
prom—historical civi

lization is established. But, as Sraddha is lost
in the eager
anticipation of the fulfilment-s of motherhood, Man

and deprivatio

n. His rebellious individuality recoi
solicitude of Sraddha, and Mann abandons her and is ls against the self—effacing
himself cast adrift in endless
wanderlust.

Prajna and 'render‘ his kingdom into a th‘ingdom obedient
to the absolutism of his
own selfhood. Indespotic precipitancy he. brings
