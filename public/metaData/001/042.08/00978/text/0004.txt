About the Project :
This Play is a part of my one year fellowship project with the National
School of Drama. The subject of my study is “Method Acting”, its development and possibility of its implementation in l ndia n films and theatre. For the
past one year, l have been studying the history of modern acting as well as
method acting and other genere of modern acting, and have also discussed
with several film and theatre actors and directors in India and England about
the same. Till now, I had studied about the theoritical aspect of Method

Acting, but in this play, l have tried to implement its practical aspect. Theory
and practice, are two sides of the same coin, but, when it comes to practice,

preseverance and hard work are the key of actors. I accept, that the
techniques I am practicing in this exercise are imperative for the primay
stage of using this genre of acting.
