I was happily surprised to learn that AN U RAG has not only survived so many years but
is ﬂourishing enough to celebrate the fact by bringing out an exhaustive souvenir.
It is good of you to ask for my best wishes.
What shall I wish in a country and a Society where neither the governments nor rich
philanthropers recognise the great art and the best medium of Enlightement that the the theatre is ?

In a democratic society theatre combines in itself both the government and the opposition, by showing the right path without recourse to a penal code and by pointing out defects with
sympathy and without bitterness.
And what is the condition of Indian theatre is our country ‘2 The professional one does not

exist on the whole; the Ameteur one is not only chaotic and unorganised but is largely in Indian.

Though the Indian Theatre is one, the one-ness is not recoginsed because of the Inaya of a miltiplicity of languages.

After 50 years involvement in it the best I can wish is may Indian theatre be re-established
in Indian soil, if not in my life time, at least in the time of our children and grand children.

May ANURAG serve the cause long and effectively.
