Vande - Matar'am

I bow to thee, Mother
richly-watered richly-fruited
cool with the winds of the South
Dark with the crops of the harvests
The Mother.
Her nights rejoining in the glory of the moonlight
her lands clotheg beautifully with her trees
in flowering bloom
Sweet of langther,
sweet of speech
the Mother; giver of boons giver of bliss.
