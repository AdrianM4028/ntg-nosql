Mariana, located in tha temple city
of Bhubaneswar has never looked back
since its inception in 1980. It was created by a group of devoted theatre
workers with the objective to revive
and rejuvenate the culture of theatre in
the state which is fast degenerating due
to heavy onslaughts of cinema and
video. Mariana has to its credit a number
of significant productions many of
which have won accolades in various

Drama Competitions. The team strives
to project the plight of the common man
in general and the middle class peOple
in perticular through its plays and
believe in identifying with their problems. The rich traditional culture of
Orissa and its folk style are mostly
depicted in its plays. Manan has been
persistently keeping pace with the dayto day deveIOpments in the world of
theatre

and has been using various

forms of performing arts not only with
the aim of upholding the rich cultural

heritage of the state but also to pOpularising them as and when the sequences
in the plays so demand. “To add to its
credit Manan has not only contributed
to the theatre field of the state a band of
prospective actors and actresses rather
its contribution as regards several praisevvorthy
directors and back-stage
artites is also commendable. Manan’s
long cherished dream is to dedicate
itself to the cause of enriching the
theatre movement of the state and to
promote
socio-cultural
awakening
among the masses.‘
