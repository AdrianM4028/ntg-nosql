Mukunda Lal Choudhury in his “Manipur Itihash” written immediately

among the national heroes of India. Fortunately the Government of India
accepted the suggestion of Sri Arun Chandra Guha, to include the portrait
of "Bir 'I‘ikendrajit” in the National Portrait Gallery inside the House of
the People in New Delhi."
