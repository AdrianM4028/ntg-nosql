ABOUT THE ACTING GROUP
Padatik has started an acting training course of
one year from May ’96 under the guidance of its
DireCtor Sri Shyamanand Jalan.

The purpose of introducing such course is to prepare the students for acting on stage, TV, and ﬁlm.
Our method of training is production oriented, so
that the students can get lessons in all aspects of
drama. This is a part time course of 3 classess of
2 hours each in a week supervised by a group of 5

teachers having graduate or post graduate degree
in drama from Rabindra Bharati University. They
are Biplanu Maitra, Arindam Mukherjee, Kaustav

Dutta Gupta and Mainul Haque with Debasish
Sinha the Convenor. Another purpose of the
GrOUp is to make the students of all other arts
and the basic principles of arts appreciation and
engagement.
All the students may not become
theatre artists or technicians, most of them will
not but at least they will have a better understanding and capability of enjoying the arts.
These productions present the work of this Acting
GrOUp presenting two of the signiﬁcant works done
by the students.
