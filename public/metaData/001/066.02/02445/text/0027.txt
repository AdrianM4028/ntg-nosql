leaving aside the rational reasoning and enjoying the

without letting it dry with dust analysis and the post

critique" .

grown with the passage of the time, had questioned the
existence of God, turned agnostic and yet mysteriously
in times of crisis had recalled Rama's name. What mother
had told to take recourse to His will, reconcile to the
events on which we had no control, and not loose what
the Hindus call astha, the faith in Him, we dwelt upon it

all, watching the recording, and discussing the finer
aspects of the epic for the stage presentation.

The production traverses between the narration of the
story with the Sutradhara, who like a modern day
Kathakar like Moraribapu, or Panduranga Shastri tells the
story of Rama, bringing within its gamut the day to day
life, events the way changes take place, the effect of the
idoit box, how it controls our lives involuntarily, the
crass commercialism, the political scenario, which none

persona, Chetana had indeed brought to bear upon the
evolving theatre the richness of Kathak.
In her use of the tihais, the arnads, the old bandishes,

the kavits, the tatkar, both in the passages that offered
the criticism and those which carried on the story
further, Chetana was using Kathak with which she is
familiar since she executed her first steps in dance. It
was indeed quite fascinating to see her use the salami
todas of salutation, as it used to be performed thirty
years ago, before the great maestro Birju Maharaj opened
our eyes to the lyrical beauty of offering salarn in the
Mughal court. Prior to that it was Ramanarayan-ji’s style
taught in succession to an entire generation of young
dancers in Calcutta, throwing limbs in all directions, but
in tala, coming pat on the sam, often touching the

ground, making sarnyukta hastas of pushpanjali and
standing in a gwaky, awkward position, with the
innocence of a young entrant to the world of sound and
fury, whirling chakkars at a breakneck speed, beauty of
movements be damned so far as you end on an exact
note of sam! It has the colour of nostalgia, but Chetana
has used it with a charming sensitivity, appropriate to
the sequence.

of us can escape, the critique of it and linking it with the
events in the life of Rama, the progression of the story in
genres that range from classical Kathak to the Parsi
theatre, realistic presentation, to the higly natyadharmi,
the stylized mode, exploring the ekaharya lasyanga
principle of the Natyashastra, in which one dancer/actor

narrates the story, irnprovises and makes it rich. Like a
padarn employed for exposition of the abhinaya,
resorting to all the conventions of the sthayi, bhava,
anubhavas, alambana, uddipana vibhava and the sanchari
bhavas, freely employing at the same time lokadharrni
mode and weaving in a rich tapestry of emotions and
sentiments resulting in the Rasa. At times, reminding us
of the uparupaka tradition, resorting to anekaharya
lasyangas, each character playing a different role, some
times using a prop to turn into different character. The
convention of using chitrabhinaya, holding real bow,
putting a scarf in a different manner on the shoulder, or
round the head to indicate another character, turning
with a palta, as in gatbhava and portraying another

punctuation marks of the Rasa, the flavour.
