CHE'I‘NA JALAN blends in her work all the unique
qualities of a renowned Kathak exponent, an innovative
choreographer capable of fusing different styles, as well
as a noted actress of serious plays. Currently Director of
the Padatik Dance Centre, she received her formal

training in Kathak from the most renowned gurus of the
Lucknow Gharana, Pandit Ram Narayan Mishra, Pandit
Birju Maharaj and Pandit Vijai Shankar.

Chetna's mastery over Kathak and her innate
understanding of other dance forms resulted in her
selection as a jury member for the International Ballet
Competition twice: in Moscow in 1985 8: 1987, and in
Jackson Mississippi in 1994. She has attended the
International Dance Symposium in Seoul in 1991 to
dance and hold lecture-demonstrations. Her performances
have been critically acclaimed in India and abroad.
Famed for her “abhinaya”, Chetna Jalan's inherent acting
talent received formal discipline at the American
Conservatory Theatre, San Franscisco, and in Stanford
University, where she did a course in Mass Media in
1969-70. Thereafter she was a teacher in the Ustad Ali
Akbar's music college in San Francisco for a year.

Rarnkatha is a subject very close to Chetna Jalan’s heart.
In this production she combines her histrionic capabilities
with her dancing talent to present a choreography that
explores form, content and narrative technique in a way
that has been seldom attempted in India.
SHYAMANAND JALAN has been associated with the

modern theatre movement in India for nearly four
