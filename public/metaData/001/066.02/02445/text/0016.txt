: As a director aware of various performing
traditions how did you and Chetna go
about? What inspired you to handle the
theme without any script in view?

S hya m

: The immediate impact was say the
hypnotic and theuraputic effect of
Namasankirtan, the collective prayer
repeating the name of Rama. That total
surrender, the feeling of believing in some
one made me sit up. Can a director
explore the possibilities of employing
these resources, use the simple rhythm of
Kathak for conveying simple mood and
dramatic situations. I also have been
toying with an idea of seeing how pop
music which has such a tremendous hold
on the masses, and can be used in a

production like this? And most importantly
what is there in Murari Bapu and other
saints which holds people for days and
weeks listening to the story of Rama and
use the elements in Ramkatha.

immediate relevance and validity?

S hya m

: I have been watching Kathak. Is it only for
the virtuosity, taiyyari, showing off the
command over the technique and winning
rounds of applause — or there is something
more to it for its artistic use say in a
theatre production? We started the work in
