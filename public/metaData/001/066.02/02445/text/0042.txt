the society through this procession Fifty years ago there
used to be tableauxs on Crime-murder, gambling,
hoarding, robbery, prostitution, addictions etc, But now

under the influence of the reformist movement the
‘Vulger’ and ‘Obscene’ have been eliminated and we
have excellent religious tableauxs with fine craftrnanship.
Lakhs of people visit Chetganj Nakkatiya to see beautiful
‘Lags‘ 8: ‘Vimans‘. Thus the ugly face of the society is at
present hidden under the ‘reform‘ masks and the
purpose of the originators is lost.

Nakkataiya procession has an attractive and thrilling
feature — the display of martial arts. A number of
experts do the Kali or Durga masks and brandish swords
amongst the milling crowds in very narrow lanes. There
are throaty shouts “allow space, beware, save yourself”
and the crowd makes room for the majestic gladiators

escape; and never any accident has been reported. Only
for this one display, the procession is worth visiting.
