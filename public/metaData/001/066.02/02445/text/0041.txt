The
Hindi. Of course there is no standard text of dislogues
except at Ramnagar where the dialogues were written
(from RCM and other works of Tulsi). Some Rarnlila ‘
groups use the work of other poets and in their extreme
enthuiasrn make the character repeat the same speech in
Sanskrit, RCM, other poems of Tulsi and other poets,
Urdu Shairee and some times modern hybrid Hindi +
English dialogue. Some directors are poets and their
works are included in the speech.

the Chariots, paper animals like Jatayu, Rat, Swan, Bull,
the great snake bed, the great bow of Shiva, and Lanka
(to be burnt). One can compare these with the craft of
Tazia making (Muslim festival of Moharrarn). Great Shiva
bow is carefully made and when Ram presses the lever it
breaks in three pieces.

12. Light & Sound
Traditional Rarnlilas (Ramnagar, Chitrakut) do not

use Microphones or Spot Lights. Mashals (Torches), Gas
lamps and at places a high voltage flood light lamp serve
the purpose. The style of dialogue delivery in loud shrill
voice makes the sound magnification unnecessary.

13. Music & Recitation

Elocution is lyrical, with special accent and stresses. The
acting is stylized. The actors behave in their roles and
there is a sort of self hypnosis which endows them with
super human power.
This style of acting and dialogue was probably
developed keeping in view the illiterate masses who
keep on talking to each other. In between the dialogues
either people talk shop or devotees recite Ramayana.
Thus they have time to think and digest the words of the
speech while lazily enjoying the show.
Though many of Rarnlila groups have adopted Parsi
theatre or Nautanki style of acting highly melodramatic
and emotionally surcharged but in true Rarnlila there is
no stress on acting, only the words are to be spoken.
But the effect is magical, both on the audience and the
actor. We have seen people weeping with Ram when he
wails over unconscious Lakshman. Rarnlila needs no loud
speakers because everyone knoWs the story and the
physical senses are hardly needed to participate in the
play. Rarnlila is said to be a commentary of RCM for
common people and they understand the meaning as
they feel or deserve ( Jako jahan arth hai jaiso; Lila lalit
lakhwati taiso.) RCM chorus provides descriptions,
philosophical comments and deeper thoughts.

Rarnlila has no Music or Dance. The RCM is recited
in chorus in the ‘Naradbani' styles, in which they add
He-Ha before every chaupai. There is no stress on the
correctness of Musical notes and the time beats are
simple. Ramayani’s recite every line of RCM and
incidents capable of being enacted are performed. Often
there are two groups of Ramayanis (RCM recitors) and
there is a keen competition and they recite lustily in
high pitched rancous voice. The recitation is done in
Torch lights which throws an amber sheen on the faces
of Ramayanis. The chorus uses Drums (Dhol),Cymbals
(Ihanj and Majeera), Kartal, Chirnta and some groups use
Harrnoniurn & Tabla.

Some groups include a programme of classical Dance

Rarnlila is a performance without curtains and there
is nothing behind the stage, everything is done in open.
The sets are not influenced by modern western drama.
The craftsmen (both Hindu & Muslim) prepare with the
help of Bamboo and newspaper sheets or coloured
papers the effigies of great demons, the gates of Lanka,
