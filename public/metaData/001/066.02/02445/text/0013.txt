Dealing with the literary sourcesI have made certain

inprovisations. To make Tulsi understandable I picked
up similar poems from “Bharatendu” and others. I have
tried to bring about a blend between traditional Tulsidas
lines and poems from Lok—Shaili, and even Urdu poetry.

In the Dhanush Yagna, I have modelled on the style on
“Sharma Bandhu". This particular style of narration of the
Rarncharitrnanas moved me and with this I introduced
my own improvisation : When the dhanush is brought to
the Raj durbar I have used tatkars ; dhe dhe te te tak ta/
dhe dhe te te, dhe dhe tete dhe dhe te te tak ta/. To
bring in some comic relief I devised two tukdas based
on the traditional Paran of Sitara Devi. I have tried to
incorporate the bols of Kathak with the action and
dialogue.

Ramkatha liberated me from being in a strict classical
formatAs a dancer-choreographer I could traverse front
complex classical patterns and tihais to the popular
modes, judiciously and intuitively enriching the form
with contemporary sensibilities, extending the artistic
horizons. At the same time I never lost sight and pursuit
of Rasa — the flavour. the relish.
Not to end on negation, as per the Hindu and Indian
convention, after the Sutradhara's address at the end, we

have brought in celebration, emphasising the need for
astha, the faith. The swarupas, the idols are brought, the

rituals are performed and prayers are offered building up
a mood that may lead us to regain the loss of faith.
