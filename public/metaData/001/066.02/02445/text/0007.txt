Do I believe in God ‘? This is a question I have often asked myself. Though there is no clear
answer, yet I have a vague feeling that I do. Not in Rama or Krishna or Vishnu or Shiva, but in
an unknown force which controls us. I know I am not a sovereign entity. And since I do not know
who or what controls me, why be desperate about it or why lose the will to live the life which I
must? Why not assume that I am sovereign, responsible for my own actions and destiny. Yet,
have a belief to sustain me during adversity that what will be, will be and I do not really have the
power to change it. I have the consciousness of this life time and I know what I like and I don’t,
what hurts me and what pleases me. I should do that which makes me happy, or which I think
will make me happy and leave the results on the fate, on that mysterious force, on that God.
But I wish I did believe in Rama, that I did love him, that I had faith in him. This would have

made life simpler. Then it would be natural to emulate him and acquire justice, love, sense of duty
and fairplay and all other virtues which he symbolises; instead of acquiring them as practical tools
for happpy existence. It would have brought harmony in life.

My mother tried to make me believe in Rama. Though she did not succeed, yet in moments of
depression, fear and despondence I repeat the name again and again within myself, just as she
had taught. And somewhere, deep inside I feel that it will help me in tiding over the difficulties.
And strangely, it in fact does. How or why, I do not know. But surely it does.
