The lanes connecting the platforms are the streams of
lila, this mortal world, where the entire illusory ‘lila’ goes
on. Every one tries to achieve salvation or final
emancipation and one can cross these lanes to reach the
Divine stage through knowledge, Devotion and good
ethical deeds. Ram represents Truth and Justice (North
Stage) while Ravan is evil and unjust and the war of
‘Dharma’ is fought in this lane which represents this life.
Technically the Tulsi Manch provides:

long drawn monosyllabic dialogues followed by throaty
hails from the audience. Add to this picture the busy
directors (Vyasji), prompters, managers and all the crew
which in modern drama is supposed to be behind the
stage (here there is nothing hidden) and then the
entire arrangement appears to be magnificient, multidimensional, sterophonic, cinemascopic, a ‘Total’

‘Intimate Theatre’
7.

1)

Costumes

Very close rapport with the audience.

2)

Different levels break the monotony.

3)

Beautiful grouping of actors on all sides.

4)

Colourful patterns.

5) Just like old Indian Paintings we have here visually
pleasing juxtaposition of different scenes at optically
different levels.
When you see the stage in. action it appears as if you

are floating on a sea of human beings in which there
are raised islands and on them you can see through

dim lights of evening Gods with golden crowns or the
hydra headed Demons. And to all this you add the
chorus, the sound of Drums and Cymbals, the shrill

Ramlila uses multicoloured, gaudy consumes with
golden and silver embroidery. Varanasi is famous for its
Zari work. At present Goat and Kalabattu have been
replaced by shiny nylon; Karnkhwab has given place to
synthetic dress material.

In Ramlila the Divine characters put on yellow dhotis or
red velvet or golden dresses with zariwork. Monkeys put
on red, green yellow or blue frilled skirts and paijamas.

Demons put on dark blue or black dresses. Ravan has a
grand navy blue zari coat which is artistic, attractive and

beautiful; it matches with his equally majestic mask. Sita
puts on beautiful Benarasi Saree, while other females
(Always played by men or eunuchs) wear or wrap

themselves in ordinary cotton sarees.
