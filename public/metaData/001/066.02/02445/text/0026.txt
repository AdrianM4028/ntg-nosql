I had returned to Calcutta after a long tour of the South
East Asia after nearly eight months. On arrival I called
on Shyamanand and Chetna. Both were in the middle of
the rehearshal of their latest production Rarnkatha/
Rarnkahani to be staged for four evenings from 25rd
November (1995). Since I was high on what I had
witnessed at Prambanan temple near Yogyakarta, Java, in
the open-air performance on the full moonlight of
Sharad Chandrika, barely three weeks ago, the topic
gravitated towards the Pam Asian tradition of our "Indian
epic” the Ramayana.

of view of a theatre director, examining the Natyashastra

principles, testing the Rasa theory, contrasting it with the
Stanislavasky and the Western theatre, its aesthetics and
what have you, the work-in-progress production became
very exciting.

Last year in December I was invited to read a paper
during the 11th International Seminar on Ramayana at
Tharnrnasat University, Bangkok, Thailand. From Calcutta
Sushrnita Banerjee, a Kathak disciple of Vijay Shankar
had accompanied me to present in a solo format the
sequences from 'I'ulsidas' Shri Rarncharitmanas. One can
easily come under the spell of the wonderful chaupais of
this literary work of great poetic beauty and significance.
It had acted as a catalystic agent for me to read Shri
Ramcharitrnanas again. It is impossible for any Indian
brought up in a traditional middle class family, where
rituals are a part of one's life, where the parents perform
puja and worship the gods, be they Rama, Shiva or
Krishna, not to have the sarnskaras of having listened to
Tulasidas' chaupais. Both Sushrnita and I had worked
together selecting the appropriate chaupais for the
presentation in a solo Kathak format at the National
Theatre at Bangkok, prior to the presentation of the

With the staggering variety and plural vocabulory of
dance movements, the manner in which the story of
Ramayana has found felicitous expressions in both the
plastic and the performing arts, in India and Asia, one

could only marvel at the resilience of the dance and
theatre forms, the overlapping of the forms, the literary
content, the musical modes, the recall to the childhood
memories, the indelible impressions one has gathered

over the years, a continous exposure to the
performances, presentations across the vast geographical
areas not only of India but also of Asia and the time
span, the way the same theme poses several challenges
to a theatre director, a solo dancer and a choreographer
and a Rasika, a connoisseur — the encounter has been

fascinating and rewarding.

I remember my mother used to say that to delve deep
into Shri Rarncharitrnanas is like taking a dip in to the
holy Ganges — Gangasnana. When Shyarnanand, Chetna
and I were engaged in a tripartite conversation on how

traditional Khon, the mask dance-drama of Thailand

based on Rarnakien (Ramakhyana) as the Ramayana is
known in Thailand.

the Ramkatha came about I experienced the truth of
what mother had said. The evening was punctuated with
what two of them had gone through creating the

For the past three years Chetna and Shyarnanand had
been toying with the idea of presenting the Ramayana as
Ramakatha in a form that would share the sensibilities of
a theatre director, cosanguine with that of the Kathak
dancer / choreographer. Chetna was making frequent
visits to Benaras and other parts of UP. to look at the
traditions of the Ramayana and gathering material . She
had by this time collected an unrnanagable mass of

Rarnakatha, the screening of the video of the work-in-

progress production and our individual and collective

responses, sharing the eternal appeal of the epic,
subduing the rational beings in each one of us, and
letting one go and “fall under the spell' of the epic,
