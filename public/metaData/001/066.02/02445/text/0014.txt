sitting in high places and on branches of trees would fall down and break their limbs. Rama
advised them to keep their eyes and ears shut and to hold on to the ground. But some
people took Rama's warning too lighly and suffered the consequences. Rama relented, saying
that those who had wilfully ignored his warning would remain handicapped all their lives,
but the other would be cured. This is the reason why there are lame, blind and deaf people
on earth.

Ram Katha in Tribal groups of Rajasthan — It is a belief among people that if the ruler
himself ploughs the land, drought will be averted. In the land of Janaka there was a
continuous spell of drought. The tribals prevailed over their ruler to cultivate the land, and
the latter obliged. during ploughing, the outer edge of the plough touched a human body in
the earth and Sita, daughter of Janaka, was born. The tribal Ramayana also explains the
emergence of Sita by saying that tribal victims of drought threw their live children into the
fields. Sita was one such dispossed child.

Ram Katha among the Tribes of India — \then Ravana carried away Sita, Rama fought against
him and killed him and his companions. Only one of Ravana's attendants was still left. He
fell at Rama's feet and said: "It is good that you have killed. all the others but at least let me
live and let my friend come to life.” Rama threw the water of life over his friend who was
lying dead nearby and brought him alive. Rama said, "Well, I will spare both of you; but
now run away quickly for Lakshmana is coming and he will be less merciful. He will kill
you." They said : "But we are not strong enough to run quickly. Lakshmana will surely kill
us." So Rama in his mercy gave them wings. The attendant became a parrot and his friend a
kite; they rose into the air and escaped. This is why the parrot learns how to say "Rama
Rama" so quickly.
