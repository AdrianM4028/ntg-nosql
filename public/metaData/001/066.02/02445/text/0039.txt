leaves (Tulsi Mala). Then there are usual ornaments like
necklaces, bracelets, mekhla (waist bands), anklets (for

sita), ear rings etc. In Chitrakut a different Mukut
(Crown) is used for every performance. During the exile
episodes the swaroops wear a crown but a black tape is
tied across it to symbolise the cancellation of the waist.
They carry bow and arrows, the arrow case is tied on
the back. The Mukut (crown) used for the Coronation
episode is gorgeous and a Tej kiran is added to it which
created the semblences of auraw. The monkeys carry
wooden clubs (Gada) and demons have swords and
shields. Parashuram carries an axe (Pharsa).

then the masks or Orissa, Chau dance, Shri Lanka masks,
Kathakali and Yaksha gaan masks, A search for the

Rarnlila uses at least 22 masks. These are made of Papier
mache, metal and cloth.

A)

Papier. mache masks are of I-Divine group. Shiva,

Ganesh, Brahma,Cow (Earth), Garud, Kak Bhushundi, II-

Monkeys — Hanuman, Sugriva, Angad, Nal, Neel,
Jamvant, other monkeys,Deer, III- Demon group — Ravan,
Kumbhkarna, Meghnad, Khardhushan, Marich,

Surpanakha, Tadka other demons.
B)

Metal Masks are of Kali, Durga, Hanuman ( a

speciality of Varanasi Ramlila, where the golden face of
the great monkey is presented through a shining brass
mask with a golden crown tied over it). The Kali and
Durga masks are huge and gorgeous, the face is Brass,
covered alround by a metal sheet with braziers—eraft
manship and decoration with peacock feathers and
coloured threads and wires. Some Rarnlilas use a huge
donkey mask of brass for Khardhushan. These masks are
heavy and venerated. The Hanuman mask at Ramnagar
weight 14 pounds. These masks are worshipped and then
worn especially the Kali-Durga masks are ‘lifted’ by the
experts of Martial arts. Kali-Durga characters symbolise
war and they wear armours ( of wire nets) carry sword,
axe, shield, bowls (for Blood), artifitial demon heads.

Richer the Ramlila group costlier the masks.
