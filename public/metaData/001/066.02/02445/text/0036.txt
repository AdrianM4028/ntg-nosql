many features in common with ‘Ramlila’.

As to the antiquity of Rarnlila in Varanasi, we know that
Chitrakirt Rarnlila was there in 1543 AD (RCM was written
in 1574 AD) as is accepted in an Allahabad High Court
Judgement of 1908 (Allahabad Law Journal 1918 page
529-545). Here the judgement says ‘Ramlila is a religious
procession in which people worship historical charactors.
This lila is going on from the time of Meghabhagat who
was present in Sarnvat 1600). We also have the wills of
Mehants of Tulsidas Akhara which are more than 200
years old and where in they instruct the successors about
the management of Lilas. James Princep mentions that
the Ramlila was performed here in Varanasi even before

1675 AD. We have very beautiful sketches of Nati Imli
Bharat Milap done by Princep in 1825. The tradition of
religious prosessions is very old. One more historical
event may be narrated here to bring out the glory of
Ramlila. In the year 1811 AD as usual Chitrakut Ramlila
was being performed when Bishop Macpherson objected
to it and said that Hanuman in RCM jumped across the
ocean, can this Hanuman jump across the River Varuna
(27 Cubit wide); if he can not, we will ban the

performance. And the Hanuman with the permission of
Ram did jump across the ﬂooded river. Even to day the
monument of Tekrarn Bhatta’s mask and a temple of
Hanuman is there to commemorate the event.

We do not know what was the form of Ramlila before
Tulsidas probably it was based on Valrniki Rarnayan or
on Hanuman Natak. We do know that Ramlilas were
performed before Tulsidas at Chitrakut (Banda) and at
Ayodhya, but for reasons unknown these performances
have become obsolete, only in Varanasi Lila continues
unhindered; and it its true traditional form at Chitrakut

(Varanasi).

5. Types of Rarnlilas in Varanasi
We have at least three types of Ramlilas in Varanasi.
a) Chitrakut Ramlila b) Tulsi‘s Assighat Ramlila
c) Rarnnagar Ramlila.

favourite God), it is the 'darshan of God resident in an
image of flesh. You can call ’Jhanki' - a dumb show or a
mute spectacle, a ‘Tableaux vis'antes', A Jhanki does not .

truly enact any narrative. but the divine images remain in
their seats for more than an hour. with coloured ﬂares

making the tableaux more colourful. Jhanki is a
performance for the idol-ss'orshipping devotees especially
the Vaishnavas who have similar traditions in their

temples.

This technique of Lila is associated with Mahaprabhu
Vallabhacharya, Roop & Jive Goswarni .‘viegha Bhagat
and other great Vaishnava saints.

B)

Tulsi Ramlila — is the type of performance which

one can see everywhere in Varanasi. Of these the most

important one is the Rarnlila of Assi. (The oldest records
are of 1680). It is also probably four hundred year old if
we are to believe ‘Gautarn Chartdrﬁa' - an old
manuscript which describes the Coronation Lila at Assi
Ghat performed bv Tulsidas himself. The present group
was registered1n 1935. Originally 15551 Ramliia v.as a 16
day serial performance but no“ they have added two
more performances. Other lilas of this paaern are of
seven to thirtv dav duration The main features of this
type are its stage design the dialog:aes. recitations.
multiple locations rituaLs. adomatiorts and the
processions.
