Rama has been an integral part of Indian life. Over the
centuries, He has been the symbol of religion and purity
to all Indians, irrespective of caste and creed. He has
personified our capacity to love and inspired us to
follow the path of truth and justice. He has been our
support in distress. And yet we have severely wounded
Him in the last few decades.

When the Mughal empire took roots in India, Tulsidas
redefined the story of Rama and popularised it among
masses, to give the people a sense of security and
mental peace. The story has been told and retold in
many ways and forms, through various arts and has
given emotional sustenance to many. The saga of Ram
has been one of the most popular through the ages.

The contemporary socio—political scene has created a
sense of acute distress in the humanity. With the
advance of science and technology, the sense of
insecurity, fear and distress is increasing and resulting
into violence from all sides. All the cherished values
providing solid anchor to man have been disternpered.
Love, truth, justice and honesty have become empty
hollow words today.

faith in something, say Rama, and the values he
