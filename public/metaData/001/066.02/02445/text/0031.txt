Kechaka and the Ramayana at various centres in
Indonesia. For the tourists they are mounted so tastefully
and at Ubud at the palace temple with excellent
arnbience that it invariably casts a spell on the
audiences. As a living tradition the Ramayana is popular
and there is a political will to keep it, as the epic is so
popular amongst the masses. Of course, there are
stylistic differences in the Palace traditions and those of
the other institutions. The musical accompaniment of the
garnelan lends special charm as do the colourful
costumes and overall aesthetic presentation.
At Yogyakarta at the Sultan’s palace on every Sunday
morning incidents from the Mahabharata are also
presented. The most popular is Arjuna vivaha. The
articulation of the limbs of the body has much in
common with the puppet tradition. Highly aesthetic in
movements, costumes and music, it is a treat to watch
these performances. Not far from Jogyakarta is Surakarta5010 where too the tradition of the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata at the Sultan’s Palace is presented tastefully.

strong Buddhistic elements. The story is divided in two
parts. The first, after the usual formula of a Buddhist
jataka or Buddha's birth story, purports to give the
history of the common ancestors of the story’s hero and
the villain. A number of interesting details in the Rama
Jataka differ from those in the Ramayana of India and
Rarnakien of Thailand. It also differs from the South
Asian and South East Asian versions. These represent
attempts at localization or embellishment, particularly in
non-literary folk versions, or the free usages of the epic
material in traditional theatre performances.
Next door in Burma, the tradition of Ramayana is also a
living tradition, despite the Buddhist religion. The literary
work from Burma is known as The Rama Thagyin,
written by U Aung Phyo in 1775. The Rama Yagan
written by U Toe is most famous and popular amongst
the masses. In 1800 another version of the Ramayana as
Kalai Rama appeared. Among all the works the
Mahararna of the 20th century makes departure from the
earlier works. It introduces the episode of Gombadipa
carrying away Rama to the under world of the Yakkhini
who transforms herself as dead Sita to deceive Rama. It
also introduces second banishment of Sita for having
drawn a portarit of Ravana on a fan. Also it has a
version where Rama in the end enters Sarayu river. This
version is also not known in India.

In Malayasia two versions of the Ramayana used for the
shadow plays are known as Hikayat Seri Rama and
