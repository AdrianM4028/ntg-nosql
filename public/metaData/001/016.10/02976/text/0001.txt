Director's note:——
In the play 'Velliyazhcha', l have tried to
build up a dramatic structure from a fable. The story
is that
of a devil who assumes charge as a vicar in a village parish
,
Puthanachan, the new priest, starts influencing the local people

until they themselves turn devils.

‘

The play is in four acts. In the first act,

the

devil,

after

killing a priest who was to assume charge in the church
,
encounters the angels of God and justifies his existence. He
pronounces what he is going to do-——he will pollute lands,
rivers and minds. He prevents people from passing ethical

judgements on others and calls upon them not to

be

serious

about confession, as man may not get leisure for it after a day’s
hard work.
In the second act, the devil-priest tackles Mariamma, .a
village maid. She waits for her lover and turns away rich
travellers who want to exploit her poverty and loneliness.
Puthanachan tempts her to the path of sin until she is iost in her
biological urges and monetory motives. The metaphor of the
tree is used in this act to bring out how nature is corrupted
by the knowledge of modernisation.
The third act brings the situation to a climax. Here two
characters, Andipilla and Chembanmudi, who have become rich
and powerful- by the direction of the priest, are on a hunt for
sandalwood and tribal women. One of the women, Thevi, is
chased and she seeks shelter in the church. The priest leads her
to an inner room in the church. When the two powerful men
come to the church and tell him how they lost a woman in the
woods, the priest asks them to go to the room. The woman is

raped in the comforts of the

church.

Then Puthanachan

hears

an oracle that the eighth son of this woman would kill him.
The devil-priest replies that he will put to death all the male
children of the parish.
