Mariamma dances

out violence

and death and

is

carried

away by the devil. The people are left to themselves. Varkey
shrieks calling the devil-priest; he cannot exist without a guidling devil. Andipilla, the most powerful man who wields political
and monetary power transforms himself into a devil. Others
become devils in no time and they pursue Thevan, Thevi and
the living Christ. Thevan, who embodies the living Christ faces
the devils when the play ends.

The puppet motif that runs through the play is structured
in the theme. Characters are conceived as guided by forces
beyond their control. The debate between good and evil is
linked up with this conception of characters in the play.

Paintings, masks and puppets are used to serve functions
according to various levels of meaning that the play is intended
to communicate.

Traditional theatre of various types is used as part of the
and
general stylisation of the play. Movements, voices, . chants
sources; bUt they are
are adapted from traditional
rhythms
tic
controlled from the perspective of dramatic unity and thema
development.
