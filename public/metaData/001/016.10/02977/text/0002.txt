once prevailed in Kerala. Although it is
not a period — play, the ancient ethos is sought
to be maintained in the script as well as the
production. It is my attempt to Create out of a
localised myth a play on the predicament of man

in the context of modern India.
'Souparnika' is the name
of a yakshi who was brought
into being from a 'Kalam' painting
done by a casteless artiste in exile, and
so she embodies the dream of the exileShe spells horror and burns the

menfolk of the village in the flames of
her passion;

towards the end

of the play

she is

almost an earthly being, identified with the
ways of human life, but, reduced to an exile.

Souparnika experience; human
love from Venmoni, a Narnboodiri
(Kerala Brahmin) youth who is a half
wit and a butt of redicule among his
friends. Souparnika's visits arouse his faculties to full bloom. But then, the youth falls
into a dualistic life—a life between earthly
convention on one side and the celestial ideal
on the other. Souparnika too finds herself between

two worlds. She wants to
be human, but her lover wants
to defy the limits of his human existence
and to become a 'Gandharva'. Souparnika
accepts the

limits of freedom for his sake,

and, with her sanction the rebel surrenders
to the rigid laws and custom.
Souparnika's motherly
instincts complete the process
of her hurnanisation. She had
persuaded Venmoni to many from

his own caste, and pleaded for
the neglected wile; but now motherhood is her overwhelming passion,
for physically she cannot become a
mother. This brings her to a tragic encounter
with the convention of the time.

In

the production, I have tried to

discoxe: a diffe-ent style of theatre in
Maiayalarn. Instead of picking up elements
from traditional theatre forms and fusing them,
I

have tried to evolve the mood and the inner
landscape of the play by means
of suggestions associated with

traditional theatre. Elements of music,
dance

and ritual are never

allowed to distract

the spectator from the totality

only in so far as they contribute

to the innner structure by externalising psychological
and philosophical situations.
scenes which are apparently realistic

are structured to be fused in to the
general orchestration of 'Vachika' and
the total pattern of 'Angika’. This is to
prevent the inner w0r|d of characters form being over
shadowed by uninvolved physicalisation and external

music. A word about the traditional
elements which have functioned
as sources for the style of production.
As for ’Vachika', apart front the folkrhythm, indigenous modulations of various
types of dialogue-rendering in folk-forms

like

'porattu'

and ‘kakarissi'

५

have functioned

as base for the free improvisation of actors - Angika

elements from 'mohiniyattorn',’Bharatanatyam', Kathakali,
Koothu, and various other
forms have been sources for
actors' training during our rehearsals.
The ‘Aharya' of the play is in a new
pattern' but derived from various

forms

of classical, folk and ritualistic theatre in Kerala.
Realistic elements, along with

elements of 'natyadharmi’ have
acted to bring forth the ’Satwika',
which the actors were encouraged to develop
freely through psycho - physical improvisations.
The sopanarn style of music, an indigenus variation
of south Indian music, is used, as it is

aSSOCiafed with the temples in Kerala and the life
related to religious worship.
