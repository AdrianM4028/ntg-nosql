The Mauryan period (3rd century B.C.) was the hey day of textile Industry.
A full-fledged department under sutradhyaksha (Superintendent of Dress) was set up;
training centres for weavers, dyers, etc, were oponed and hundreds and thousands of
persons of different occupations were engaged in peshas/(an‘ or the embroidery, and
zari work became very popular. Many cities assumed special significance : thus dresses

made in M agadha were called Magadhika, of Bengal were known as duku/a- (muslin), of
