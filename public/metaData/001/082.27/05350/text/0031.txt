CHAN!) SADAG‘AR
bv
M a n mo t h a Roy

Based on the epic struggle of Chand Sadagar and Manasa
( Goddess of the serpents ) from Manasa Mongol. It is a drama in
which you get a realistic story of the volorous fight of Chand
Sadagar who is not inclined to worship Manasa because he worships
‘Shiva'. It is only through his ( worship ), Manasa can have wide

acceptance of herself as a goddess.

So, a furious Manasa is out to

demolish him-his wealth gone and his only son kiled ......... and
then a chain of events load Sati Behula with her dead husband on a

canoe to the heavens.

The dramatic ups and downs of the story have been presented
in the form of a foklore.
