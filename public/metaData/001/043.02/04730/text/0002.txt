Shakespeare
Son ofa yeoman of Stratford-Upon-Avon, William Shakespeare
(1564—1616) was an English poet and playwright. He is now widely
regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and a pre—
eminent dramatist. His oeuvre consists of thirty eight plays, one
hundred and ﬁfty-four sonnets, two long narrative poems, and
several other poems. His plays have been translated into every
major language and are performed more often than those of any
other playwright.
Between 1585 and 1592 Shakespeare began a successful career
in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of the playing
company, The Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's
Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he
died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life
survive.
Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1590
and 1613. He wrote many tragedies, comedies and histories, genres
which he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry. Many of
his plays were printed in editions of varying quality and accuracy
during his lifetime, and in 1623, two of his former theatrical

colleagues published the First Folio, a collected edition of his
dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now
recognized as Shakespeare's.
Though a respected poet and playwright in his own day,
Shakespeare's reputation rose in the nineteenth century, with his
work being repeatedly rediscovered by new movements in
scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular
today and are performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and
political contexts throughout the world.
