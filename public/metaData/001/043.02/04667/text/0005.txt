"After all, in real life, people don't
spend every minute shooting at
each other, hanging themselves,
and making confessions of love.

They

don't

spend

all

the

time

saying clever things. They're more
occupied with eating, drinking,
flirting, and talking stupiditiesâ€”and

these are the things which ought to
be shown on the stage. A play
should be written in which people
arrive, go away, have dinner, talk
about the weather, and play cards.
Life must be exactly as it is, and
people as they are.... Let everything
as
just
be
stage
the
on
complicated, and at the same time

just as simple as it is in life. People
eat their dinner, just eat their
dinner, and all the time their
happiness is being established or
their lives are being broken up."
