Anton Chekhov with wife Olga Knipper

First thoughts on The Seagull
Just imagine I’m writing a play which I will finish probably
not earlier than the end of November, though I sin terribly
against the conventions of the stage. It is a comedy with three
female parts, six male, a landscape (View of a lake), much talk
about literature, little action, and tons of love.
