SYNOPSIS
_
The Seagull (Chayka, 1896). Comedy of frustrated lives. Accompanied by
her lover, the celebrated novelist Trigorin, Mme. Arkadina, a successful but

aging actress, visits the country estate of her brother Sorin. Her son Konstantin, hoping to impress his mother, arranges with his sweetheart Nina to
stage a symbolist drama he has written, but his mother’s thoughtlessly

mocking comments cause him to suspend the performance and stalk off in
a rage. Nina, introduced to Trigorin, is dazzled by his fame, and in the days

that follow, her relationship with Konstantin cools. Konstantin kills a

seagull and reproachfully lays it at her feet as an ambiguous symbol of his
dashed hopes. To Nina the killing of the seagull is another example of

Konstantin’s moodiness; to Trigorin it suggests the possibility of a story
about a free-spirited girl who is thoughtlessly destroyed by a man seeking
escape from boredom. In his despair Konstantin does attempt suicide, and
Mme. Arkadina, fearful of losing Trigorin, abruptly decides to end their
stay in the country. Nina declares her love to Trigorin, and Trigorin makes
an ineffectual attempt to break with Mme. Arkadina. Still, when Nina tells
him she is going to Moscow to be an actress, he arranges to meet her.

Two years elapse. Mme. Arkadina and Trigorin are once more at Sorin’s
estate. Konstantin has published some pieces, but his life is blighted by the

loss of Nina, now an actress in provincial companies. She has briefly been
Trigorin’s mistress, but he has returned to Mme. Arkadina. Now, while the

others are at dinner, Nina slips into Konstantin’s study. Incoherent, renouncing her chosen avatar of the seagull, she tells Konstantin of her hard

life and of her struggle to become a great actress. When he begs her to stay
with him, she confesses that she is too devoted to her career. After she has
left, Konstantin destroys his manuscripts and shoots himself, while in the

next room, unaware of what has happened, Mme. Arkadina is playing lotto
with her friends.
