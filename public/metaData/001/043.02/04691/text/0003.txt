Article 5 ofthe Venice Charter assures that the conservation ofm numents is

always facilitated by their use for some socially productive purpose. I am
particularly interested in the word “some”- Moreover, the added eﬁnition of
authenticity in the Nara document makes me increasingly nervous about the
Preservat10n Industry. Such a declaration almost ensures a oppressive
tolerance. Authenticity is often based on native information a n u hence an

Many years after subalterns speaking and eating, the primitive 1: arformed is
stlll largely eternal because the borders of gender, famlly, home and nation

have to be kept strict for Capital to ﬂow. Indigenousisation lis the most
common argument for culture and development. Athrmatlve sabotage to

such subjection may be initiated by an invention of a counterin public. To
refute a “tokenized 1dent1ty” one needs to create s1mulacra — a p retensron of

authenticity, an original fake.

The play is a fake. An illusion ofanthropology. To>how with unsystemaitised
knowledge structures one needs a training for imaginative activism. It is an
“interrogation to decipher the signs of a heralding” culture. Merr my studies,
anecdotalism, are a mere privatisation of history. On the other hand autonormative disciplinarisation of historiography also needs to be :onfronted.
So, one needs to be

anthropofragic. The play tries to recreate i ”idifference,

problematise authenticity, devalue speciﬁcity. It upholds identity as transient,
temporal and hybrid. The overwhelming presence of the meta- mes sage is

self-defeating because it is coopted by the aesthetic of the “Modern”. “Tupi
or not Tupi, that is the question.” (Courtesy :issf) bus insvsD)
