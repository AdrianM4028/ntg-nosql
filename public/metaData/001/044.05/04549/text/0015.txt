set out for myself ﬁve years ago.
i am grateful to dancer / choreographer / critic Anjana Rajan for collaborating with
me over the years and training my students in NatyadharmiAbhinaya. Her modern
critical approach to classical art forms and her familiarity with theatre traditions
enabled her to evolve a cou rse-structu re to impart training to theatre artistes.
My thanks are also due to HV Sharma, Amba Sanyal, Govind Pandey, Gautam
Bhattacharya, Rajesh Behl, Teekam Joshi and Baldevanand Sagar.
