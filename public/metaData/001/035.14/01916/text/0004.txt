GATH «THE MAJHYASHI
5th November 1981

6 p m.

“Gath ahe Majhyashi" is a tale of two friends
Vishvajit and Satyashil. Both are law graduates.
Vishvajit is a successful lawyer of the high court.
Satyashil on the other hand has

become a dedi-

cated journalist.
Vishvajit is of the opinion that professional
ethics and moral ethics are two different considerations and should never be confused as two
sides of the same coin.

Satyashil, however, firmly

believes that every human action must be judged

by its moral aspects. This difference in their moral
attitudes brings about a rift in their friendship.
On personal level both try their best not to severe
the silken bonds of friendship but on ideological
level they are at daggers drawn.
This conflict between the two friends is drama-

tised by Prof. Vasant Kanetkar in his play "Gath
ahe Majhyashi".
