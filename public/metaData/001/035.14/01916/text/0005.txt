Prof. Vasant Kanetkar has
in this play
«dramatised the conflict between the urge of a
woman to do social work and the duties of a
housewife.

Sadhana, a gold medalist in social sciences, is
leading a normal life of an housewife suppressing
her urge to do social work which was a subject of
.her liking in her academic career.
However, when a destitute enters her house
.as a housemaid Sadhana looks upon this maid as
a subject for case study for her own specialisation
which is 'rehabilitation of destitute women’. As
a result strained relationship between the husband
and the wife dominates the household.
Later Sadhana takes a further step.

Under the

advice of her one-time professor, she takes up a
job at a destitute home, away from her house.
However, there she finds herself in an antagonistic atmosphere of false allegations against her
from the authorities. She leaves this ashram, not
to return to her husband who irnplores her to
come back but goes on ahead to take up a new
assignment 'to seek her own identity‘.
