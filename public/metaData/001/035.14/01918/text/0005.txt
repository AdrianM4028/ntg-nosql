VI D U SH AK
— by V. V. Shirwadkar

Bagaram, a waiter, is a genial person. A rich patron of the bar takes
fancy for him and the two become intimate friends. But the duration of the
friendship is dependent on the degree of the booze. Bagaram falls in love with
a blind girl, a daughter of his co-worker in the factory. He tries his best to
restore her the sight and succeeds. But alas I. Anjali cannot ’see' Bagaram.
