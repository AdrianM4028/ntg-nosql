was slipping away, arranged a secret meeting with Yayati
, and
made it clear that she wished to become his second
wife.
She
said that she had been unjustly made the slave of
Devayani and
that as he was Devayani's lord and master, therefore
he must
be hers also.
Unable to resist her appeal, Yayati consented.
When Sarmistha subsequently bore a son, Devayani though
at first suspicious, was given an eXplanation that allaye
d her
doubts of her husband's fidelity.
Sarmistha was more Circumspect about the births of her second and third sons, but
Devyani finally learned of them and implored her father
to
avenge her, adding what rankled most with her.
'0 father,

here is Sarmistha with three sons, while I have only two.
Yayati pressed for an explanation by Sukra, replied, 'O
brahamana, what I did was from no selfish motive.
When solicited by a woman in certain circumstances, a man may not lawfully reject her.
â€˜Sukra's reply was to curse Yayati that he
should immediately become old and decrepit. .Aware of the
irrevocability of a brahamana's curse. Yayati nonetheless
pleadedfor its mitigation. Finally Sukra declared that his
youth would be restored only if one of his sons accepted the
curse.
The youngest, Sarmistha's son Puru, alone agreed to
do so.
The intention in the subsequent account of his life
appears to be merely to link it with the genealogy of the

Pandavas and Kauravas.
