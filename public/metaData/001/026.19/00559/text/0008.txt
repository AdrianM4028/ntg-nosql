Glowing Threads
in the

Sensitivity to colour shines like

a glowing thread in the web of
Indian life.
Handloom weavers show a profound

derived from traditional associations

with seasons and moods and
feelings. In blending colour and
design they create the artistic fabrics
that you ﬁnd so right for wear on
different occasions and seasons.
