conspiracy to oust Shorashi from priesthood comes to a head.
Jibananda, had seen the selﬁsh motives of the men behind this
move,-Janardan Roy, Shiromani and Ekkari, and had so far

withheld his support to it now in a ﬁt of insane jealousy and
rage, Jibananda tries to use this threat to Shorashi’s position in
the local society so as to force her into submission. In this he
fails.
Jibananda was to learn that Shorashi was made of sterner
and better stuff. A woman of sterling qualities and unimpea—
chable virtues, no selﬁsh consideration bound her to her exalted

position; the only painful part of the threatened banishment
being her separation from the poor folk of Chandigarh whom
she dearly loved and protected from the tyrannies of Janardan
Roy and the other self-appointed guardians of the local society.
She spurns Jibananda’s offer of protection and accepts the decree
of banishment. While leaving, however, she puts in Jibananda’s
personal trust the entire property of the Deity, and entreating
him to look after the poor people of Chandigarh, she was
leaving behind.

The nobility of Shorashi’s conduct and character and her
appeal to the innate humanity in him shakes him into realization
of the depth of degradation into which he had allowed himself
to fall. He now sets himself on the path indicated by Shorashi,
and starts living in the village, with the common people and
working for their welfare, thus redeeming his selﬁsh and purposeless life.
