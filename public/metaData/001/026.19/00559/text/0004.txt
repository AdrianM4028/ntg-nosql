had sold my mother's jewellery years ago and invested the proceeds in National
Savings Certiﬁcates. He had also been adding to this investment by regular
savings _ He enjoined upon, me to save regularly and invest likewise and I am

glad I heeded him. Today L have a small capital which I am using rotadvanced studies abroad.
