CHATURANGA made its ﬁrst public appearance
in May last with “CHARITRAHEEN”, a play based
on Sarat Chandra’s novel. If the Press reviews on the
play were any guide, the public had taken kindly to our
ﬁrst

effort,

despite

some

shortcomings.

We now

present a second play तो Rabindranath’s “SODH-BODH”
a homely but charming comedy of manners.
Amateurs all, we have nevertheless, tried our best
not to be found amateurish in our presentation of the
play.

How far we have succeeded, we leave a discri-

minating public to judge.
We have been fortunate in getting willing cooperation and assistance from many quarters, too numerous
to be mentioned here, and we take this opportunity to

thank them all for the help rendered. We should like
to thank, in particular, The India Offset Press for their
cooperation in the matter of publicity.
