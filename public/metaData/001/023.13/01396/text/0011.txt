The Style of Mayurbhanj Chhau
This dance style has evolved from the original tribal and folk movement in the

regions of Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa.

Since it was patronised by the monarchs

of the past and was eventually elevated to the stature of a court dance-it was further

exposed to inﬂuences from other classical dances-both court and otherwise from India
and abroad.

Hence the viewer and particularly, a student of dance can discern pecu-

liar and beauiiful combination of the stylization and detail of classical form, juxtaposed
with the martial character of the tribal ﬂavour and the natural carefreeness of the folk
idiom.

Mayurbhanj Chhau hails from the district of Mayurbhanj in the State of Orissa.
Traditionally, it has been a male-oriented art form,

with man also playing the part of

woman, wherever the theme of a dance piece demanded the appearance of a female on
stage.

Besides this, the agressive virile martial aspects has always been given ncre

weightage than the lyrical, soft and ﬂowing movements, which are also a very strong
and unique part

of its vocabulary.

This form has evolved through the ages and has

developed the concept of six-section segmented body movement. Delineation of character is achieved by describing the innermost feelings andfpecuiiarities of the subject

rather than blatantly painting the superﬁcial physical attributes.

Rythm is the soul to the form and intricacies of heat allow for varied and interesting movements.

A beat on percussion instrument is not always acknowledged by the

feet of the dancer with a deﬁnite move, but the time gap of the beat is used by the body
for lifting wave like movements. Wind and percussion instruments, eSpecially Dhol,

Nagra (Dhumsha) Mohini Kadka, are normally used.
