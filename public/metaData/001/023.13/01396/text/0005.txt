1 1 . UDAYASTA : And thus the cyclic order of creation continues with the moon-app-

earing at night and the Sun bringing the day—each one naturally connected with
and complementary to the other. And so the natural cycle of life continues . . .
Usha and Ratri the weave-rs of time in their alternating, cyclical and endless appearances, represent the stable, rhythmic patterns of the cosmos in which light and

dark inevitably follow each other in an orderly, predictable manner.

Together they

illustrate the coherence of the created order: the ordered alternation of vigour and
rest, light and dark, and the regular flow of time.
