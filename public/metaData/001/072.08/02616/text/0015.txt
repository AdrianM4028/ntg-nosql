CONSERVE ELECTRICITY AND
SERVE THE NATION
Electricity is too precious a commodity to be frittered away or to be
wasted unnecessarily. Extravagant or ostentatious use of electricity is
doubly harmful—it is unproductive and at the same time, detrimental to
the interest of the nation.

... ... .. Switch on only when you must.
.. ... ... ... Switch off when you don’t need it.
.. Energy saved is energy gainfully used.
.. ...Economical use of electricity means eﬁicient use

of electricity.
