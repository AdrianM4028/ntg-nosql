about the deeprooted corruption in our social and political fields, with the help of our plays. We should
be proud of our predecessors like Kalidasa, Shudrak, Tulsidas, Premchand, Gandhi, Nehru and Bhagat
Singh Azad and we should try our level best to be their apt and able successors.
We should never forget or neglect the millions of havenots leading most insecure and disgracefulives bereft ofall amenities and joys. There are immense possibilities in them also. Let us come together
and face the facts that slumdwellers of Bombay or pavementdwellers of Calcutta are also as hundrd
present human beings as the privileged ones are, They too have all the aspirations, all the fascinations—

may be all cheked up. We, as enlightened and aware theatre people will have to throw light on these

eternally deprived human beings. The true picture of India lies not in the luminous cocktail parties in the
hotel lounges but in the hutmets of the dirty lanes, in the dark and dingy workshop of the poor
labourers. Too long we had anasthetized ourselves against ' there dark and dirty truths, but no more
none. Let us - awake and awaken the entire world to the truth as it is. Let us, theatre people, do
our utmost to depict the true picture of our art and culture.
to be visualised and projected.
