To say something before a drama is presented to the audiance has
little relevance, but it creates some ﬁgures in their minds, say a sort of
curiosity or an eye to judge the depth of art.

Then why not present a

picture of life before the audiance instead saying something about the play.
The life itself is a drama.

Whatever name you give to the reality—drama.

life—— it reveals a struggle where it mingles with joys and sorrows.

“Pinjra” is a story of such a struggle.

It is a story of a helpless .

woman who, caught in the mesh of time, is a victim of struggle between her ' I

heart and soul.

The heart is a piece of glass which glows even‘ in the dim

light of pleasure, but even a minor touch of sorrow reduces it to bits.

We

collect those bits to form them into a single piece again to enable it to
weather the coming storm or just to feel the touch of pleasure. १ On being
broken, it becomes so sharp and pointed that it leaves its
the soul.

Nataraj Academy’s future is intimately linked with your liking or
otherwise of the type of plays it produces or whether it leaves any mark on
your heart. To say the last word, this drama, having been staged in Delhi
many a time, comes to you once again on great public demand.
