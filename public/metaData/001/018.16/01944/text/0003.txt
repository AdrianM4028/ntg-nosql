about the play.
the action of the play revolves round the eighth canto of kalidas' famous classic
‘kumar sambhava’. the first seven cantos of the poem deal with the story of shiva
and parvati Upto their marriage. when the play opens we learn that kalidas has just
completed the eighth canto which describes the intimate relationship between the
newly married co‘uple. the poet is scheduled to recite the new canto at the royal
court of emperor chandraQUpta who is going to confer a state award on kalidas in

recognition of his literary achievements.

'

priyarnvada and ansuya describe the atmosphere of excitement that prevails in the
city on this occasion. but priyangurnanjari is unable to share this joy as she is going
through an inner conflict of her own. since the eighth canto has been written by the

poet after their marriage, she finds only her own marital experiences described in the
poem. she feels quite ernbarrased at this public exposure of her personal intimate
relationships with her husband and therefore. refuses to attend the court function.
in the second act ansuya relates to priyangurnanjari how the function at the
court took a different turn altogether. a large section of the ceurtiers, led by the royal
priest. objected to the sensual portrayal of the most intimate scenes between shiva
and parvati whom people worship as god and goddess.
they demanded that the poem should be banned as it offended the religious
sentiments of the people. In the confusion of arguments and counter arguments, the

Emperor had to adjourn the function without confering the honour on the poet.
