Quite an achievement, no doubt. But
it's really not surprising that 16 lakh
.people read THE ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY
OF INDIA, considering that every week
this popular magazine offers them so

much. Lively features on vital and often
controversial political, social and
economic problems facing India and the
world. Science and technology,
industry and trade, people and places,
flora and fauna, films and the fine arts,
sports and photography—these are but a

few of the highlights. Not forgetting the.
inimitable touch of humour by the

country’s finest cartoonists.
