When I think ab0ut Endgame the following quotations
come to my mind :
"The drama approximates, or can approximate,
to the condition of music, touching chords
deeper. than can be reached by reason, and

saying things beyond the grasp of lcgic ’-'
" ....... ..the task of art is not to solve, but to
contemplate problems...... "
“Instead of being provided with a solution the
spectator is challenged to formulate the questions that he will have to ask if he Wants to
approach the meaning of it "

As I try to approach the meaning of it, i am reminded
that

“The meaning of Samuel Beckett’s plays is to
be sought in their symbols."
At the same time I am warned by Beckett who says
in Watt, “No symbols where none intended."
With this in my mind, when I think of Endgame the

following dialogues from the play and the verses
from the Bible haunt my mind :

CLOV :

Finished. It's finished, nearly finished, rnust be nearly finished.

HAMM :

It is the end, Clov, we've come to
the end.

This is the interpretation of the

thing: Mane; God hath numbered thy kingdom,
anclﬂ'nished it.
