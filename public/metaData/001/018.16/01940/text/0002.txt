For Old man to sustain
The little boy hides under
The Old clothes hang over
And within the crevices
The bugs take shelter.

The girl—the back

I
'
The soul has released.
The remnants—she flings
After the old man
Into eternity/Like his soul.

I _
The old man s time runs Out,
ln walks his ghost, the sleep—
The man of the liOuse—in torment;
Not torment—so much as
Extrication of thoughts
Pervading his soul-innermost.

Peacevthe deathly peace
Restored—e shriek
The mother s lips—escapes.
Perceives--the mother
Her eternity
Before her eyes.
I
Cries out Shelu :

Glides the old man
Into eternity
Remains—his CHARPAI.
The old woman perceives
The tangles that together
The CHARPAI hold—the
Old man's 9hO$l

()n my back—-once again

Now seem to hOld-

l have to carry

Loosens she—the tangles

of old man rides

Old clothes—to pull
To cover the lilth, and

To uncover The vestiges of Time.

The accessibility
()1 the old clothes—and

Bit by bit—dismaMIOS.
Binds together —llle bits

the heredity.
