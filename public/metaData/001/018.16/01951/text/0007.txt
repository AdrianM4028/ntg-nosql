Kala Darpan artists who

Dresented charity shows for five days and collected

funds for the Child Welfare Councnl, Chandigarh.

Dear Mr. Dilgir,

Two shows were given by your troupe.
They were greatly appreciated both by the
soldiers as well as by the ofÔ¨Åcers. In fact
our General remarked that he had never
laughed so much in his life. He was so pleased
that he asked me if we could hold on to the
party for another day.

I hope next

year we shall be able to

arrange a longer visit, with
from KALA DARPAN.

a bigger party

With best wishes,

Yours sincerely
