KALA D ARP AN
Mirror of Arts
In 1953, when people in Chandigarh
were living practically in ‘huts' Mr. H. S.
Dilgir felt the need of introducing cultural
activities in the then dull and dreary atmosphere of the town. With the help of his
friend Mr. S. S.

Bindra,

he

presented

a

MUSICAL EVENING which sparked oﬁ‘
need for more such programmes. Since
then he has been regularly feeding this
‘ground’ with more and still better art and
literature.
In 1965, after a lapse of four years, he
returned from the U. S. A. and realising a

need for an institution which could impart
education in Theatre Arts and Classical
Dance and thereby present the culture of
the State in its true perspective. he founded
Kala Darpan. Cooperation and help came
from many well-known artists from the
U. S. A., Germany and the U. K. Within a
short span of about four years only, Kala
Darpan made an enviable progress and
attracted students and scholars from foreign
countries also.
Governor Dharma Vira said, “Kala
Darpan is playing an important role in the
cultural life of this beautiful city”.
Besides many other plays, we have

presented

award-winning

plays

like

MORCHE WICH, PANJWIN PAUDI and
DAHEJ. We presented for the first time
on the N. Indian stage MAANG KA
SINDOOR, a mighty tale of love, patrio-

tism and sacriﬁce which unfolds a page
from the freedom movement of India.
After seeing the play Dr. Y. S. Parmar
said, “I have been greatly moved by the

powerful theme of the play.”
Kala Darpan is the only institution of
performing arts in the States of Haryana,
Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh
which has produced students who have
been acclaimed nationally. At the time of
the meeting of the Standing Committee of

the All India Newspaper Editors Con
ference in 1967 at Chandigarh, Kumari
Preet Pratima Kaur was awarded a Natraja
Shield by the management of the daily
TARJMAN with
the remarks, “She
possesses an excellent and unsurpassable
art of Katha-nritya”. Another delegate
said,“Kathak could not be purer than
what we have seen today.”
Kumari Vidula won the top-award as
the leading character in our award-winning
play DAHEJ at the 14th All-India Prithvi
Raj Kapoor Drama Festival. Also she
won a literary award from the Language
Department, Punjab.
Our PA’VORAMA 0F PUNJAB, a
complete
programme projecting - the
culture of Punjab through dance, drama
and music. from the times of Tandava
R i shi till
l 9603, won great appreciation

and

To promote performing arts, Kala
Darpan offers from time to time trophies
and prizes to institutions as well as individuals. Two trophies have been donated
to the Government College for Boys and
Government
College
for
Women,
Chandigarh for Shabad Gayan and oneact play competitions respectively.
The credit goes to Kala Darpan for
bringing back to Punjab the renowned
dance-director of Indian movies Guru Gian
Shanker, who had left for Bombay at the
time of partition in 1947. Today we have
lent his services to various academic and
other institutions in Chandigarh. We aim
at bringing people closer to each other
through the medium of performing arts.
Our motto MORE LIGHT FOR WORLD
PEACE is descriptive of our aims and
objects.
