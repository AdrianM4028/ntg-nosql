A Word from the producer
or
Introducing Mr. S. N. Behrincm

Ever since a chance meeting in New York with S. N. Behrman, through
our mutual ‘Guru’ and Dean of the Theatre, John Gassner, I have wanted to
stage his plays.
Mr. Behrman is America’s nimblest and most distinguished writer of
High Comedy and his only real inspiration seems to be George Bernard Shaw.
He has written some highly successful plays, e.g., The Second Man,
Rain from Heaven, No Time For Comedy and his latest hit, The Cold Wind
and the 'Warm. Mr. Behrman’s writing is polished, witty and urbane. He has
a refreshing point of View and his aim is on the one hand to emphasise the eternal
values of life and on the other to expose the pompousness, cant and hypocrisy that
riddle this world.

Mr. Behrman is a dramatist ﬁrst and last, and he sets out

to achieve his purpose with delectable humour and malice towards none.

In Biography 'we share Mr. Behrman’s joy for life and his desire to
open the windows of our minds and hearts to the calm winds of sanity and
tolerance in a world torn asunder by fear, greed and hate.
