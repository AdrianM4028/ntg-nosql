The sun in a man’s life comes not only with the orb in the sky.
It comes with health, and clean surroundings, with the light of
education, play and laughter, living in community.

The social

Welfare programmes of the Indian Cooperative Union bring the
sun into the lives of those whose day is a cheerless night. At ﬁve
centres in and around Delhi, ICU’s Social Welfare Committee

provides medical aid, education for children and adults, games and
sports, music and reading facilities.
With aid from many persons and agencies in India and abroad ICU
workers go out each day to carry out this expanding programme
of reaching for the sun.
