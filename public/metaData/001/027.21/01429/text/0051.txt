Faith that makes man aspire . strive . . .
awakening him to tasks in the early-glow of dawn.
That melts rock, shapes granite; transforms
still waters to surging power.

A faith in the living future:

in a world that offers a little more —-

a little less of the care, a little more of the joy.
Faith that gives meaning to life.
Today, as in the past, our products help to make homes
cleaner, healthier, happier. But today we are also working for . . .
Tomorrow, when the evergrowing urge for better living
will demand still greater efforts. And we shall be
ready with wider service. new ideas. new products . . .

Today and Tomorrow... Hi nd u अंबे
