A MESSAGE

From the German Ambassador
The Theatre Workshop deserves to be congratulated for. producmg
The Diary of Anne Frank and thereby stirring the conscience of
all those who have not yet experienced what untold misery and
human tragedies racial prejudice and hatred can lead to. ॰ As IS
well-known, certain elements in my own country were blinded _
before the war by racial hatred and were responsible for barbaric
sufferings meted out to their own fellow-countrymen and to those
who happened to of a different faith.
But at the same time I can, with conviction, say that Germany
after Hitler’s regime had ended, has shed all traces of racial
antagonism and strives hard to work for peace in cooperation
with all men of good will, irrespective of creed and race. That is
why the play The Diary of Anne Frank has had and is having an
unprecedented success in Germany and is shown in all theatres of
my country.

It is furthermore encouraging that thousands upon thousands
of school children Spontaneously went to the Memorial of Anne
Frank and solemnly vowed that the evil of racial prejudice shall
never sway their hearts and that they will dedicate themselves to
the fostering of harmony and friendship amongst all human beings.
I sincerely hope that this play will be accepted by the Delhi
public as a symptom of Europe’s desire to search for her soul. It
is my devout wish that India, the country which has written the
high moral principles of tolerance and ahimsa upon her banner,
will help the world at large to achieve the ﬁnal goal of liness
amongst all nations.
