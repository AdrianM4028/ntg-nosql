EEARCH FOR A MEANING
The Indian Eaga
The search for a meaning - The Indian Saga is a multi-media theatrical

presentation written and directed by Dr Harjit S Anand specially for
commemorating the Golden Jubilee of India's Independence and 70 years of
the New Delhi YMCA. The dance sequences have been developed by Mrs
Krishni Anand. The presentation encompasses over a hundred years of India's
history. The presentation brings-out the salient, political aspects of our
freedom struggle — the partition of Bengal, Aurobindo's neo-nationalism, the
Horne-Rule movement, the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy, the Non-Cooperation
movement, Gandhi's Dandi March and Civil Disobedience, Quit India
resolution, Subhash Chander Bose and the INA, Cabinet Mission Plan,

Jinnah's Two Nation Theory, Mountbatten Plan and Nehru's tryst with destiny.

Along with the political aspects, the presentation highlights various socioeconomic movements which make the fabric of our freedom struggle
variegated and rich in its texture the educational experiment of Rabindranath
Tagore at Shantiniketan, the contribution of CF. Andrews to alleviating the
conditions of indentured labour, the struggle against untouchability at
Vaikkom, Gandhi's advocacy of Khadi, Patel's leadership of the Bardoli
Satyagraha for reducing the Revenue Assessment on peasants, K T Paul's
message of rural reconstruction, the ‘Nai Talim’ movement and Sahjanand

call for abolition of Zamindari. The contribution of Women has been given
a pride of place in the presentation : Anne Besant, Kasturba, Meeraben,
Karnaladevi Chattopadhyaya, Sarojini Naidu and Aruna Asaf Ali all figure
prominently in the presentation.

“Search for a Meaning—the Indian Saga” seeks to link the past and present
with the future. This linkage is subtly woven into the presentation through
discussion between a History professor and three University students. The
history — Professor performs the role of “Sutradhar” or narrator. The play
examines various problems like caste and cornrnunalisrn troubling the country
and seeks to chart—out a brave, new role for India in the 21st century. An
under-current of the visions of Gandhi, Nehru, Maulana Azad, Patel and Sri
Aurobindo runs through the play, giving it a lucid sense of direction.
