They call it Love—
Making?
Well, that is a hackneyed phrase
It is merry making
A happiness—
Yes, at the cost of others.
Superﬁcial and conceited.
Upper class debauchery.
Orgy of Love and Lust.
Bees collect to gather honey.
But when they leave the ﬂowers are dry.
Love is a mere necessity of ﬂash.
And balm for boredom.
‘Pyar Pyar Pyar’ is a colourful picture of such a
rornace.
Romantic comedy.
Comic farce.
Fa rc i ca I absurdity.
There is a rich married couple—
The wife is in death bed.
And a doctor, And a woman—friend of the wife.

And of course—Cupid's arrow at work.
Love threads in
And out.
Sizzles!

It is serious.

Quite serious.
But then the absurd farce bursts open.

This is what they call ‘Love'.
