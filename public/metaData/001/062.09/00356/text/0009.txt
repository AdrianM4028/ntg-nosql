When we built an engine for the big 747‘,
we were thinking even bigger
The 747 represented the larget jump in airplane growth in
aviation history. But to us it was also a signal of the future.

So we designed and built the JT9D, a jet power plant that could
take on the 747. With the potential to handle even bigger things to come.
And it has.

I n 1969, it had 43,500 pounds of thrust. Then the Dash 7 was
developed. It delivers all of 48,000 pounds. And its reliability is just as
big as its thrust. For over a year, engine dispatch reliability has exceeded
99. 5 %.

!

But there's more. The JT9D is now being buiit to give
52,000 pounds- That means it can power the higher capacity 747
freighters that will take off in ‘75. And even more powerful J T9D's are
on the way. A model with 60,000 pounds of thrust is not for off.
Pratt and Whitney Aircraft.

We build engines that can do the

10b for you today, And tomorrow.
Come grow with us.
