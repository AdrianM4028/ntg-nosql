Fortunately, most of us remember to change th
e brake fluid in our cars.
If we did not, the fluid would deteriorate. And
one day. it would fail to
do its job. There is something else to rememb
er. If the brake fluid level
in the reservoir falls. the brake system is at fa
ult. it may be worn linings;
or a leaking pipe or union; or damaged rubb
er seals; or a number of other
things. So remember, change your brake
fluid. Reﬁll with Castraulic and
have the brake sysrern checked at the sa
me time. it's better to be safe
than sorry.
