There . . . . . . now . . . . . .

He is there . . . . . . Ghalib

. . . . . . H is wif'e . . . . . .
With whom he is oft at battle. . . .
His friends . . . . . . dear friends
Admirers . . . . . . all falling in love with his poetry. . . .
But there is one . . . . . . one person
Shirin !
who has fallen in love with not only his work. . . .
But also the man in him . . . . . .
He is a heavy drinker
But it is the drink that gets drunk . . . . . .
not him . . . . . .
Scenes are changing right in front
of your eyes . . . . . .

Shefta’s house . . . . . . splendid in decor. . . .
Ghalib’s house . . . . . . worn down . . . . . .
By the shudder of the
1857 upheaval.
Music . . . . . . Ghazals . . . . . . Mushaira
To turn your hearts . . . . . . ecstacy . . . . . .
Then all of a sudden . . . . . .
Reality glances at you . . . . . .
Something is missing . . . . . .
Yes . . . . . ॰ Ghalib’s body . . . . . .
Tragic, tearful . . . . . .
His body died long long ago . . . . . .
But he is . . . . . .
Ghalib is . . . . . .
Ghalib will be . . . . . . !
