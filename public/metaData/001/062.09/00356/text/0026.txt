Yes . . . . . . . . he
work . . . . . . . .

Everything of his is alive
Bubbling with life.
Ghalib is the essence of poetry . . . . . .
Urdu Poetry . . . . . . . .
Ghalib is a word too common

yet . . . . . . . . unique
One in a million . . . . . . . .
no . . . . . . . . just one since
The birth of humanity
Just one till the death of Humanity
His couplets touch, clutch
Every aspect of life, reality, truth . . . . . . . .
He is not a dreamer
But an observer . . . . . . . . of life . . . . . . . .

His poems Splash colours. ; . . . . . .
Beautiful colours . . . . . . . .
'I‘hey sparkle, scintillate, stand out in

The world of poetry,
So does his life, his character, his very being

. . . . . . Himself !
a fascinating person, a personality . . . . . .

a man of moods, colourful, queer, tragic, thoughtful . . . . . . . .
Yes this was. . . . no ! . . . . This is Ghalib.
Yes Ghalib is Ghalib

But wait . . . . . . yes wait . . . . . .
A little silence . . . . . .
Yes . . . . . . I feel, I hear, . . . . . .
I think I can also see . . . . . . of course
I can see . . . . . ॰

Of course there he is . . . . . .
Know you not ?

Look ahead . . . . . . onto the stage . . . . . .
