sonalities. These personalitie
fought inside our selves goes on unnoticed and unseen. Behind every one of our responses, a
number of personalities within ourselves manifest themselves.
“Tamasha Aur Tamashai” is the story of one such conflict.

Its author, Prof : Mohammad

Hasan, tries to bring out the pathos and poignancy of this internal conﬂict which spans the
entire life of a poet.
Set in the background of age of dwindling cultural values, the story unfolds the confrontation between the poet and his material existence guided by his ancestory and environments.
His ambitions and imagination both lead him on to live a life different from what his material
and physical existance demanded. This split personality—torn between Imagination and Reality——
forms the main theme of the play. The poet’s cry for recognition and fulﬁlment ﬁnds a response
but at a tremendous cost. His entire existence seems to be on trial and every aspect of his material existence passes through a baptism of ﬁre.

The play opens with a confrontation between the two personalities of the poet—each claiming the credit for achieving posterity himself . In quest of arguments, both of them go through
the various stages of their life which opens with a ﬂashback, when a boy born in an aristocratic family turns poet and in a society of crumbling values, soon ﬁnds himself in the vortex of
poverty, misery and deparavation.

The next ﬂashback brings the poet face to face with the cruel facts of life which he tries to
escape through wine and women. But the romantic episode ends in a tragedy and the woman

whom the poet loved confronts him with the problem of her own individuality.
The dialogue between the two personalities enters its ﬁnal stage when the poet in order to
fulﬁl his material needs tries to compromise himself and as a result is subjected to humiliation
Thus heartbroken and humiliated, his poetic self still sings of yearnings and aspirations, which
still resound in the hearts of millions of his readers—but the man behind the poet still awaits
one who could share and sympathise with him in his W068 and SuﬂeringS.
