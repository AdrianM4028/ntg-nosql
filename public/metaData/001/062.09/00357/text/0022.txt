“Hum—Sub” drama group plans to stage not only classical Urdu plays, but contemporary

Urdu plays and adaptations from regional and foreign languages will also be staged under its
banner. In order to attract talent in play-writing, “Hum-Sub” intends to institute awards for
good Urdu plays.

“Hum-Sub”, it is hoped, will play a meaningful role in popularising Urdu theatre and earn
for it a distinguished place in the world of Drama.

TAMASHA-AUR-TAMASHAI, a play written by Dr. Mohd. Hasan, is the ﬁrst venture
of “Hum-Sub”.
