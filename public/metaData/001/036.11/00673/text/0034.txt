'Hnw India gave the world the leéie of indeterminate equations.
History owes a debt to three Indian
mathematicians of 1500 years ago who
devel0ped Algebra to give meaning to
the meaningless. Bhaskara, who
originated the radical signs.
Brahmagupta, who created the
symbols. Aryabhata, who worked out
' the ﬁrst equations. Original thinkers,
they expanded man's horizon in his
unending search for-knowledge.

_A search that continues today in new
directions with newer tools . . . . among
them, a machine that helps man in
more ways than any other invention in
history : the computer. We are proud
that IBM introduced the manufacturing
of computers and other data
processing equipment in India, which
are helping the nation meet the

challenge of building a new tomorrow.
