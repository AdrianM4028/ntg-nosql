Why are people willing to set aside
part of their income voluntarily as

savings? Why are they willing to forego
the pleasures they might enjoy by
spending the money now as fast as

they earn it ? There are numerous
individual reasons for saving. But
underlying all of them is the desire

to build something in the future...
security, peace of mind, happiness,

- marriage, a home,a family,education,
business opportunity or simply
provision for the unknown.
Saving springs from the realization
by intelligent human beings that
many of the good things in life require
money. . .and that the only way open

to most of us to provide the needed
money is to save it a portion at a time.
