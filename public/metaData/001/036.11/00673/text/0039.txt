Money is what you need to
put in first to ensure a good
yield. Money for farm
machinery, for fertilizer, for
seeds, for irrigation. Money
which you may not have.

But we do. And we can
loan it to you. Our special
loans for agriculturists are
given on very easy and
convenient terms. For full
details on all our services
contact the nearest PSB
branch.
