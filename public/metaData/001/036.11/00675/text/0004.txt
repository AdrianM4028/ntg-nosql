ULTE BAANS
The people of the middle class Community— their joys and woes, hopes and
despairs, their goals and spirits of competition, their day dreams— are modest.
Their ﬂight of imagination and capacity to imitate the West is limited, and inspite
of trying very hard, their minds refuse to forget the Indian culture.
They are innocent. In an effort to sell their simple dfeams they make fools of
themselves. While making fun of others they laugh at themselves.
But they are expert at criticising each other—
Married life is not a bed of roses. Husband and wife are like the Debit and Credit
sides of an account— each complimentary to the other. Household conflicts are a
common and universal feature. But if these conﬂicts grow out of proportion, the
rhythm of life goes off beat and everything becomes out of tune. What remains is
mere cacophony.
All these peculiarities have been ably dramatised by Sai Paranjpye, with her usual
armoury of subtle and light humour in this play. She puts it accross through
diversified hilarious situations taking place in the lives of three neighbouring
couples. There is also a multifaceted, cheerful funster who carries the comedy on his
shoulders. Also starring is the lilting musical score.
You will surely enjoy the show.
