Andre Roussin’s “The Little
Hut” needs no introduction to
the theatre lover.
The Theatre
Group in this latest comedy scored a
record breaking success in Bombay.
Rendered into English from the original French by Nancy Mitford, who
is known for getting the most fun
out of words, this translation does

not lose any of its humour. It ran
for 4 years in London and later crossed the Atlantic to Broadway where it was received with equal enthusiasm.
This sparkling comedy concerns a husband, his Wife and a lover marooned on a desert island. No.
more need be said. Scintillating dialogue and intriguing plot make “The Little Hut" one of the funniest
and most sophisticated comedies in years. It is “French” in every sense.
