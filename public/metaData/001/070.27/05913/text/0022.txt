OUR INVISIBLE Rs. 500/- CRORE SAVINGS ACCOUNT
It’s not in our name.

By that we mean that the crores of foreign exchange that we at HEC save every
year goes to the account of the National Exchequer.
How has this come about ? Well, it has been estimated that HE C, by pioneering
self-reliance in heavy engineering has supplied Rs. 500 crores worth of equipment-which
would otherwise have to be imported-for giant steel plants, fertilizer complexes, mines,

the cement and petro-chemical industries, the Railways, ship builders, the oil industry
and others.
We are able to save the nation so much in foreign exchange because we are
one of Asia's largest heavy engineering complexes.

With its three plants—the Heavy Machine Building Plant (HMBP), the Foundry
Forge Plant (FFP), and Heavy Machine Tools Plant (HMTP), HEC is rightly described as
a unique three-in-one organisation.
But HEC is more than a very wide ‘range of heavy machinery and equipment.
Each HEC product bears the stamp of quality.- For this, the credit goes not only to the
designers, technologists and operators on the shop floor, but also to the efforts of those
responsible for quality control.
No wonder, with this commitment to quality, HEC's products meet with cousto-

mer acceptance-both here and oversease.
Which, in turn, results in larger and larger deposits in the National Savings
Account.
