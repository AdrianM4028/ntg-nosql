‘ _--—Till recently. a shirt was. well . . .just a shirt. A collar. Two cuﬂs. Six buttons down the front.

No imagination. No excitement. The poor male had no recourse but to choose the best out of a dull lot.
And all the fun of shopping was left to women.
Then came LORD JlM. The shirt with a difference. The shirt with a title. The shirt that was created after
intensive research. into male emotions. And female reactions.

LORD JIM.
Tailored from fabrics that measurably improve the psychological well-being of the male Ego. A close. chest

broadening. waist trimming fit.

That nurtures the hidden instincts. Scores of subtle patterns. That throw

subliminal suggestions. And pure. unadulterated colours. To give the girls an inferiority complex. And to
make this. undeniably. a man‘s world. So. even if you think LORD JIM looks like a shirt. think of it as a term
of psychotherapy.
