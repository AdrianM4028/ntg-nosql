The Author

Harold Pinter Born in 1930, He began his career as an actor
in 1948. He started writing plays in 1957. But his first success
was with ‘The Caretaker’ in 1960. Pinter has been writing
also for print, radio, television and film. 'The Birthday Party’
(1958), ‘The Homecoming' (1965), 'No Man's Land' (1978)
are among his welleknown plays.
His early plays, which includes 'The Dumb Waiter' (1959)
are described as 'Comedy of Menace'. Since the source of
the menace is often not explicit, the effect is a strong sense
of floating anxiety. There is an enclosed area and a
' generalized, unspecified horror is created out of simple,

ordinary actions and words. There is a chilling sense of
isolation. People talk 'normally' and yet nothing is
communicated. The refusal to understand and incapacity to
express create an unbearable situation. In short, these plays
allegorically portray the absurdities in our lives in the tradition
of Samuel Backett.
