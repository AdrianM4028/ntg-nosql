PRODUCERS NOTE / AMIR KHUSRO
I feel I owe an explanation to the people of Uttarakhand as
also to the lovers of performing arts about Parvatiya Kala
Kendras staging of Amir Khusro. It may not be a well known
fact that some compositions of Amir Khusro form an inte-

gral part of the semi-classical traditions of Holi-singing in
Kumaon as also some songs sung on the occasion of

told him to make it a mirror of his mystical journey, beginning from the point when he first encounters his mentor—
the great Sufi saint Khwaja Nizamuddin Aulia, to his final
exit. In this presentation we have not taken into account the
political or social turrnoils of the times, and have confined

into the life of people of India—their festivals and customs,
the seasons, the trees, the blossoms and the fruits, and the
small things of life related to their existence like the umbrella or a pair of scissors, and so on. Amir Khusro expressed
great-truths in the language of the people—the language
spoken by them in and around Delhi, which the scholars
have called Hindi or Dehalvi. The presentation ends with
complete surrender of Khusro to his mentor (Peer)——the

great Sufi Aulia.
We all know Amir Khusro was not only a great poet having
written copiously in Persian and Arabic, but also a great

musician. My difficulties in composing music for this pro-
