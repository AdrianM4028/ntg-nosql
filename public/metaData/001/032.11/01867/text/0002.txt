PARVATIYA KALA KENDRA
AND
INDIAN THEATRE
During the last eleven years, ever
since we started working on folk ballads,
the Kendra has been enlarging the scope of
Indian Theatre by adding a new dimension
to it—the dimension of Opera. Its main
contribution lies in exploring the possibilities of ballads, which are an imaginative
mix of history, legends and myth, created,
composed and nurtured by the various
communities spread ever the length and
bredth of our country. In a way they are
oral documents containing reactions, as
also comments of the common man on the

various twists and truns of human history.
We also strongly feel the need of developing an operatic theatre as distinct from
. the musical one, especially in the Hindi
heartland. If we glance around we will find
that all the folk & traditional theatrical
forms prevalent in the North are operatic
in nature, song-oriented rather than movement oriented, as they are in the South.
This feature should be given its due place in
considering the future course of Indian
theatre. We feel, the Parva’tiya Kala
Kendra can take legitimate pride in its
contribution to the enrichment of this
particular stream of Indian Theatre.
