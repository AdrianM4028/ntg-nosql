GANGNATH JAAGAR
Among the ritualistic forms prevalent
in Kumaon and Garhwal, Jaagar constit-

ues a class by itself. The dances related to
this are intimately connected with ghostworship or worship of gram devta or
devies. Mostly they are exorcist in nature,
and are held in the region to drive away the
evil spirits. There is a lot of Singing, dancing and percussion playing in this form—
Hurka and Thali(Bronze plate) being the
main instruments. Some of these like the
Gangnath Jaagar also enact the account
through typical gestures and movements.
Gangnath falls among those gram devatas
who were the victims of a caste-bound
society. These characters perished at the
hands of a conservative social order, but
were transformed into demi-gods to be invoked and worshipped in these Jaagars.
It is a strange kind of poetic justice done
to them by the community.

The present stage adaptation of the
original ३ balled ‘Gangnath’ has been
named ‘Bhana—Gangnath’ because Bhana,

the leading female character emerges as a
defiant Bhana. who curses the existing so—
ciety and its moral code which are still
strong. Certain new characters have also
been introduced by shri B.L. shah in the
story in order to give it a proper dramatic
structure.
