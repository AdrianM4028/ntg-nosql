MEGHDOOT
Meghdoot of Mahakavi Kalidas—translated by renowned
Hindi literature Nagarjun, is not a play like the other ones

written by him. He dwells on the mysterious relationship
between the animate and the inanimate, the cosmic unity,

as it were, that mankind has ever been aspiring to achieve.
It depicts the sufferings of heavenly denizen, called the
Yaksha, who has been exiled by Kubera, the God of wealth ,
to a place on earth called Rarngiri for one year, punishing
him for negligence of his duties, due to his deep intimacy
with his newly-wed wife. By selecting the cloud as the
messenger of Yaksha, Kalidas had given an entirely new
dimension to his poetic imagination transcending the
bounds of the living and the non living.

Out of the entire work spread over one hundred and
seventeen verses, only thirty verses have been selected
for this presentation, some from "Poorva Megh" and some
from "Uttar Megh". The imaginary ﬂight and journey of
the cloud messenger, has been depicted through dance
movements and other images symbolic of the rainy

season, only as supportive elements, the main vehicle of
presentation being the music, vocal or instrumental.
