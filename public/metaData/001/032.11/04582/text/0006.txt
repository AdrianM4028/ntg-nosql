lnder—Sabha ( 1 991 ) was another major presentation to revive

the traditional theatre of India. The Kendra presented it in
Delhi, as well as in Udaipur and Jaipur under the auspices

of Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Academy.
Apart from these, the Kendra also used the heritage of songs
and literary creations of theatrical productions having roots
in struggle for national liberation. Ganga (1986), Lal-Gulab
(1986), Vande-Mataram (1987) and Sanjhi Virasat (1993)

were four such ventures. Of these Vande-Mataram,
sponsored by Delhi Sahitya Kala Parishad, became an annual
event till 1994 which was witnessed by general public and

८ thousands of school children.
Similarly, the all time great play Meghdoot by Kalidas was
presented in a mix of Hindi and Sanskrit in an operatic form
(1993). On the demand of theatre lovers it was repeated

again (1994) and again (1995).

To bring into focus the contribution of the great Urdu poet
and saint to our composite culture - Amir Khusro (1997)

was staged which was well received by Delhi theatre lovers.
It was selected as a play of the year (1997) by Sahitya Kala

Parishad, Delhi, and was staged during its drama festival Bhartendu Natya Utsav, on Feb. 7, 1 998 at Shri Ram Center,
New Delhi, and again on Feb. 11, 1998 at Shanker Lal
Auditorium, Delhi University, Delhi.

Shri Mohan Upreti who led Parvatiya Kala Kendra through
its various phases left for his heavenly abode on June 6,
1997. In his memory the Kendra presented Uttarakhand

Folk Songs and Folk Dances in Sept. 1997. It was followed
by an ‘entirely new presentation - Goria (Goloo Devta) in
May 1 998. Exactly one year after, another luminary of Kendra

Sita Swayarnber in Oct. 1998. The opera Meghdoot was

inspired by Baba Nagarjun who left us on Nov 5, 1998. The
