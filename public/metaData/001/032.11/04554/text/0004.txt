hated and arduous work, villagers often used to ﬂee
from their homes and used to hide in the forest and

when caught, they were punished severely.
The play Coolie Begaar seeks to dramatize this
inhuman system and peoples’ suffering and their
intense yearning for freedom. The characters are
ordinary people but they display extraordinary
courage to defy a brute force. We admire these
unlettered and unknown people. The play also
depicts the hardships the coolies face while

performing their duties. The officers stay in Dak
Bungalow well protected from the winter cold, collies
are condemned to shiver in the open during night
haults.

Among these characters is a priest who is forced to
join coolies. He carries a sack on his head. As he
walks, the containers inside the sack start clattering.

When he is told that the sack he is carrying contains
pot being used by Sahibs and Mernsaibs as toilet, he

throws the sack and goes to Haridwar to undergo
the purification ritual. A newly married young man
is also here and his bride disguised as a boy follows
her husband. Inspired by Mahatama Gandhi, a
school teacher resigns from his government job and
joins coolies with a View to make them politically
co nscious .

Depicting the intimate conversation of these
characters and their bitter encounters with British
stooges leading to gradual political awakening in
them, the play moves to the climax set at the 1921
Bageshwar, a holy place on the bank of the river

Saryu, resolving to boycott Coolie Begaar which
ﬁnally forced the British rulers to stop it.
