September 21, 1982

I am happy to know that the Par-vatiya Kala Kendra, which
is engaged in the presentation, propagation and popularisation
of the folk arts of Kumaon and Garhwal hills, is presenting
another ballad ‘Ajuwa Bafaul’ ; the earlier one was the opera
‘Rajula Malushahi’ presented in … February and repeated in
May ’81. On this occasion, a Souvenir is also proposed to be
brought out. I hope both the presentation of the ballad and
the Souvenir will highlight the heroic character of the people
of Kumaon and Garhwal hills, their love of nature, simplicity,
honesty, endurance and their love of life.

I wish the ballad and the publication of the Souvenir all

success.
