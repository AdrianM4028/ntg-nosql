Dear Shir Upreti,

I~ am glad to know that the Parvatiya Kala

Kendra is continuing its good work by the
presentation of another balled 'Ajuwa Bafaul'
on September 29, 30 and October 1 st, 1982
at Karnani Hall, New Delhi. I have no doubt
the
that through this artistic spectactle
Parvatiya Kala Kendra will be able to stimu
rich
late interest and evoke respect for the
hill
and inspiring cultural heritage of the
regions of India.
