I am pleased to learn that the Parvatiya Kala
Kendra, Delhi, will present the balled â€™Ajuwa
Bafaul' in operatic form. I have watched the
productions of the Kendra with interest and am
aware of the good work it has done. It has
successfully introduced the folk culture of the
Kurnaon and Garhwal hills to the people of Delhi.
I wish the Parvatiya Kala Kendra, Delhi success.
