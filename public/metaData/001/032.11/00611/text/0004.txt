The Parvatiya Kala Kendra began its second phase by adapting the folk ballads
of Kumaon Er Garhwalto contemporary stage. Rajulaâ€”Malushahi was the
first attempt of its kind. Shri Brijandra La | Shah, who is widely familiar with
the background culture and folk traditions of that region, prepared the first
script which, however, covered only half of the ballad. The script was in
Kumaoni. and was produced in an operatic form. The first performance of
this production. was given in 1980 at Kamani to packed houses.
Encouraged by the tremendous response we received, we decided to present
the full ballad. It was produced 8 presented in 1981. This production was a
turning point in the life of the Parvatiya Kala Kendra. it was remarkable in the
sense that for the first time a production of this dimension was mounted
capturing the essence of the cultural heritage of the people of Uttarakhand.
It was also remarkable in the sense that stalwarts of Delhi stage like Vinod
Nagpal and V. M. Badola performed in the production alongwith many fresh
entrants to theatre and another eminent theatre personality, Shri B. M. Shah
directed it. The script, as of earlier, was that of Shri Briendra Lal and musical
score was that of Mohan Upreti. Since this event the Kendra did not looked
back. Every year it has taken up a new ballad of the region and given it a
dramatic form.

The wide spectrum of the folklores of the

region

that have

been covered are given blow in the resume of activities.
