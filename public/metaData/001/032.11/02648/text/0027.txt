Late Shri Mohan Upreti founde
r and erstwhile President of Par
vatiya
Kala Kendra had endeavoured
to promote and project the cult
ural heritage
of Uttarakhand through theoreti
cal presentations and enrich the
knowledge
in this

vital field of human creativity.

It is a matter of satisfaction to lear
n that Kala Kendra is presenti

ng a
programme of folk songs and dan
ces of Uttarakhand during Septem
ber 2021, 1997 at New Delhi in memory
of their founder.
I trust that the activities of the Ken
dra will continue to be inspired by

the dedication and commitment of late
Shri Upreti.
