It is heart warming to know that Parvatiya Kala Kendra is keeping the
memory of Sh. Mohan Upreti alive by presentation of Folk Dances and Songs
of Uttarakhand. My association with Mohan j i personally and professionally

spans almost three decades. The memory of the commencement of the
Kendra's Holi Utsav with the Parvatiya Kala Kendra procession is one that
we will always cherish. His work in the upliftment of the folk traditions of
Uttarakhand is truly commendable. I wish this festival a success so that the

work started by Mohan Ji may be carried out with as much commitment and
zest as he infused into it.
