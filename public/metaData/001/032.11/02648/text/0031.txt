I am glad to know that the Parvatiya Kala Kendra is holding a programme of

Folk songs and Folk dances of Uttarakhand on September 20-21, 1997 to
commemorate the services of late Shri Mohan Upreti and that a Souvenir

will be released on this occasion.

Please accept my greetings and good wishes for the success ofthese functions.
With regards,
Yours sincerely,
L.K. Advani
