I am indeed very glad to know that Parvatiya Kala Kendra, New Delhi
is to present a Programme of Folk Songs and Folk Dances of Uttarakhand in
commemoration of Late Shri Mohan Upreti, the founder of this pioneer
institution, known for qualitative theatrical presentations.
I am also happy to know that a Souvenier is also being brought out to
commemorate this occasion.
I appreciate the efforts taken by the organisation to maintain and promote
the cultural heritage of the country by popularising this art.
I convey my best wishes and compliments for the successful conduct of
the programme as well for release of a Colourful Souvenier.
