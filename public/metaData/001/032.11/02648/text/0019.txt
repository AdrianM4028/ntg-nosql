students of the National School of Drama and the
presentation of two poems by Kunwar Narain are
memorable theatrical events. Both were enriched and
embellished by Mohan Upreti's music.
A very special aspect of Mohan Upreti's music has
been his ability to be innovative with each production.
Beginning with his very ﬁrst presentation Rajula Malu
Shahi, to Indra Sabha, he has never repeated himself. Let
it be a play by Brecht or a contemporary play like Maha
Nirvan or a Nukkad Natak he always gave something new.
In this age of consumerism he supported new and small
theatre groups without taking a nayapaisa.

Today the theatre workers are face to face with antitheatre attitudes, silen‘ce, coldness. Mohan Upreti faced all

this silently and continued to work. Even today the theatre
workers and playwrights are referred to as "Nachiniya‘ ‘
Yet if Hindi theatre is alive and kicking its because of

committed theatre workers. Our homage to Mohan Upreti
a name that represents energy and enthusiasm...

While the condolence meeting was coming to its end
with a two minute silence many of us wondered will there
by another Mohan Upreti?
