ROOTED TO THE CORE 000
And headed for the world of the future.
At the core lies a technological strength which has
consolidated
BlLT’s position as India's foremost paperrnaker
for over six
decades. A strength which propels it into the future.
So that, in 2003 when the Indian paper deman
d is 5 million

tonnes, BILT will meet it with over 70 percent of
the brightest, finest
papers.
And, as South East Asia starts looking
towards India-and BILT for paper, the BlLT chemistry will be workin
g in yet another area;
India's largest producer and exporter
of phosphoric acid will add
one more link to the value-addition
chain by making phosphatic
fertilizer and pesticide intermediates.
Even as it rakes in returns from corpor
ate agriculture, meshing
core strengths with core lndian advantages.

For BILT, it is back to the roots.
Or core strengths, as it were.
