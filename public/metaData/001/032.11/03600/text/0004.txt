B asa nt is disposed of his land by village Zami ndars. He

is deeply attached to Ashadh for his defiance of rich
peasants who are exploiting poor farmers. He has taken

a fancy to B hadon and wants to make her wife by fair
means or foul. All he gets is a disdainful rebuff from
B hadon and has to confront her fury. Ashadh’s mother
vehemently opposes her son living with Bhadon. She
even co nspire s with Basant to get rid of Bhadon.

Now the people of both the villages across the river
have come to know about the hideout of Ashadh and
B hadon. The f'ather—in-law othadon and a feudal lord
set the hut in which Bhadon and Ashadh live, on ﬁre.
Sometime after this brutal act both the villages are

visited by famine, diseases and deaths. The river driesup. This natural calamity brings the rival villagers
together. The local deity is invoked. The medium in

trance diagnoses the cause ofthe calamity. The culprits
are identiﬁed and banished from the village. A temple
of B hado11 and Ashadh is built as an act of propitiation.

Fortetting their past feuds, the people of both the
villages now live in harmony. They still hear the
captivating melody of Algoza cornong from the distant
mountains.

The playwright depicts beliefs and social and
economic contradictions of Kumaon. His very choice

of the title of the play Algoza assumes special
significance. It plays three kinds of tunes- romantic,
worldly detachment and sad. Known in Kumaon as
Jaunyan Murli, according to Jugal Kishore Pethshali, a
poet and f'olklorist, Algoza symbolizes the union of
human soul with god.
