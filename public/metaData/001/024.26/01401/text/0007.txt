Collegiate Drama Society
DRAMA
COLLEGIATE
SOCIETY was formed 1n 1978
by some teachers and students
of Delhi University with two
basic purposes in mind. First, to
give motivation and direction to

the creative urge of these. people
by forming a group which was
completely their own and could
work at par with the professronal
groups of Delhi Theatre. Second,
to produce plays prescribed m the

text syllabus of Delhi Universrty.
We have since been successful in
both our purposes.

Now the Group consists of, apart
from University teachers and
students, a young clan of business-

men and professionals running
varied units ranging from P V,C,
footwear to chemicals, from
advertising agency to readyrnade

garments.

Despite

commercials,

We’ve produced original Punjabi
and Hindi plays and have received much applause from both the audience and the critics. With
our repeated efforts we have been

successful in raising the reputation
of Punjabi plays as only ‘smutty
farces’ to respectable theatre. Our
activities are described as “serious
attempt to create a better and

wholesome image of Punjabi
Theatre in Delhi” writes The

their busy

schedules they ﬁnd time to serve
the theatre in a healthy, congenial
atmosphere. It is this feeling of
being one family that has taken
us so far.
Some members of our group have
acted
in
ﬁlms,
advertising
T. V. Serials and

T. V. short ﬁlms. The group
nowadays is also busy in making
of a television serial of one of its
productions.
Apart from the critical acclaim
and audience support, the group
has also bagged nine prizes in the

Annual
Drama
Competitions
conducted
by
Sahitya
Kala
Parishad —— ﬁve ﬁrst prizes for
script-writing, one for direction
and three for acting. We have

also recieved three prizes from
