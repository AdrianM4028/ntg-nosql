Hum t0 wise Iu’ [min
,4 mm to 7/८८८८८८ 7am
The play Hum To Aise Hi Hain is based on Kahani Rangkarmi ki a story
0 f a theatre artist who is very much dedicated and honest for his art. He describes
how he joined theatre and how he is surviving in this ﬁeld although he has many

pressures from society and his family too.
Society doesn’t think theatre is a career to pursue. He is into mood ofacting
every time. In his subconscious there are lots ofplays and lots ofrnonologues. He is

so much involved in theatre and in his real life he inspires with interesting theatre
characters and tries to act like them. For example Viloin oanshaad ka ek din,
Macbeth and Othello.
Besides his theatre career the main character ofthis play is a puppeteer too

and his room is full ofpuppets. He thinks that these puppets are his only friends.
Only these puppets can understand his feelings. He shares every thing ofhis life with
his puppets.
One day he gets very frustrated after a long struggle period and tries to commit

suicide. At the moment he is trying to die all the puppets in his room shouts at him
and tells him that he is not killing himselfbut he is killing an art. One ofhis favorite

puppets asks him that, answer me a simple question before you die. Who will play
me after your death?
The main character ofthe play turns positive and promises him that he will not die
but he will now try to ﬁnd out a reason to live his life.

The play gives a message that an artist never dies but an art dies, when an artist takes
these types ofsteps. The play consists ofa good story, puppetry, and experimental
way to collect audience and overall it’s a celebration oflife.
The play has also been performed at world performing arts festival
