SY N OPS I S
lndusekhar, a cunning and prosperous jotedar of Sonakuti village
commits all sorts of unscrupulous deeds to exploit and rob the poor
peasants.

As if to avenge the age-old exploitation of lndusekhar and

Company, Haran's widow has given birth to a peculiar creature—human
in form but with long sharp teeth and gigantic strength. The new-born
bites and attacks the upper strata of the village population, carries out
large scale destruction of their property but does no harm to the poor
and downtrodden.

People have started calling it 'Mahakalir Bachcha'.

Great commotion is created among the people who are always
discussing the activities of this new species—in buses, trains restaurants
and houses.

Newspapers are filled

with

stories

about

this peculiar

creature ; TV and Radio are working round the clock to keep the people
posted with the latest development ; police, administration and local

jotedars are trying hard to get hold of it.
But arresting and imprisoning the first 'Mahakalir Bachcha' does
not solve the problem. The problem is too big ! Every new-born in the
poor peasants‘ families is a ‘Mahakalir Bachcha' ! They are attacking the
whole structure of exploitation with ever-increasing ferocity and ruthlessness .... until it crumbles down.
