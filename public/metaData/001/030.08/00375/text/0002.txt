About Ourselves दे-ज्ञा-श्वसे-वा

Dhumketu, a cultural organisation of the capital, steps into

year of its existence.

' [In-mmM»;

15th

Established in 1967, our activity centred round

performance of drama with a a definite purpose.

Obviounly we do not

believe in drama for drama sake nor it is a past time for us. As Chirstopher
Candwell said "Through science we can know
through art we can know’ the subconscious"

the outer reality and

This subconsciousness, is

the social awareness, the fellow feeling for the toiling masses, fighting
brutal oppression and the social evils

This inspires us to stage socially relevent plays and if one looks
back, it is evident that we have been staging plays throughout these long
years which talk all about the toiling masses.

This ideology inspires

us even to bring out a quarterly journal which we could not sustain
due to many factOrs.

On this occasion we are staging Mohitk'Qhﬂattopadhaya's ‘Mahakalir
Bachch a’, which portrays the eternal fight between the oppressed and the
opp resso r .
In conclusion, I thank all of you who have gathered here today to give
us encouragement and patronage.
advertisers also.

I take this opportunity to thank all
