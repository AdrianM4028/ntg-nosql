It is India that gave man
the ingenious method of
counting all numbers by ten
Symbols and freed him from
the bondage of counting on
his fingers.

Among these symbols the
most modest, yet the most

valuable of lndia's subtle
gifts to mankind was. the
zero.

Derived from the square
shape of the Yagnakunda
used in worship, each of
these symbols was given a
value of position as well as

an absolute value.

These numbers were in
c0mmon use in India in
Ashoka's time (273-232
B.C.). it was to be a
thousand years later that
Muhammad ibn Musa
al-Khawarazmi introduced
them to Baghdad, from
where they found their way

to Europe.

Lending mathematical
computations ease and
simplicity; these symbols
made possible the

calculation of what before
was incalculable. - _ .
Over the ages man's
methods of solving
_ mathematical problems
have been growing to meet
his complex needs. Today

ingenious devices enable
him to make intricate

calculations in billiOnths of

for him to attack problems '
in ways never possible
