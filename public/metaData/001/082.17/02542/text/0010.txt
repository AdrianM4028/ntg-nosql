in theatre in Hindi, I had for many years done only Marathi plays.

Some months later he had come to Chhabildas, to witness a play. He told me he had an idea, a germ for a play.
I asked him to write and give it to me to direct. He agreed provided I did it for ‘Awishkar’. It was alright
with me, as I only work for and with ‘Awishkar’ for my serious experiemental theatre projects.
He wrote the play; a simple yet intense story on the life of the Adivasis.

In this version Chaiti unknowingly and unwittingly sticks the “more wage” demand poster, which disturbs
and angers the owner of the forest produce godown.

I was fascinated by the poster sticking by the workers and Patel getting angry and ﬁnally consenting
to increase their meagre wages.
Dr. Shesh had given me a rough working script and wanted to attend the rehearsals and make some changes
and add some things. I had discussed the play with him and had requested him to add three songs
and a song at the end, wherever I found the Kirtankars talking too much. This also was done with a sense of
pattern and design, in the total texture of the play.

He politely resented my not inviting him to the rehearsals, which I had done for some genuine reasons :
a) I was fascinated by the play as it was and gave me scope to improvise with my actors.
b) according to me last minute changes confuse the artists and restricts their performance, and lastly the play
was to be performed at the State Drama Competition, the date of which was coming near.

So inspite of my request to add new scenes for Chaiti, which would give her more dimensions,
could not be done for the pressure of the time set for the opening performance.

Unlike the playwright I prefered and refered the two story-tellers as Kathakars. As a director I had Puna Ram
the Chatisgarhi ‘ Katha-Vachak ’ at the back of my mind as a take off point for these characters. The word,
Kirtankars, refered by him originally limited the secular scope and colour which I wanted to bring into the
production.
Doctorsaab also wanted me to get a live tableau of Heaven and its paradisical glamour and another tableau of
Hell With its torturous horrors. He thought that I could show my forte at creating colourful stage
compositions.

My problems were two fold; which Heaven and Hell to show, the Biblical one or the Hindu one of which

there is hardly any pictorial concept. The ﬁrst one would be out of context and the second one would be vagu
e.
But when I thought of not using any props I did away with the tableau-idea. As I could not show forest
products mentioned in the play their picking, sorting, cleaning packing was all to be mimed, the
photographs and poster the crucial prop in the play was also mimed. I left to the actors and their reactions
to depict what was shown in the so called photographs of Heaven and Hell.

But one thing I must say for Doctor-saab as I always called him His plays had been done by expe
rienced
directors like Satyadev Dubey and Arwind Deshpande and as comparatively young and new director

he gave me full scope to do the play as I wanted to do and liked it.
