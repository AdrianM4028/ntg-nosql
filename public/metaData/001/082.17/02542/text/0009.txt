AWISHKAR AND CHHABILDAS
Chhabildas School’s contribution to theatre is not new, as we now know the late Prithviraj Kapoor and his
troupe have had rehearsed many of their classics in the school’s hall.

Awishkar’s service to the theatre movement in the city is of aquiring the Chhabildas Boy’s School Hall
through the courtesy and generosity of the Governing Body of the General Education Institute
which runs the school in Bombay. And renting it to threatre groups doing experimental,
away from the beaten track theatre work, at a very nominal charge in Dadar,
which is now the heart of the city.

Plays at Ch_habildas are never done with an eye on the box-ofﬁce. They are meaningful and purposeful plays,
without a stance, bais or prejudice, but which nevertheless would like to make the artiste,
the doer and audience the seer, aware and perceive the changing human values.
Plays in Marathi, Hindi, Malayalam, Tamil and Sindhi have been performed at Chhabildas.

The Indian National Theatre Bombay has had performed, many a marathi traditional theatre forms in this hall.
The work done by the members of Awishkar is honorary; none of the artistes derive any monetary beneﬁts.
But the work is of a high professional standard, in terms of competence, integrity and ethics.
None can accuse its members of being mercenary.

Awishkar’s training programme has covered a vast area of performing arts.
Prof. Ashok Ranade, Head of The Department of Music, University of Bombay has conducted speech
and voice culture training workshops which have been very successful.

Srnt. Sulabha Deshpande has been conducting Children Theatre Workshops, and young boys
and girls from various schools have beneﬁted from this workshop since August 1975.
