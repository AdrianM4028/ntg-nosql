After our festival, this is the second production
of our new season. The first was "RAAG DARBARI”

so called achievements.

Indian families. If after watching the play, both of us—

meaning — we the performers and you the audience grow and become a bit more sensitive to our older
people, I would consider it my greatest achievement.
