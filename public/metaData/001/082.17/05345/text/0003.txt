IT IS A PARABLE
AN UNUSUAL INCIDENT.

In this day and age, there are a lot of thick skinned individuals who simply
do not think of their behaviour as decet or indecent, ethical or unethical. At some

point oftheir careers they cross the thin line that separates compromise from crime.
Their souls are armoured and their lives are endless monologues. Dialogue, even

with themselves, is not possible until they suffer a debacle or are stripped oftheir
positions and privileges. At such moments they become conscious of the simple

human virtues which they have somehow lost. “There are only two genuine kinds
of misforture” said Leo Tolstoy, “illness and pangs of conscience.
The man in ‘Aakhri Peshi ’ is a symbol and a person, a ﬁgment ofimagination,
a reality. He can be a wise old man or an angry young man. The main thing is that

he stirs our conscience.
Dealing with such a sensitive subject was not easy. The actors have been told
: ‘Everything must be done in such a way that the audience hears the scream ina

whisper’ . ¸
