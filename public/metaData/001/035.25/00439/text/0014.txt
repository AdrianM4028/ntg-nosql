Director’s

Note

It has given me great pleasure to work with a team of young, amateur
artists of this College.

They have all worked with great dedication towards

putting on a particularly difﬁcult play.

Because of their great devotion, sense

of duty, team work, I never had any anxious moments.

I thank you all, the

participants and their parents and the audience who have come from all parts
of the city to encourage us.
