The Company:
The Chorus Repertory Theatre was established in the valley of small hill state, Manipur that
is surrounded by the great nine-folds of mountains guarded by mighty tribes on the top in
the easternmost part of India in April 1 976 under the able leadership of Ratan Thiyam.
Located on the outskirts of Irnphal, Manipur's capital city, Chorus Repertory Theater's twoacre campus has been slowly built (and six times rebuilt after disastrous monsoons) to

accommodate a self-sufﬁcient way of life, with housing and working quarters for the
company. It is nowan important regional and national centerforconternporary theatre. In
the year 2001 on its 25- anniversary season, the company dedicate its first permanent
theatre, a 200 -seat auditorium conceived and designed by Ratan Thiyarn with space for
set construction and storage.
मं Thiyam's 1984 Chakravyuha, performed more than 100 times in many countries, thrust
the company into the global spotlight. With Uttarpriyadar'shi, equally acclaimed as a
masterpiece, Thiyarn continues his examination of the human condition, expanding his
explorations of war and power to embrace the search for enlightenment, reconciliation and
peace.
