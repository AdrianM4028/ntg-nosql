DIRECTOR'S NOTE
The world is in constant flux. And we often question its very being and our presence here. How can humankind

evolve in the best possible way? The more we are developed in science and technology, the more we seem to
regress, to lose our mental and spiritual balance. Despite the presence of such powerful bodies as the United
Nations and human rights organizations, violence and war continue to accelerate. Increasingly it seems like the
good in man is overwhelmed by the evil. As a result, man has lost control of his innate qualities, the facility to find
peace and equanirnity within his very soul. Priyadarshi (Ashoka), the protagonist in this play is one such man—
confused, misguided, beset by evil cornpulsions. We may not choose Priyadarshi’s path to overcome the destructive
in ourselves, but we can choose to be constructive and compassionate in our journey through life—Ratan Thiyarn

SY N OP S I S
PROLOGUE: Uttar-Priyadarsh i opens with the chanting of a prayer by the four Samvadaks (monks). These narrators
are joined by eight members of the chorus bearing symbols of the eightfold path of Lord Buddha. They pray to Lord
Buddha and praise his benevolence.
FLASHBACK: A ch i Id plays with the dust of the earth in a courtyard. He stops suddenly as the wandering Sakyamuni

Priyadarshi), future king of the Mauryas.
WHEEL OF TIME: As the Samvadaks extol Lord Buddha, who looks upon all with eyes of compassion, they form
a mandala (wheel of time), and move from the past into the present. In the background, prayers are chanted.
