(Based on Mahakavi Kalidasa’s Ritusamharam)
THE POET

Saint poet Jaideva writing about Mahakavi Kalidasa says, ”Poetry was a child of Valmiki who was groomed and
nurtured and brought to the enlightened world along with embellishments of numerous forms and hues of Leelas by
Bhagwan Ved Vyasa. That damsel of muse (Kavita Kanya) with glittering ornarnentations and adornments of Vidharaba
tradition, on her own accord, accepted Kalidasa as her bridegroom”.
Sixth century poet Kalidasa’s gems of his poetic genius in Sanskrit literature that have been acknowledged world
over and presented on stage in numerous translations include works like Abhignan Shakuntalam, Malavi kagn i rnitram,
Meghdootam, Ritusamharam, Kumarsambhav, Vikrarnaorvashiyam, etc.

THE PLAY
Based on ’Ritusamharam’ by Kalidasa, this play is a description of Indian cycle of seasons, portraying the close
interaction of life and nature. Kalidasa writes about the six seasons: Grishma, Varsha, Sharad, Hernanta, Shishir,

Vasanta in graphic details. it narrates, in impeccable detail, the impact of seasons not only or, the human psyche,
animals’ and birds’ behaviour but also on other animate or ornamomate things like insects, flora and fauna. His

poetic images are insightful, graphic and powerful.

DIRECTOR’S NOTE
A narrative poem by birth, ”Ritu” is not a play in the conventional sense. Kalidasa describes six seasons in as
many episodes and they are being presented in visual interpretation as it is. Each episode is complete in itself. There
is no tangible story line and there is no effort to create one.
The performances try to underline the fact that all human energy is derived from the nature. Now that man is
isolating himself and moving away from nature, he is loosing that power and energy that he derived from the
bountiful nature.
It is a simple expression, through his own vocabulary, of a director who lives in a contemporary world. It is that
simple.
