QEburus Repertory Wheatre
be Chorus Repertory Theatre was established in the va
lley of the hill state, Manipur which is
surrounded by great n ine—folds of mountains guarded by might
y tribes on the top in the easternmost part of
India in April, 1976.
Located on the outskirts of Irnphal, Manipur’s capital city, Cho
rus Repertory Theatre’s two—acre campus has been
built (and six-times rebuilt after severe rnonsoons) to
accommodate a self—sufficient way of life, with hous
ing and
working quarters for the company. It is now an important re
gional and national centre for contemporary theatre.
This year, on its 25th anniversary, the Company dedicates
its first permanent theatre, ”The Shine” which is a
ZOO-seat auditorium designed by Ratan Thiyarn to the publ
ic.
Thiyam’s 1 984 Chakravyuha, performed more than 100 time
s around the globe, thrust the Company into the global
spotlight. With Uttar-Priyadarshi, equally acclaimed as a mast
erpiece, Thiyarn continues his examination of the
human condition, expanding his explorations of war and
power to embrace the search for enlightenment,
reconciliation and peace.
Equipped with its most outstanding performances in many
International festivals in India and abroad, this Repertory
has been able to earn the prestigiou

s ”Fringe Firsts Award, 1987” from Edinburgh International

PROLOG U E
In this verse, where the nectar flows,

called Dharrnakshetra Kurukshetra.
By chanting the Mantra of Hari through swords,
By chanting the Mantra of Vishnu through arrows
,

We are throwing red abir and celebrating
the festival of Hol i with red blood from pichkari
In this Mahayagna, with the great sacrificial rites
of power grappling,
we all become the offering the great power hunters
have already let loose their horse of
Ashvamedha for sacrifice.
