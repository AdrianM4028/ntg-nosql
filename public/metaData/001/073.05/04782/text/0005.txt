East meets West The Pit Theatre

Saturday 29 September 5pm-6.30prn (£5/3.50)
Two generations ago portrayals of life in India and
Africa came predominately through the words of
novelists such as EM Forster and Graham Greene.
Now that novels by writers of Indian and African
descent are prominent on our bookshelves, has our

perception of these cultures changed? And has the
form and substance of the mainstream arts in
Britain been affected? Join Alastair Niven and a
panel of writers and dramatists including Balraj
Khanna, Jatinder Verma, Yvonne Brewster as they
discuss how one culture can shape another.

The Barbican is owned,
