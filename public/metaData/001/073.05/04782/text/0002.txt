of Kalinga. The Samvadeks recount his
exploits as conqueror of the vast
continent.

Scene Two
Priyadarshi commands his Bhat-charans
(royal musicians) to sing nandi.
‘ glorifying his victory and fame. But the
emperor is mocked by the Samvadeks,
who call him a proud and lonely king. He
throws away his blood-stained sword,
and laments his unfulfilled dream of an
empire where people can live a
contented life free from fear. Once more
he orders the royal musicians to sing
nandi. Instead, he is greeted by the agonised cries of the war widows. He is
engulfed by sorrow and grief, and feels
the ghosts of his fallen foes advance and
surround him. To drive them away, he
vows to punish them by throwing them

A Bhikshu (rnehdicant monk) enters with
a message of hope for liberating all
humanity from the wheel of suffering;

monk finds the strength to endure, free
from fear. The flames of Hell are
extinguished as the Bhikshu sits alone
on a lotus; the space around him turns
calm and serene. Enraged, Ghor orders
his attendants to display their evil
power, to no avail.

Scene Seven
Priyadarshi enters Hell, finding it
tranquil and still. Ghor torments him,
ignoring Priyadarshi's reminder that he
himself made Ghor the Lord of Hell.
Priyadarshi, seeing that the Bhikshu is
undisturbed by Hell's misery, asks the
monk how he has escaped. The Bhikshu
challenges Priyadarshi to look deeply
into himself; to recognise and embrace
the evil within him as well as the good,
for only by doing so will he be able toliberate himself. Priyadarshi, longing for
release from human suffering, accepts
this gift of enlightenment and feels Ghor
depart from within him.

into Hell. He orders his minister to find
someone who is both ferocious and evil.
The minister chooses Ghor, wanton destroyer. and Priyadarshi - against the
will of the people - appoints the
malevolent Ghor Lord of Hell.
