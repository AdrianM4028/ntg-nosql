itself becomes Hell. He commands his male attendants
to destroy anyone entering his domain, including
Priyadarshi.
Scene Four
Crossing hills, valleys and streams, the traveling
Samvadaks are lured into Hell by Ghor’s female
attendants who are disguised as pretty girls. The
Samvadaks are trapped and abused but ﬁnally escape.
,
Scene Five
Ghor's means of torment are unveiled, their use
illustrated as victims are tortured and killed.

Scene Six
A Bhikshu (mendicant monk) enters with a message of
hope for liberating all humanity from the wheel of
suffering; he prays for the light that will wash away
ignorance and bring enlightenment. Discovered by Ghor,

who taunts him, the monk ﬁnds the strength to endure,
free from fear. The ﬂames of Hell are extinguished as
the Bhikshu sits alone on a lotus; the space around him
turns calm and serene. Enraged, Ghor orders his
attendants to display their evil power, to no avail.
Scene Seven
Priyadarshi enters Hell, ﬁnding it tranquil and still. Ghor
torments him, ignoring Priyadarshi’s reminder that he
himself made Ghor the Lord of Hell. Priyadarshi, seeing
that the Bhikshu is undisturbed by Hell’s misery, asks
the monk how he has escaped. The Bhikshu challenges
Priyadarshi to look deeply into himself; to recognize and
embrace the evil within him as well as the good, only by
doing so will he be able to liberate himself. Priyadarshi,
longing for release from human suffering, accepts this
gift of enlightenment and feels Ghor depart from within
him.

THE HISTORICAL ASHOKAIPRIYADARSHI
Uttar-Priyadarshi‘s protagonist is Ashoka, also known
as Priyadarshi or “One Who Looks With Kindness. “ The
third emperor of the Maurya dynasty (324-187 BC),
Ashoka is a remarkable ﬁgure in the history of India. His
predecessors, his grandfather Chandragupta Maurya (c.
324-0. 300 BC) and his father Bindusara (c. 300-0. 272

an ethic promoting peace, tolerance, and the welfare
of all living beings under his sovereignty. Ashoka's main
concern, as expressed on his edicts, became the
propagation of dharrna, a concept which has many
connotations, such as truth, morality, righteousness,
and familial and societal responsibility. In Buddhism,
an Indian-born religion which was gradually on the rise
in Ashoka's time, dharrna has the speciﬁc meaning of
the Buddha’s teaching, and the frequent use of the
term in the edicts has led many to conclude that Ashoka
converted into being not just a Buddhist, but a very
pious one atthat.
There is much debate among scholars about whether
or not Ashoka himself was actually converted to
Buddhism, and whether or not his dharrna should be
understood strictly in Buddhist terms. There is also
disagreement over whether or not Ashoka used the
edicts for mere political expediency. However one
comes to understand the life of Ashoka/Priyadarshi,
the varied and often ambiguous nature of his deeds
and edicts reveals to us a most fascinating human
ﬁgure of complex, if not conﬂicting, motivations and
concerns.
