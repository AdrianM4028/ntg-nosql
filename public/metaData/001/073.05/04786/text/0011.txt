7 lo ] ] JAN
2003

my own self —— when the first rays of the sun reflect on me from the snowy

peaks of Marcia/whim llr when | get friendly with the silvery fish while
swimming in thehlue waters of fol/km. llr when my new friend I'd/mm
comes along and asks: 'You search dream again?’
lhe walls around me: How long have I talked to you — only you! My husband,
son, daughter, even my neighbours —all have been walls. I hate the joke

of it! But then, you alone knew how I dreaded the life beyond the four walls.
Asa child, jumping from the high walls was just a child's play to me. What
has happened since? Slowly, inexorably, Shanu Hoychowdhary was buried

in the shadows of the 42-year-old Mrs Shanu Mazumdar. You asked: 'How
are you?’ Shanu Mazumdar responed: 'I am llll.’ 1111, for the vegetables are

fresh. lift for we are all keeping well. lift, for the children are physically
intact. lhus we merrily carry on. And, then, before we can discover ourselves,
we cease to exist, crushed by unspent every and unrealised dreams.

I was a wife. । was a mother. llnce again, /'ﬂfﬂi/Iﬂiﬂ/Momﬁm{ Can't I
ask you to sit beside me by this lake, overseeing mountains. and sip with me
— though not officially — some Pepsi?
Yours truly,

Shanu lloychowdhary
