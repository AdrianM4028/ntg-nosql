(Based on R
Kalidasa)
'I‘ h e P o e t :

Saint poet Jaideva writing about Mahakavi Kalidasa says, "Poetry was a child of llalmiki
who was groomed and nurtured and brought to the enlightened world along with
embellishments of numerous lorms and hues ol leelas by Bhagwan lled Vyasa. lhat damsel
ol muse (llavita llanya) with glittering ornamentations and adornments ol llidharaha
tradition, on her own accord, accepted llalidasa as her bridegroom".

7 to l l JAN
2003

Sixth century poet llalidasa's gems at his poetic genius in Sanskrit literature that have
been acknowledged world over and presented on stage in numerous translations include
works like Abhignan Shakuntalam, Malavikagnimitram, Meghdootam, Hitusamharam,
llumarsamhhav, llikramaorvashiyam, etc. etc.
The Play:

Based on 'llitusamharam'by llalidasa, this play is a description ol lndian cycle of seasons,
portraying the close interaction at lite and nature. Kalirlasa writes about the six seasons:
Erishma, Varsha, Sharad, Hemanta, Shishir, llasanta in graphic details. It narrates, in
impeccable detail, the impact ol seasons not only on the human psyche, animals' and
birds' behaviour but also on other animate or inanimate things like insects, ﬂora and
launa. His poetic images are insightlul, graphic and powerlul.
Director’s note:

A narrative poem by birth, ' llitu' is not a play in the conventional sense. llalidasa describes
six seasons in as many episodes and they are being presented in visual interpretation as
it is. Each episode is complete in itsell. ihere is no tangible story line and there is noellort
to create one.

The per‘lormarrcesrtryto underline the lact thatall human energy is derived lronr the nature.
Now that man is isolating himsell and moving away lrorn nature, be is loosing that power
and energy that he derived from the bountilul nature.

It is a simple expression, through his own vocabulary, of a director who lives in a
“contemporary world. rlt is that simple.
