The Chorus Repertory Theatre was established in the valley of small hill state, Manipur
that is surrounded by the great nine-folds of mountains guarded by mighty tribes on the top
in the easternmost part of India in April,1978.
located on the outskirts of Irnphal, Manipur’s capital city, Chorus repertory theatre's twoacre campus has been slowly built (and six times rebuilt after disastrous monsoons) to
acconnnodate a self-sufficient way of life, with housing and working quarters for the
company. It is now an important regional and national center for contemporary theatre.
This year, its 25th anniversary season, the company dedicates its first permanent theatre
called " The Shrine", a 299 - seat auditorium designed by Batan Thiyam with space for set
construction and storage.

Thiyarn’s 1984 Chakraryvuha, performed more than 1 DD times around the globe, thrust the
company into the global spotlight. With Uttarpriyadarshi, equally acclaimed as a masterpiece,
Thiyam continue his examination of the human condition, expanding his explorations of
war and power to embrace the search for enlightenment, reconciliation and peace.
