Performance Description
PANAW, meaning, journey, is multi media musical theatre performance by women
music and theatre artists from Mindanao called the Mehuyan Peace Project.

fhe perforruance dwells on the themes of life, death, and peace-concerns laced
by contemporary Filipino women every day. lhe story revolves around the Mindanao
goddess Mehuyan and how her mythical presence weaves through and affects

the lives of three contemporary women: battered wife and overseas worker Rosario,

7 f0 1 1 JAN
her dead mother Delia who died fighting to protect the sacred mountain Malakinay

2003

from logging, and tribal priestess Bae Malimlim who brings the two women
together.

fhe music-theatre is inspired from the Manobo myth about Mehuyan, the goddess
of the underworld who declared to rule over life and death after parting ways with

her brother lumabet who ascended to rule the Sky.
fen years from the last known research about Mehuyan (1992), the goddess has

since transformed into an evil god banished to the depths of the earth for having
committed an evil deed. The performance aims to reclaim the existence of the
dying goddess.
Panaw promotes the concept of life and death as part of a long journey. lt upholds
the idea that living people must resolve their lives in the here, and now lest their
souls become restless and full of anguish in Mebuyan's domain and could get

stuck there, unable to journey further to Bimokudan, the soul's final resting place.
At the same time, the play nurtures the idea that the journey IS the destination as

it tackles the issues of domestic violence, land loss, environmental destruction,
and women's search for empowerment and meaning in their lives.
