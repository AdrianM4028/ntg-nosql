Franklin D. Roosevelt to take up the work on the development of the Atomic bomb. The letter was signed by the
Albert Einstein on August 2,1939 and was delivered to the
‘ President on October 11, 1959, Roosevelt acted at once and
the Manhattan project was born. In 1943, he chose the plateau of Los Alarnos, near New Mexico to establish the Manhattan Project. Several Scientists from Britain, US and other
refugee scientists worked together to develop the atomic bomb.
By the spring of 1945, after an expenditure of 2000 million
Dollor the bomb was ready. On July 16, 1945 atomic bomb
(Uranium-235) was tested on a desert near Alamogordo Island, New Mexico, for the first time, men witnessed the
deadly an awesome mushroom cloud of an atomic explosion
rising 40, 000 ft. into the sky.

Many atomic scientists who took part in the A-bomb project at Los Alamos did object the direct use of nuclear
weapon on a Japanese city without prior warning of the
potential of the new weapon and without giving ultimatum
either to surrendes or to evacuate certain regions. However,
President Truman turned down the move and was in favour

of using it on a Japanese town.

On August 6, and 9, 1945 two atomic bombs were dropped
over Hiroshima (Uranium-235) and Nagasaki (Plutonium-239)
respectively.
The whole of makind has come under great threat from the
nuclear power countries with more deadly thermonuclear bombs
thousand times powerful than those two tiny little atomic bombs
of crude device which had reduced Hiroshima and Nagasaki
into ashes within fraction of seconds. This followed a world
side political debate, nuclear ban treaty, arm control, Pugwash
Movement and so on.

The question is-“Should we repeat the Hiroshima Nuclear
Holocaust ‘2”.
