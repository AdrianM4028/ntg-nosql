DIRECTORâ€™S NOTE
For the last many years my productions has been concentrated mostly on war themes because of the effect of the war
which has affected us directly or indirectly. For me the _ grow-

ing phenomenon of violence in human nature is a disease
inherited from the nuclear

race all over the world.

The; recent development of the system of Nuclear weapons
poses greatest threat that human being has ever experienced.
The Atomic bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were only
like a tiny drop in the ocean in comparision to the Nuclar
test carried out in this modern world which clearly indi
cates
the system of wiping out the whole human race and civiization.

This
with
and
cing

play is an account of Hiroshima and Nagasaki b
ombing
an attempt of giving more importance to
the message
designed for the modern man to help him in ad
vana few steps towards peace.
