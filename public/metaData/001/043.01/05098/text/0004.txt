7’{Charishma' was a speciality
of the Parsi theatre and it was used for
attracting people. Through 'charishma'
one can lure any one. In the Parsi
theatre 'charishma' is our own unique
thing. This had nothing to do with the
theatre of Shakespeare.

की T here was a scene of
chopping 01३1` Ganeshji's head. Now
Ganeshji's head has to be chopped off
so what they used to do was. . . normally
a man's height is about live feet but they
would look for a boy who is three and a
hall‘. l le was ﬁtted with 'body' made
from an iron—strip. For sticking out the

times, hence the angry Shankar pushes
Ganesh and pushes him so hard that the
goes into the wings. He comes out
again and says: 'No, I won't rel cnt'. Two
three rounds are done. Third time.
instead ofthe real Ganesh the other boy
comes out. People e o u l d not
differentiate because he too is wearing
the same costume and headgear. So the
third time he doesn‘t come and Shankar
hurls his 'trishul' at him and his head
falls on to the ground. so does the boy in
pain. The pieces of cloth stuffed inside
the head become visible and it seems as
if the blood is oozing out. Those days
the public never used to go into the
details. Nowadays, let the head be

actually chopped off and the people
would suspect. and not believe even in
truth. Truly people did not understand
so 111 u e h in those days.
