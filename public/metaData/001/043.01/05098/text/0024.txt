In this production , it has been not only attempted to fulﬁll
the requirements ofthe training ofthe 2nd year students in Parsi Style, but it has
also been attempted, that when today's modern actor acts in the Parsi Style
how should he connect this with today's realistic style of acting. How should
an actor make a balance between the understanding of Parsi Style of acting
and today's realistic style ofacting in such a way that it holds up the reputation
ofthe pros of Parsi Style and that it also gets a new form.
Parsi Style contributed incredibly to the Indian freedom struggle. The
playwright with the means of dialogues that had hidden subtexts, evoked the
feelings of patriotism, love, sacriﬁce, mercy and made the people revolt
against the British rule.
This is the beauty of the writings of Pandit Radhey Shyam Kathavachak,that
५ the dialogues. written in that period, are still very relevant today . Today when
not only in the country but in the entire world corruption, immorality, anarchy
are booming, the relevance of Mashriqui hoor has became even more
signiﬁcant. In the play a brave girl Hameeda ,with the help of the public
removes a corrupted and unjust king from his throne. At the time of the
freedom struggle it was a voice for overturning the British rule. But today it
can be looked as the role ofdemocracy .
In the original play, Hameeda sacriﬁces everything, but we have tried
to give the play a slightly different meaning ,which is more in relevance with
today. Our 'Guardian ofthe truth' says that along with ﬁghting for the truth, it
15 equally important to be vigilant, because the oppressive powers rises up in
any form even at the slightest ofa chance. I am grateful to Mr. Vageesh Kumar
Singh for re-writting the end ofthe play in Parsi style.
According to me today workingin the Parsi Style18 a way ofconnecting back
with traditions and also along with that, it is maintaining the creative values of
the play, makingit successful ata commercial levelas well.
