DUET FOR ONE. Stephanie was an eminent violinist until struck
down by multiple sclerosis, which now confines her to a wheelchair. On
her husband’s advice she comes to consult Dr Feldmann, to help her

adjust to a life that has been deprived of its main interest. At first she
appears to have made a fairly successful attempt at this; helping her

husband (a famous composer) in his work, taking pupils etc. Under Dr
Feldmann’s quiet, probing questions, however, very different pictures
emerge: layer after layer of protective pretence is stripped from her,
revealing dangerous depths of resentment and despair.
