WILLY RUSSELL

Willy Russell was born in Whiston near Liverpool and left school at
fifteen. He went through a succession of jobs before, at the age of
twenty, he decided to take ‘0’ and ‘A’ levels and become a teacher. At
about the same time he saw John McGrath’s play UNRULY
ELEMENTS at the Everyman and decided he wanted to became a

playwright. Since then he has written BLIND SCOUSE, JOHN,
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO AND BERT — which won the London

Theatre Critics’ and the Evening Standard’s Awards for Best Musical

1974 — BREEZEBLOCK PARK, ONE FOR THE ROAD, SAM
O’SHANK‘ER, STAGS AND HENS and, of course, EDUCATING
RITA, which he wrote for the RSC. It won the SWET Award for the
best comedy of 1980. It ran for 2/2 years in the West End and is

currently playing Australia, Turkey, Brussels, Israel, Mexico, Denmark
and Paris. The RSC Touring version is now playing all over the British
‘
Isles with Kate Fitzgerald (who played ‘Rita’ in Willy and Pip
Broughton’s production at the playhouse in 1981). Shooting of the film

version of EDUCATING RITA has just been completed and the film
is now on general release.
His television work includes KING OF THE CASTLE, BREAK—IN,

DEATH OF A YOUNG, YOUNG MAN, OUR DAY OUT and THE
DAUGHTERS OF ALBION. His series of five films for ITV will be
shown shortly. Willy is also a founder and director of Quintet Films
with Victor Glynn, Jack Gold, Mike Ockrent and Jack Rosenthal.

Quintet’s ﬁrst production — SHAKESPEARE LIVE — was transmitted
on Channel 4 on January 5th this year. His musical BLOOD
BROTHERS has recently opened at the Lyric Theatre transferring

from the Liverpool Playhouse.
