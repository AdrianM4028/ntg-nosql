The Play
Ras—Gandharva is not merely a play but a phenomenon, a whole gamut of the socio-political
contradictions characterising our society.

Mani Madhukar has related the Pauranic politics with the contemporary one in a real ingenious way,

The play begins with the frightening calls and shricks of the prisoners and concludes with the suggestion
that only ﬁrm determination of human beings win a war. The jail in the play represents the society and the

prisoners are its inhabitants who are constantly engrossed with gthe thoughts of an imaginary world outside
the jail but are unable to break the walls.

The play, indeed a satire, touches almost all the darker aspects of our system.
