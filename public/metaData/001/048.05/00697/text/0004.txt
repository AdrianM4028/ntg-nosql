drama, music. Her unique talent was reaffirmed in her first

production in India, Gogol's VIY. GRAHON Kl KAHANI, her

DAK GHAR :
Rabindra Nath Tagore's play centres around a child, Amol, who
is confined within the narrow walls of his room. He is not
allowed to eXplore the vast world outside. Through the
window, his inquiring gaze captures the panorama of the
passing world, absorbing it and thus enriching and expanding
his restless spirit. We gnave used a grown up actor to portray
this questing and res-ﬁve spirit, for each sensitive individual
carries within him aagmilar spirit of curiosity and enquiry. The
voice of the BauIs—traditional rninstrels of Bengal, the poetry
of the Sufis, the longing of the Bhakt, these have been used
to symbolize the restlessness of the soul.

What is Dak Ghar? Is it a delineation of the delicate fabric of
human relationships, the warp and weft that twines one human
being to another ................. ? We leave it to the audience to
find out.
