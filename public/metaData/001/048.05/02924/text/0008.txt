DIRECTOR’S NOTE

The complex history of mankind
lends itself to a multitude of interpretations. Each age has scrutinized
its past through contemporary

eyes. Every conscientious artist
has tried to interpret history in
relation to his times. In Karnad’s
Tughlaq, Gargi’s Sultan Razia,

Rakesh’s Aashadh Ka Ek Din and
Shakespeare’s masterpieces the

artist has penetrated beyond the

dry words of history .books
perceiving the live human drama
inherent therein.

Human nature is unfathomable.
It contains more secrets than the deep
oceans or the vast cosmos.
The compleicity of human behaviour
has been a subject of great interest
to artists over the ages.

I was at ﬁrst hesitent to take up
a Mughal subject, for I did not
feel fully equipped to present the
true ﬂavour of that period. But the
play is really much more than a
period play. Surendra Verma’s
Chhote Saiyz'd Bade Saiyz‘d is as much
an eiTort to reﬂect contemporary
reality through historical characters
as to evaluate history with a modern

sensibility. For me it is a play of
human situations, human aspirations
and human failings. The situation
and characters are basically no

different from those that spring out
of my morning newspaper, any
one event spreading across the
entire page.

The Repertory Company is
producing an original play in Urdu
after quite some time and it is a
welcome change.

I am thankful to Shri Surendra
Verma for his cooperation.
