received that the play had to be restaged for 3 further shows
in September.

I n April this year MASQUE ventured into the very difficult area
of a play about euthanasia and a couple's problems with

their (only) spastic child—but belying expectations,

Peter

Nichols’ A DAY IN THE DEATH OF JOE EGG directed by
Teleshwar Singh, ran to good houses, was widely appreciated, was considered worthy of support by the British Council
and the Spastics Society and firmly established MASQUE as
a vibrant group which was here to stay, and of which there
are many expectations.

We have ambitious plans for the future but are facing all the
problems that non-profit creative organisations dedicated to
the performing arts so often do, We are in need of affordable rehearsal space, donor members, advertisers and sponour
sors. We are also looking for those keen to participate in
activities both on and off stage. If you can be of any assistance, would like to join the group or be on our mailing list
