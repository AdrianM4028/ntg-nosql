And finally, there is Felicity, bitter and aggressive about the pain and
suffering caused by the illness but holding on with sheer strength of will
because of her conviction that her dead daughter Claire, on whom she
doted, will come back soon. The situation has become what it is because
her older daughter Agnes, who is now with her, unable to cope with her
mother's non—acceptance of Claire’s death, has perpetuated the make
believe through letters. actually written by herself, which she reads to her
mother as if they were from Claire. The guilt of this deception has tormented her fcr long but she has never admitted it to herself, and is unable to
bear it when confronted with the fact by the Interviewer.

In all cases there is, in different degrees and manifestations and at
different points of time, denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance, and in all cases there is hope,

Hope, that

somehow,

in some way,

it may not happen, We play games with ourselves and with each other
when confronted with the crisis of slow death. Some of us are able to
work it out, some not. But there is always the sense of helplessness, the
flashes of despair, the clinging to straws, or (as with Felicity) the escape
into a world of make-believe, And all this applies equally to the persons
confronted with death and those inextricably tied up with them,

The interviewer, in many ways, can be seen not only as what he is on an
obvious level (a sort of therapist who is providing himself as a sort of

30unding—board to the actors in the drama of the cottages), but also as
a voice within the interviewees' own minds, asking the questions which
they know lurk within themselves somewhere, but which some of them
are not prepared to ask themselves, and which the others have asked themselves again and again without being convinced that they have the right
answers.
