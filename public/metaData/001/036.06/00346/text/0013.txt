In October 1 983 a group of young theatre enthusiasts who
had already been involved in the Delhi amateur English
theatre scene for some time decided to get together and
form a new society for the performing arts. The aim was to
provide a breath of fresh air and yet another forum where
enthusiastic thespians could find a platform for interaction
and expression-but this would be a group with a difference :
democratic in functioning and style with no single leading
personality at the helm of affairs, uncompromising on quality
and professional

standards,

gradually

moving towards a

unique amalgamation of English and Hindi theatre into a
mixed language framework with which audiences could easily
identify, and eventually passing beyond just drama into the
other performing arts and audio—visual media.
MASQUE was registered as an official society on 26 March
1984.

Since its inception MASQUE has successfully staged 3 productions, all at the Sri Ram Centre in Delhi, all critically
acclaimed and most running to overflowing houses.
American playwright Dennis Snee's 'TWAIN BY THE TALE',

a hilarious collection of extracts and sketches from the work
of Mark Twain, linked together by Twain himself appearing
as a character,

was a fresh and delightful

beginning to

MASQUE’s career. Directed by Sunit Tandon, it was staged
on 3, 4 and 5 April 1984 to packed houses and excellent
critical response,

Keeping up the attempt to stage extraordinary plays for the
first time in India, lVlASQUE chose well-known English playwright Simon Gray's never before performed play BUTLEY
(Delhi audiences had seen the film version starring
Alan
Bates) as its second production, A strong and powerf
ul
drama about inter-personal relationships in a London
Univer—

sity setting, its brilliantly witty and bitingly satirical
dialogue
and situations made it an out-and-out success.
4 shows in

August 1984 directed by Bhaskar Bhattacharji were
so well
