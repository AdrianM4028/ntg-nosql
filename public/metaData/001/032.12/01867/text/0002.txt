PARVATIYA
AND

During

the last ele .n years, ever

since we started working [.71:7..;7.:::..:1..:2::1:12:2;:-00
the Kendra has been enlarging the scope of
Indian Theatre by adding a new dimension

to it-the dimension of Opera. Its main
contribution lies in exploring the possibilities of ballads, which are an imaginative

mix of history, legends and myth, created,
composed and nurtured by the various
communities spread ever the length and
bredth of our country. In a way they are
oral documents containing reactions, as
also comments of the common man on the
various twists and truns of human history.

We also strongly feel the need of developing an operatic theatre as distinct from
the musical one, especially in the Hindi
heartland. If we glance around we will find
that all the folk 8: traditional theatrical
forms prevalent in the North are operatic
in nature, song-oriented rather than movement oriented, as they are in the South.
This feature should be given its due place in

considering the future course of Indian
theatre. We feel, the Parvatiya Kala
Kendra can take legitimate pride in its
contribution to the enrichment of this

particular stream of Indian Theatre.
