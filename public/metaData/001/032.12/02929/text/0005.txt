MASSAGE

My dear Mohan,

Thanks for your letter of lst December, 1988. Herewith a message for your
Souvenir:

The Parvatiya Kala Kendra Delhi has been dedicatedly working for the promotion
of the arts of the Central Himalayan region.

The Himalayas are the cradle of Indian civilization and the culture. The Central

prov1ded
Himalayas has been the source of many cultural traditions. They have also
the space for the inter—mixing of many plural traditions.

It has been heartening to see the manner in which the Parvatiya Kala Kendra
Delhi has grown from a small nucleus to a major institution.

I wish the institution and its programmes all success.

With kindregards,
Yours Sincerely, ,

प (KAPILA VATSYAYAN)
