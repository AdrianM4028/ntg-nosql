The Technical Director helps the Art Director and both of them jointly
finalise the designs and get the final approval from the Director. The sets and scenes
are prepared and painted under their joint supervision and they see that the style.
method and medium confirm to the style of the production as a whole.
We have art and technical

Directors

in our film

industry.

Fortunately or

unfortunately in our theatres. these jobs are handled and finalised more or less by the
Director. Beacause of lack of trained personnel, the Director has to shoulder many more
responsibilities. He is a Director Cum set designer. stage technicians and what not!
We have still a big crew of stage personnel. They are the costume designer,
the wardrobe Mistress; light operator. lncharge sound and effects, property master.
and make up artists etc.
After all "the elaborate preparations

and hard work finally, the Show must go

on. It must pay and bring good returns at the Box Office. For this business side of
the production. we have the Business Manager. and his staff. He has under him the
publicity Officer. who looks after advertisements and determines what type of publicity
will prove effective.

For auditorium management, we have House Manager and his staff,â€” smart,
well dressed. smiling. and courteous auditorium receptionists (Ushers) to welcome the
audiance and ready to help and guide them.
Planning and methodical work alone can settle the technical and other problems

of play production. Demand work. hard work. but see that the joy of work is not lost
at any stage of production. A little encouragement and a few kind words may work
miracles. In the theatre no work is small or low. What matters is how that work is
implemented. " There are no small roles. but small actors," said Stainslavasky. I may
elaborate this statment and say that there are no small jobs in the Theatre but small men !
