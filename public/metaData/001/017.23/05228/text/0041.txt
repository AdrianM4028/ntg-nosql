My main agitation in the past few years has been primarily on these two points.

Cultural Affairs, each State will be building one or more Theatres to commemorate the

Centenary of Rabindranath Tagore. l have, however, pointed out to the Ministry and
other organisations interested that empty buildings do not create a culture. Culture
is only created by full time workers, who are professionals and not amateurs. The

amateur field is only a breeding ground for talent. which eventually is recruited by
its professional counterpart. However. whatever may be the historical reasons. we have

a situation where there is a complete lack of balance in the theatrical sphere, a growing
activity of more and more amateur groups, whereas the professional groups, which can
be numbered on the fingers of one’s hands, remain static. As I have pointed out. many
times elsewhere, every other section of culture has its professional artists as the main
body producing its works of art, but not the Theatre. But in all countries of the world

today, including the lands of classic private enterprise. Theatres are being subsidised by
the State as well as Municipal and other bodies. for it is now recognized that culture
is as necessary a part of human life as sanitation!
With the impetus you will receive from being newly born this year, you will
utilise that impetus in your own sphere to obtain concrete support from your Government

for the setting up of at least one central National Theatre Company which will have as

its permanent centre the new theatre building which will be created next year for the
Tagore Centenary. Everything else must be subordinated to this. Without the creation
and development of the professional National theatre in India there can never be any

genuine theatre, nor any flowering of national Drama.
If there is any way I personally can help, I shall be happy to do so. I am prepared
to produce a Play, to design and equip a theatre and advise on training and plans for
the future development of theatre activity !

Can I say more—for the show must go on.
