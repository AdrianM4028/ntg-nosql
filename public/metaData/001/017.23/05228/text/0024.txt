'2'7th March,

1960.

I am very happy to learn that the Madhyastha Natya

Sangh, Baroda,

is organising a Drama Festival in Baroda

from the 15th to the 24th May, 1960 and that theatre orga-

nizations from Bombay, Ahmedabad,

Rajasthan, Baroda and

Saurashtra are participating in this Festival.

There are.

very few Universities in this_country apart from the M.EL
University of Baroda, which realise the importance of

Dramatics assa

subject of University discipline.

In the

United States of America and to some extent in England now,

the subject of Drametics is getting its proper place in
University education.lhurkind of creative activity, which

enables.the students to Cultivate'their emotions apart from
५
intellect, should be encouraged. We have very ancient
traditions of Drama in this country; but we have largely

been following the old traditions without in any way. trying
txndepart from the old traditional routine and revivifying
them so as to suit modern conditions and modern times.a
I trust the Madhyastha Natya Sangh will try to chalk out a

new line instead of following the traditional professional‘
drama. I wish the Festival every success.
