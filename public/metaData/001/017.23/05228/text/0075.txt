Gopal feels ver
wiser for his age. On a Deepawali Day, when he is in his moments of lucidity Aapsa's
chains are removed. He puts on a festive dress and starts to go out for marketing. All of
a sudden, however, he relapses into a fit of madness and goes on the terrace and jumps
from there, with the result that he is caught between the electric wires and dies.

The whole family is then plunged in grief and little Gopal takes a vow that he will
work hard and be a good man and wiil prove to the world that although a doctor's
but a mad—man’s so is not

son may be a doctor, and a lawyer’s son may be a lawyer,

necessarily a mad man.
After lapse of years, Gopal marries and gets a child.

His friend Moti having

not acquired enough education, earns living by plying a Tonga. Both Gopal and Moti are
very much attached to each other. They are bosom friends. Gopal's wife, however. does
not like her husband’s association with a tonga driver and she resents Moti’s presence

in her house. One day when Moti had finished his dinner, Gopal’s wife refuses to cleanse
the utensiles, Gopal becomes furious and

loses his balance.

He rants and

frets and

fumes. But suddenly he is reminded of his vow and cools down, lest, he thinks, he
should also become a lunatic like his father.

Realising the gravity of the situation, Gopal's wife falls at her husband's feet and
craves his pardon. Gopal becomes normal and the whole family rejoice at this happy end.
