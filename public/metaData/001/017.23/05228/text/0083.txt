The dawn ’5

ﬁrst date

This, their ﬁrst child, has opened a new way of life full ofsunshine, laughter and happiness.
And for her: the dawn’s ﬁrst
dew — the very best of everything. These are the years when
her parents will give her the
care she needs.

Children need the right food
to grow and to help build immunity to diseases, but a casual

knowledge of nutrition is not
sufﬁcient. The health, growth
and well-being of your child
depend on a well-balanced diet—a diet only your doctor can
determine.
Let his knowledge and ex-

perience help you to safeguard
your child’s future. Always—aa
