I believe, however,

that there must be a place

where Festivals can be celebrated. And Theat?
rical Festivals can be best given in a good
theatre.

We have no adequate theatres in the

country, because the problems of theatre con-

struction have not been thought out yet.

The~

spirit of Indian drama is probably different
from that of the European and American three-act

play.

So we need a different kind of construc—

tion to perform our plays.
