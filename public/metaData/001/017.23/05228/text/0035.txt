south. A large tank, Sursagar, buiid in the l8th century and used for boating and
swimming lies on the western side of the road, while on the east small stalls, shops,
lodging and boarding houses, cinemas. etc. overcrowd the scene. At the southern end
of this road rises a stately building, the Nyaya Mandir. It is a massive construction, in
mixed lndo-Sarcenic and European style. with large courts and a ﬁne central hall which
is used as a town hall on many occasions. Here is a marble statue of Chimnabai. the
ﬁrst queen of Sir Sayaji Rao Ill.
