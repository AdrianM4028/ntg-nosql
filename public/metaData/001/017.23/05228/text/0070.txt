RANGBHOOMI came into existence eleven years ago as a movement wedded
to the utilisation of the long-neglected medium of the stage art for the propagation of
the progressive currents of the post-indepent era. A handful of stage enthusiasts
formed the nuclcus, which has now grown into a formidable and useful organisation.
During the last eleven years, it has fought superstition. casteisrn and communal
and linguistic fanaticism through the potent and powerful medium of the stage.
Rangbhoorni has staged about 25 full-length plays and another 50 one—act plays.
The choice of themes for this plays have been dictated by consideration of entertainment,
enlightenment and furtherance of human values.

The organisation has taken part in or organised various seminars, lectures and
interesting discourses by learned authorities on various aspects of play writing, production, back stage organisation

etc.

It also convened a unique Theatre meet—the The

Natya Milan in December I957 the first systematically arranged conference where
various organisations workers, authors, critics and stage lovers gathered on the
same platform to discuss mutual problems.
