THE ALEMBIC’ STORY
In the beginning, back in I903, it was a very small factory at Parel, Bombay.
Professor T.K. Gajjar used it mostly as his laboratory for experiments in the manufacture
of pharmaceuticals, toilet preparations and chemicals based on the use of spirit. As
larger quantities of spirit came to be called for, a factory had to be set up. Baroda
was chosen as the site and a public limited company was set up on 30th July I907,
The Company was called “Alembic”.
Two of the Professor’s disciples, Shri A. S. Kotibhaskar and Shri B. D. Amin
who had been

associated

with

him from the

start of his venture in Parel, were now

also to be the main pillars of Alembic.
Through the turbulent period of the First World War and the restless years
upto the early I930's Alembic struggled, often against the then Government, to establish
itself on a sound basis in the pharmaceutical industry. Along the way in those hard
years two of the founders died, Shri Kotibhaskar at the early age of 33 in I9IO, while
Professor Gajjar passed away in I920. Between I920 and I934 the burden of running
this enterprise and bringing efficiency to its operation fell squarely on the shoulders of
Shri B. D. Amin alone.
In I934 Alembic had new blood infused into it when
Shri R. B. Amin joined the Company.
