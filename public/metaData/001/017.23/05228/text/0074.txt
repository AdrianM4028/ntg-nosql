politics. With his money he imagines he can buy anything and anybody.

dummy director and stooge for tax evasion and signs anything put before her without
question. With Junawala, is his lawyer, a former legal light now ruined by drink. but

who has never been quite bought by the big businessman. He tries to lobby for influence

educated. A keen young journalist, out for copy. interviews him but gets little out of
him. Junawala finally picks this young man to educate Baby. The first act ends with
the beginning of her education—only the young man discovers he is going to be
"educated" too!
The second act starts two months later. Metamorphosis of Baby is in full swing.
She has surrounded herself with educational and cultural objects and books. She now
asks awkward questions about the documents the lawyer has her to sign. At the same

time a romance develops between herself and the journalist all of which leads up to the
inevitable exposure and finally to the victory of love and knowledge against ignorance
