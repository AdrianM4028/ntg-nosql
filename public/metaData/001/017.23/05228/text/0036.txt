the old town. At cardinal points, about two furlongs from it stands a gateway. The
Northern gateway is the Charnpaner gate. On this road the old palace, the Central
Library, main office of the Bank of Baroda and Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya are situated.
Outside the Champaner gate to the east are fine tanks—the Sarasia, the Vadi-Vadi and
the Varasia. Here the Military parade ground constructed by Khanderao Gaekwad is
situated. The road passes near the aerodrome and goes to Champaner and Pawagadh.
The gate on the east is the Pani-gate. On this road is situated the Najarbag,
a palace built by Malharrao Gaekwad. Opposite this palace is a hospital named after
Jamanabai, the wife of Khanderao Gaekwad. Near the Pam—gate is the old palace
called Bhadra. It has a beautiful marble window. This building is now used as the
office of various departments of the Gujarat State. Behind this palace is the Agad.
