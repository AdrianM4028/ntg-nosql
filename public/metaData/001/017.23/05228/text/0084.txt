हुँक्योंत'छ People and
THE SANTALS of Dravidian origin, who
originally settled in the eastern part of Bihar,

are a cheerful people. Most of them work as
labourers in factories and in the mines and
qu a rri es.

The women usually wear a white sari with a
border of Indian Red, one end wound tightly
round the body to form a skirt, and the
remainder crossed over the left shoulder and
tucked in at the waist. The red border, as it

follows the sweep of the sari, forms an attractive pattern emphasizing the graceful carriage
of these women.

Textile Manufacturing - which is one
of India's largest industries, has been
the foundation on which many other
of our industries have been built. The

Tata Group of Textile Mills, employing
over 23,000 workers, together with the

others in this industry seek today to
meet one of the basic needs of all

classes of people in the country.
