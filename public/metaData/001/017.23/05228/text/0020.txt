all the members of the Drama-Festival Ccmmittee for their valuable cooperation at
every needful occasion and sharing willingly heavy responsibilities,

We take this opportunity to thank the President of the Barcda Municipality.
The University authorities, the District Collector and the D. S. P. who have willingly
extended their helping hand by granting us all necessary facilities for the Festival.
The urgent need while sponsoring this Festival was - Finance. and we are highly
indebted to our Donors and Advertisers for encouraging us.

Some one said the other day, that we have ‘Taxed more’ the citizens of Baroda.
Yes — we do not deny. But look here, the citizens of Baroda have not ‘evaded the
tax’, but have willingly come forward with handsome donations to make the Drama
Festival a great success.

We are really thankful to all the Theatre organisations. who have accepted our
