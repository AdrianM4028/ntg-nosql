embodies the essence of the folk
spirit which celebrates life spontaneously and with full abandon.

The identiﬁcation of Mena with
Mother Kali, her being worshipped
as such, is, to me, neither a
superstition nor a mystery. The

strong will power and extraordinary
patience of Mena as she faces the
Badshah and later her own people,
are not miracles. They are
expressions of her impeccable spirit
which is reﬁned through meditation
and concentration. Her deep faith
and power make her synonymous

with Shakti. My production is an
aﬂirmation of that energy which
has found expression in the

perf'ormer’s rhythmic dance movements, lilting songs and colourful

compositions.
