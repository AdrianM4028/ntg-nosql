THE DIRECTOR

Bharat Dave, born on August 16,

1948, is a promising young theatre
director from Ahmedabad. Although
he took his MA. degree in
Economics and Bachelor degree in
Law, his fascination for the theatre

persisted and he became seriously
involved with it in the early
seventies. He worked with the
Bombay Television for a year before

doing a one year course in Dramatics
from Natya Sangh, Bombay. He

later joined the National School of
Drama from where he graduated

in 1976. During the same period his
deep interest in music led him to
join a three year course in vocal

music and sitar-playing at
Gandharva Mahavidyalaya in
Delhi.

Since 1977 he has been working as
a Television Producer at the I.S.R.O.
Ahmedabad. His stage activities
continue unabated. He has formed

a theatre group called Saptasindlm
and also edits and publishes a
monthly theatre bulletin named

after his group.
The plays he has produced and
directed include Moliere‘s
That Scoundrel Seapin, Sharad
Babu’s Vijaya, Tom Sroppard’s

Albert’s Bridge and If You’re Glad,
I’ll Be Frank, Dr. Lal’s Vyaktigat,
Euripedes’ Medea, two one-act
plays by Robert Anderson and four

one-act plays by Shrikant Shah.
