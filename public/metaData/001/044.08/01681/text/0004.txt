TH E PLAY
“When there is realisation; when the themes are felt and art lives, it is of no moment

whether or not the themes are new or old." Anand Koornara Swamy.
In Swapana-Vasavadatta we have such a play; one which deals with the ﬁner

elements of devotion, love, sacriﬁce and gratitude. As in all Asiatic art, this play
represents an ideal world, a world idealised in the popular sense of the word; that
is, perfected or remoulded nearer to the heart’s desire. In Bhasa’s poetry, in the

original Sanskrit text, there lies the true fragrance of these elements.
“The True meaning of Life". What else could it be but the sum total of sheer
emotions .7 Bhasa depicted the ﬁner nuances of such feeling and emotions through
the idealised love of Udayana, Vasavadatta and Padmavati. Swapna-Vasavadatta is

a bouquet of ever-fragrant ﬂowers; those yet to blossom as well as those which are
in full bloom.
