Bhasa stands at the threshold of Sanskrit literature. He is the earliest in the long line
of Sanskrit dramatists, whose works have come down to us. The nearest possible
approximation for the date of Bhasa is the early 5th century, B.C. Bhasa’s personal

religion was the ancient Pancaratra school of Vaisnavisrn.

Bhasa is the ﬁrst Sanskrit dramatist whose works have come down to us intact.
There are thirteen of them. Six short pieces based on the great epic Mahabharata,
like Urubhanga and Karnabhara, are among them. Abhisheka Nataka and Pratirna
Nataka are based on Ramayana. l’ratinjyaugandharayana & Swapanavasavadatta are
based on the life of king Udayana; Avirnaraka & Charudatta are plays based on

legend. Bhasa was a proliﬁc writer of the period. His dramas came to be known as
‘Bhasa Natakchakra’

Bhasa’s survival does not depend on the weight of numbers. Some of the mature
plays, like Swapnavasavadatta, can easily be compared to the best in the world for
its pure dramatic qualities. His thirteen preserved plays present extraordinary

diversity of form & technique.
