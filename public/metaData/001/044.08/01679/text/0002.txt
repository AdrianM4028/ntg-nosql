Prahasana and BhageVegejjukem_

Deepite a graceful description in Natya
Shastra of Prahasana as one among the
Dasaroopakas, no play as a model is extant.
Nor there appears to have been any serious
criticism of ﬁrahasana or even Bhana, for

that matter.

If the absence of action and

obscenety of language were not condemned by
an inclination toward refinement of taste,

it would perhaps have been possible to treat
them at par with the reﬁt of the Dasaroopakas,'
and to argue in,faucur of their being the
bases for the elevated works of Bhasa or
‘Kalidasa, for so were the early'éheek comedies
and satyres, bet, for better reasons, enjoyed
recognition bygthe Cultured, too.

However, Bhagavadajjukam, surmised to
belong to the ‘iﬂgﬁentury, and its authorship
ascribed to Bodhayana, though a Prahasana in
effect, is distinctly different in structure

ram and in ways independent of Bharata's
delineation.
