Furor, flight of mourning
and death and anger,
until the tears and grief now gathered,
until the words and the

fainting and the anger

are only a pile of bones in a road
and a stone buried by the dust.
It is so much, so many
tombs, so much martyrdom, so much
galloping of beasts in the star
Nothing, not even Victory
will erase the terrible hollow of blood
nothing, neither the sea, nor the passage
of sand and time, nor the geranium flaming
up on t h e grave.
-â€” P a b 1 o Neruda
