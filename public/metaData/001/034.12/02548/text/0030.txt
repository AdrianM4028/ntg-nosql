THE PLAY

BARABBAS
by A M AL ROY
Barabbas was the unfortunate character who was released in place of Jesus Christ and in lieu
of whom the “Messiah” was cruciﬁed. So says the gospel.
But for the sake of drarnatics the story goes on to state that he could never erase this incident
from his memory and that the teachings of Christ had a profound inﬂuence on him. When he
meets a slave girl who preaches Christianity unafraid of the Roman Law, he transforms from
ruthless dacoit to a human being full of love, poetry and emotions But his past clings to him
and there is no respite for him The girl he loves, turns him away and will not accept him as
he is indirectly responsible for the death of Christ. A shattered man, he tries his utmost to
break the shackles of sin but this15 not to be they capture the slave girl ............... try her for
treason and ﬁnally stone her to death.
Barabbas15 wild with rage and vows revenge. In his ﬁnal soliloquy he realises that before a
world of peace and love is established—injustice must be obliterated from the face of the earth
and this is possible only with the SWORD of BARABBAS.
