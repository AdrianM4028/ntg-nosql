THE PLAY

UTTARPURUSH
by TARIT KANTI MITRA

The drama revolves round a middle class family long settled in Delhi after f'ather Nalinakhha
shifted from Bangla Desh to the capital having taken job in Government ministry. The family
consisting of parents & one son & daughter had very close ties with one of their neighbours
while staying in Govt. quarter at Lodi Road and relation between Aditi & Shekhar grew
into love.

The two families were happily contemplating marriage of the two when thunder struck.
Shekhar lost both his legs in a scooter accident. Our drama begins at this juncture, eight
months after the accident.

The accident ript apart the middle class sentiments & every body is faced with naked
truth.

Every body is interprating it in its own way.

How Aditi reacts & decides to do about the situation is the late motif’f of the play.
