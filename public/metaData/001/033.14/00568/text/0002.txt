As we enter the thirty-sixth anniversary of the foundation of the

Lodi Road Bengalee Club, we bow in reverence to the pioneers who
were
lnstrurnental in establishing this Centre for Bengalees
in the Capital to nurse literary, social and other cultural activities away
from their homes. The very fact that the Club has survived through so
many years, speaks voluminously of its innate strength which is no doubt
due to hard work and dedicated devotion of its many members and
patrons, past and present,
In the earlier years this was the only Club of its kind in South
Delhi. With rapid expansion of Delhi and consequent increase in population during the last decade or so, there have been many other such centres
of activity. Even then, the Lodi Road Bengalee Club is known by all as an
lrnportant centre of culture in South Delhi.

During the last year, â€˜ the CIUb participated in various noteworthy
activities which have been stated/illustrated elsewhere in this brochure.
But the biggest event of recent years, as far as the Club is concerned, is,
of course, the drama entitled 'Chhutir Phande' scheduled to be staged by
local talents at AIFACS auditorium on 28th March, 1981. We hope it
will be enjoyed by those present on the occasion.
s and well
I take this opportunity to thank all our members, patron

Club.
wishers for their continued support to the activities of the
