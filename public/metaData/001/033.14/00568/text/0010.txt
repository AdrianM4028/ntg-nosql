The Dreadful Nightmare
Sunando Ghosh
Age 7 1 years

There is a man.
Who is standing there.
He had had a
Very bad nightmare;
In the nightmare
There was a ghost,
There was a cook,
And a host,
In come the ghost,
And away ran the host,
And the cook
With a hook
Got hold of the ghost
And tied him to a post,
But the ghost ran away
And ran to a lake

Which was gay

And got into a boat
Where a goat
Butted him hard on the back,
Which made his bones crack.
But when the man got up
He saw that the lake,
The ghost, cook and host
Were quite fake.
