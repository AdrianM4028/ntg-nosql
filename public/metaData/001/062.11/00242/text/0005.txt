same for all) which from time to time is discovered to be vain and disillusory
My art is full of bitter compassion for all those who deceive themselves, but
this compassion cannot fail to be followed by the ferocious dertsron of
destiny which condemns man to deception.
His main themes are : the necessity and the vanity of illusion, the multiform
appearances; all of them unreal. of what is presumed to be the truth, man
is not what he thinks he is, but he is "one, no one and" a hundred thousand”
accordingly as he appears to this person or that, and it is always different

from what he creates himself in his own mind Hence the supreme catastrophe
when a moral looking glass suddenly reveals to him the image of himself,
which others " see that is, what he is to others.

"It is impossible to know the real truth”

the play
HENRY IV is a drama in which we have a man who renounces his changing,
empty and vain existence to play the part ofa mad man, and pretends to
believe himself an historical personage, HENRY IV, All this might be merely

theatrical trickery if it were not seared by a deep anguish, characterizing a
philosophy which has destroyed all faith in the absolute, in reality, in any
ﬁxed limits outside individual personality
