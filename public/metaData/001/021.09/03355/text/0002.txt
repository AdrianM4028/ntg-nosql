ABOUT TH E PLAY
The obstinacy to turn this world into a global village has been making all-out
efforts to dilute the antagonism between 'haves' and ‘have-nots'. One and the
only aim is the working masses must lose the sight of their real class enemy.
In a situation when absence of the alternative politics becomes the ethos,
Sabse Udaas Kavita is an attempt to locate the ideological ground of the
people's struggle against coercion of the Power-that-be.
Apoorva is one of the many who refuse to accept the tyranny of the privileged
few as their destiny. A journalist, she is the agent of a long-awaited dawn.
Sukant, a doctor has serious reservations about her advocacy of extremism
and annihilation but the rampant cruelty leaves no room for his faith and
longing. Their love set the melody of a revolution in a time when dreams die
unnatural death and hopes are fake.
