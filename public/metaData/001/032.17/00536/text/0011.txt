I am very glad to learn that the Parvatiya Kala Kendra is producing the
complete Ramlila in Nov. ’85 at Delhi.
The Parvatiya Kala Kendra which is an organisation of Kumaon and

Garhwal hills has been doing excellent work in the ﬁeld of preservation and
presentation of the culture of that region. They have presented several folk
tales in ballad and ballet form and their experiments on the stage have been
highly successful.
I myself, have had a very Close and long association with the Kumaon and
Garhwal hills. I spent quite a long period of my childhood with my brother,
Dharma Viraji, who was posted to the Kumaon and Garhwal hills in his early
career as a District Magistrate, and my father who was fond of visiting Kumaon
Hills, and I have very happy memories of those times. We used to enjoy the
cultural programmes of the folk artists of that area with great enthusiasm.
I still have vivid recollections of those performances, particularly of some
ﬂute players whose tones are still ringing in my ears.
I have also been closely associated in the presentation of the Ramlila in
India and abroad. I am very happy to learn that the Parvatiya Kala Kendra
is experimenting with the “Sampoorna Ramayana” in the Kumaon folk style.

I am sure that this production will be beautifully presented and I wish the
Parvatiya Kala Kendra and the organisers all success on this occasion.
