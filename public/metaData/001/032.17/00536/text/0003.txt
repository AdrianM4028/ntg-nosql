INDIA
NEW D ELH I

I am glad to learn that the Parvatiya Kala Kendra, Delhi, is to
present a
three-day ‘Ramlila’ in November this year.
The Kumaon and Garhwal regions are unique in that they have
enriched
our classical as well as folk traditions of art. If this region has contrib
uted the
famed raag ‘Pahadi’ to classical Hindustani music, it has also preserv
ed a
vibrant folk art tradition through the centuries. The life-story of
the Prince of

Ayodhya lends itself to both forms of articulation. Sri Rama and Sita live
vitally for every Indian through representations in one or the other artistic
medium be it the printed page, the musical note or the living theatre.
I extend my best wishes to the Kendra for the success of its forthcoming

representation of this immortal saga.
