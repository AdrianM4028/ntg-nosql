SOME PRES S COMMENTS
Parvatiya Kala Kendra off to good start
People from the central Himalayan region, now living in Delhi, have at last
...f'ormed the Parvatiya Kala Kendra, a cultural organisation of the hill people.
They had a good start by having Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as the chief

guest at the first cultural performance.

Colourful Songs and Dances
A well-organized programme of Kumaon and Garhwal folk songs and dances
was presented by Parvatiya Kala Kendra, Delhi, on Monday evening, at Kamani
Auditorium, New Delhi. The President attended it.

A rare treat for theatre-goers
Seldom have I seen an audience so totally involved as that ﬁlled the Kamani
Auditorium f'or Kala Kendra’s production of Rajula-Malushahi. For the
Kumaonis in the Capital it was an event to see, enacted in two-and-a—half hours
a ballad that is usually sung in 21 hours spread over seven days. For the regular
theatre-goers it was indeed an evening to remember.
The Times of India (March 6, 1981)
Opera as it should be
Parvatiya Kala Kendra’s presentation of ‘Ajuwa Bafaul’, an heroic ballad from
the Kurnaon region of Uttarakhand is what an opera should be in the Indian
context ......

The Times of India (October 5, 1982)

Folk ballad to evoke spirits of Pandavas

Parvatiya Kala Kendra’s latest opera “Mahabharata” ...... was in the style of
Pandav Jagar...The vitality of form, evocative music, facinating costumes and
scenic effects...captivated the audience. It sought to illustrate the anti-war
thesis...
