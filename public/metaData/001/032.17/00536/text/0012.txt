Parvatiya Kala Kendra has been doing yeornan service for the arts of the
Himalayan region, particularly U.P. hills. The Himalayan mountain ranges of
UP. are not only the home of the great Himalayan peaks—Kedar, Badri, Trishul

and Nandadevi, they are the source of great rivers Ganga and Yamuna.

These

peaks mythically have been considered the centre of the Universe Maha Meru.
The rivers are the eternal waters of fertility. The forests have been keepers of
the ecological balance. The three together have provided the natural
environment for the creative genius of the people of these hills. Primodial
myths connected with the environment have been given a new shape and form
through legend and folk lore.

Time and again, the Parvatiya Kala Kendra has drawn from this tradition
and has presented before us a wide spectrum. I am glad that this time they have
chosen a theme which is eternal, pervasive and yet one which has received
repeated reinterpretation in diﬁerent regions and through different languages and
in different epochs. The U.P. hill region Ramayana has its particular ﬂavour.
I have no doubt that the Parvatiya Kala Kendra will present the essence of the
message through their distinctive idiom.
