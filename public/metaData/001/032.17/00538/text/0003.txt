Among the many folk ballads still
sung in Kumaun and Garhwal hills,
Malushahi has the widest appeal. The
ballad sings of the love of Rajula, the
only daughter of Sunpati Shauka, a
trader from the lndo-Tibetan border,
for Malushahi, the King of Bairaath, a
colourful land situated in the lower
altitudes of Kumaun hills.

Conflict

arises. because Rajula is already betrothed to a Tibetan prince. Since
three distinct ethnic groups are involved in the story, action shifting from
one area to another, the ballad has

taken on pastoral character, which
gets reflected in the entire style of its
of
narration. Music gives a feeling
continuous movement and uninterrupted flow.

The tunes used in the songs

been meticulously kept confined with
in the bounds of the folk musical tra-

dition of that region. However, some
liberty has been taken with regard to
the choice of instruments. To Sarangi

Er flute, which form part of the folk
instrumental repertoire, Sarod and
Violin have been added with a view
to augmenting the mood and atmosphere of the story.
