Dear Shir Upreti,
I' am glad to know that the Parvatiya Kala
Kendra is continuing its good work by the
presentation of another balled ’Ajuwa Bafaul'
on September 29, 30 and October 1 st,

1982

at Karnani Hall, New Delhi. I have no doubt
that through this artistic spectactle the
Parvatiya Kala Kendra will be able to stimulate interest and evoke respect for the rich

and inspiring cultural heritage of the hill
regions of India.
