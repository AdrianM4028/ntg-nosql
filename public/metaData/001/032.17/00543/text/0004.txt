Dear Shri Upreti,
I am happy to hear that the Parvatiya Kala Kendra
is presenting “Ajuwa Bafaul" later this month in
New Delhi. This will give yet another opportunity
to the spectators in the capital

to experience the

vigour and charm of folk theatre at first hand.
I send you my good wishes.

W i t h regards,

Yours sincerely,

( P .V. N a ra s i m h a R a o )
