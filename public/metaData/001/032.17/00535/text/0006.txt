MA SS AGE
I am delighted to learn that Parvitaya Kala Kendra of which Shri Mohan Upreti
is the moving spirit has completed twenty fruitful years of its existence as a leading
centre of Indian folk art and culture with special focus on Uttarakhand. To the best
of my knowledge such a centre dedicated to the preservation and recreation of folk
art and culture suited to the modern context does not exist elsewhere. It is
unmatched in the contribution that it has already made to a new cultural renaissance
in India which derives its sustenance from the rich heritage of the common peasants
and artisans of India. Moreover this centre has entered a new creative path by
presenting in a modern form the great folk epics and ballads and by introducing the

urban educated intelligentsia to new sources of spiritual regeneration and enrichment.
It has been my proud privilege to see Shri Mohan Upreti, the friend of my
younger days, to grow and mature into a cultural leader of Uttarakhand and on
that basis also to emerge as a creative individual of all-India eminence. Members of
his group have also grown and each of them has acquired a stature of his or her
own. There is no greater joy in life than to be creative and to win the sincere and

deep affection and appreciation of one’s own people through one’s work.
I offer Parvitaya Kala Kendra, Shri Mohan Upreti and his colleagues my sincerest
congratuations and greetings. I wish them greater achievements and successes in the

ﬁeld of folk culture.
