Haf'ira (Gujarat), the world’s largest cooperative fertiliser project. And in its very
ﬁrst year of operation, the plant had achieved 97. 1% capacity utilisation—a record
for any ammonia-ures plant, anywhere in the world.

KRIBHCO’S marketing network is spread over 14 states in the country.
Its Krishak Bharati Sewa Kendras provide farmers with all inputs under one roof——

certiﬁed seeds, quality fertilisers, plant protection, chemicals, literature. etc. Not
only that, the Society actively promotes the all-round development of backward

training and extension activities. Helping the farmers to grow more and earn more.
And strengthening the cooperative in the process. Which is exactly what KRIBHCO
is committed to.
