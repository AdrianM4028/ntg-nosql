Dear Shri Upreti,

I am happy to learn that the ‘Parvatiya Kala Kendra’ is going to stage the
" famous Uttar'akhand ballad 'Jeetu Bagdwal’. The Kendra has done pioneering
work in presenting the dances, dramas and operas of Uttarakhand to audiences

in Delhi and elsewhere in a form which lends itself to modern stage-craft.
. I wish the programme all success and accord my heart-felt greetings to the

organisers and all the artists on the occasion.

Yours sincerely,
(K .C. PANT)

Shri Mohan Upreti
President,
