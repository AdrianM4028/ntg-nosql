Dear Sir,

Kindly refer to your letter dated September, 1986, inviting the Hon’ble
Chief Minister to witness the famous Uttarakhand ballad “Jeetu Bagdwal” being
staged by Parvatiya Kala Kendra at Delhi from 26th September, 1986.

In this connection, I am desired to say that due to engagements already
ﬁxed for this period, Hon’ble Chief Minister would not be able to witness the

above ballad, which is very much regretted.
Hon’ble Chief Minister wishes all success to your programme.

Yours sincerely,

Sd /(N.K . KEW A LRAM ANI)

Sri Mohan Upreti
President,

Parvatiya Kala Kendra,
Rana Bhawan, R-23, Indrapuri,
