My dear Mohan,
Your letter dated 9th Sept. about the Parvatiya Kala Kendra is before me

on my return from a tour of Garhwal and Charnoli.
I am happy to note that the Kendra has, under your dynamic leadership,

grown into a “major cultural force”. My services, for what they are worth, are
with you in furthering the cause for which the Kendra is working.

It will be indeed my pleasure to be with you on the last day of the staging
of the Uttarakhand ballad “Jeetu Bagdwal”. Please accept my good wishes
for a very successful presentation of the proposed item.
With greetings,

Yours sincerely,
(H. N. BAH UGUNA)

Shri Mohan Upreti
President
Parvatiya Kala Kendra
