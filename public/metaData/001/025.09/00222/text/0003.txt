Dear friends :

We would like to introduce you our group first of all. Our group named
“Gulistan” had been formed in 1976 for the objective to promote Indian art,
literature add culture. Gulistan is a purely amateur group and it has a band of
stage artists, writers. poets, musicians and others : most of them being Government servants. They spare their time and extend honorary service to the group.

Gulistan believes in the ideology that equal opportunities should be
given to all so that a person can develop his personality according to his own
way.

Gulistan is an end in itself to fulfil this commitment.

And we introduce ourselves practically among the audience of the
capital with our maiden

stage production “TARAQQI”.

It is a two act social

satire in Hindi, written and directed by Gulshan Dehlavi.

We welcome you all here and earnestly hope that you would certainly

like our maiden adventure.
