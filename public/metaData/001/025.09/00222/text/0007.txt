the main
character in this play. He is idealist and his main tussle
is with his wife, who
is a materialist'and wants to fulfil her desires by any hook or crook. The
father is a railway clerk in Delhi and is transferred to Bombay due
to his
"ideals". Then there is a gap of about 10 years. In these
years his only
daughter and only son become young. They are brought up accordin
g to the
desires of their mother.
With the result, the daughter becomes call-girl and

the son thief and drunkard. But the mother is happy with the progress
achieved by foul means. Father comes back to Delhi after his prematur
e
retirement.

He is not welcomed by his family. The reason being that he is
"too idealist" and ideals come in their free life.
The outcome is again tussle
between him and his whole family. The climax comes when he tries to help

a girl who is a victim of his son. And in this struggle he has to
and even to lose his life, because he connot bear the injustice.
