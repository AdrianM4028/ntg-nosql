Tamasha has been formed by a group of Drama Lovers in Delhi.
Belonging to various professions ranging from Financial Managment
to Journalism, they aim at fostering and deepening interest in Drama.
We do not just produce plays now and then. We have ventured
forth into a wider effort to promote theatre and involve young people
in it. We opened up with a children theatre workshop in 1980 at
South Delhi. The workshop was followed up, based on training of the
young participants and improvisation, by a short hilarious comedy
'HU M BADE J HOOTH E HAIN’. It was liked very much by young and
old alike tremendously.
The play ’Andhon ka Haathi' which is now being staged is another

outcome of our second-one month long - workshop. Our workshop
will be concluded, with this play. Except for one, no one fromthe
cast of this play has really appeared on stage earlier. This itself
speaks for our efforts and the contribution we are making forthe
promotion of drama.

The objectives of Tarnasha is to find talent all around-among playwrights for original Indian plays and for translating plays from Indian

rewarding. We feel there

children theatre.

A non - commercial institution ‘ TAMASHA ’ invites you all to

associate with it and become its members.
