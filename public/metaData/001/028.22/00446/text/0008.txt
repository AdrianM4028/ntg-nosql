tamasha

Formed in December 1980, by a small group of Drama lovers,
belonging to various professions, ﬁnancial Management to Journalism.
Aim to nurture and deepen interest in Drama.

Within a year we have a membership of over one hundred.
To begin with, a children’s theatre workshop was launched in
South Delhi. This ended in a short hilarious comedy called “HUM
BADE JHOOTE HAlN”, as a result of the training received by
t he young on es.

In May — June 198], a young people’s theatre workshop was
launched. This was followed by performances of “And hon Ka Haathi”,
a satire by Sharad Joshi at the Shri Ram Centre. The workshop and
consequent performances were not only very successful, but a significant step towards promoting the culture through drama, as none of

the participating people had ever appeared on stage before, except for
one. The shows at the Shri Ram Centre went House Full.
One of our main objectives is to ﬁnd talent among playwrights
for original plays. Keeping this in mind, we have brought forth an
Original “Anamghar” before you.

A Non Commercial institution “Tamasha” invites you to associate
with it .
