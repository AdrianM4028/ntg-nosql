. . ~. Directors’ Note
Being very close to the author of the play,

I‘ had not perceived

that the play would be much of a challange for my nerves. I had
already acquired to a large extent the gist and spirit of the characters
portrayed in the script !
i really regret having thought so.
During rehearsals I found out why. To mention a few of the
problems—the author has relied very heavily on long speeches.
Although they go down well while reading the play, enactment makes
the other characters who are not speaking at that time, quite static.

So one actor keeps speaking while the other actor is waiting for his
turn to come. I was also surprised to note that during some scenes
a certain character was completely missing, when he or she was the
focal point of discussion among the other characters present.
Moreover, my cast belonged to all parts of the country, there-

fore giving different dimensions to the characters according to their
own up-brlngings, personalities. beliefs and egos. In the beginings was
at a complete loss to understand why a gap was showing through, (not

the generation gap as suggested by the author) but a gap between the
conception of the author and the actor. I soon realized this was due
to their own frame of mind and the stiffness of the characters as

suggested by the author.

l have therefore, allowed them to adjust

according to their owg values, without damaging the real spirit of
the characters.

Here before you is the end product then. But not, I might add
without the “laboured pain” borne during the birth of a production.
