PASHU TA is a play with high emotional impact and a director's
dream-come-true. The first time I read this play I felt palpitation's in my heart

and I knew I could not rest till I got this play out of my system.
The role of a nymphomaniac mother was a real search for a powerful actress who could go through the full range of emotion's. and my search

well as over the audio system called for real acting talent and Akhil

in the

Combined role of Robin the retarded boy, as well as MICAHEL the father,
does full justice to the role.
VEENA MALHOl RA as Linda has to put in a lot of acting talent to
match with Manju as her mother and she comes off well.
