(SynOpsis of the Hindi play to be staged by VIPLAV on 4th May, 1976)

'Adamkhor means man eator. The play starts informing the audience
of some disaster the city had. It seemed the whole civilization was swept

in

the natural calamity.

Two persons who represented the civilized upper strata of the society
survived the wrath. They met each other near the sea. It was a question of
survival for them. They found nothing to eat. Their civilized background in the

face of misry was put to test. They indulged in the uncivilized acts. Perhaps all
their life they had been wearing the mask of culture and now their real
character is revealed.
In the past they thrived on the labour and toil of others. Now when

they were to attend to their primary needs of even finding food for themselves
they were proved incapable. They discovred the food but could not toil to
get that.
A labourer passes through that wap'enroute to his village. They caught

hold of him and demanded food. The labourer who himself was hungry
arranged food for them. What did they give him in return ?
/

The plae tries to depict the characters we meet in our daily life. The
grief and sufferings of the cornrnonrnan and the ivory tower approach of
the elite.
