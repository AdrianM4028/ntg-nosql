The initial tone suggests that personal merits or an individual
matter a lot though poverty is the epitome of all the vices. Charudatta,
the hero is an impoverished Brahman merchant whom Vasantsena the
prostitute adores for the human excellence in his personality. The
triangle is complete when Mama (Shakar, the king’s broth-er-inulawlooser) chases Vasantsena voluptuously. She evidences heroic conﬁdence

and worldly wisdom as she does also when Charudatta’s son is crying
of a golden cart. She bemuses him by covering the Clay Cart with her

gold ornaments.
In her bid to escape Vasantsena enters Charudatta’s house and
deposits with him her ornaments the villain might rob her of. The

ornaments are stolen by Shyam to fulﬁl the conditions leading to his

marriage with Mandi, Vasantsena’s maid.
The ornaments complete the circle when they reach to Vasantsena
who recognises them. Worried of his reputation for honesty, Charudatta
sends his own ornaments to Vasantsena.

There is a comedy of error when GOpal the
Charudatta's cart waiting for Vasantsena and

rebel escapes in

Vasantsena sits in the

villain’s cart. Mama the villain strangles Vasantsena in the garden when
all his amorous solicitations fail.
He approaches the court accusing Charudatta for the murder.

Vasantsena dramatically appears alive. There is much more in the live
enactment theatre off’ers.
