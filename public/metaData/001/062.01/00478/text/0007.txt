T R A N S L A T O R ’ 5 NOTE
The plays I chose to translate represent one of
the modern trends in Hungarian theatre—the use
of the absurd not for the sake of the absurd but to
provide meaning to a social situation. The translations have been made from the English language.
Dr. Wojtilla, professor of Hungarian Language in
the University of Delhi very kindly helped me in
comprehending the subtitles of the Hungarian mind
and culture as reflected in the original. There are
straight translations for l have not attempted to
adapt the plays in anyway. I did not find it
necessary to do so. The subtle humour and irony
in the plays is best reflected in typical Hungarian
situations in which it was discovered by the
authors and is universal in its quality. In evidence
it is closer to the Indian ethos than some other
European varieties of humour.

Hungarian language is capable of subtle experiences and has fine nuances. I cannot claim to
have succeeded in communicating all of them fully
to the Hindi reader. I can only say that l have
enjoyed trying to be faithful to the spirits of the
plays. If I succeed partly in sharing the experience

with the reader and the viewer,
myself well rewarded.
