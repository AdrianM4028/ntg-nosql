In the five year old life of the Hungarian
Information and Cultural Centre or even more in the
history of the contemporary Hungarian drama and in
the life of the typical Indian stage art, the today's
programme can be dUer deemed as a mile-stone.
The modern Hungarian drama which made its
debute with grand success in Europe long ago—
from Moscow to London and from Rome to
Oslo—and in overseas as well, finally struck its
root in India and may start its career—~Nota Bene
in Hindi I -——by the outstanding translation work of
Raghuvir Sahay.
Heema Sahay and Ashok IViishra directed for
stage a one act play, Ferenc Karinthy's “Hot Air".
This play is on stage these days in Hungary too
and this two-men show now is the try-and-errorperformance of the appearance of the Hungarian
drama in India.

The actors made a tremendous job who, beside
drawing a sketch of sequences of typical Hunga-

rian problems and thoughts/ideas, are able to carry
the universal human message of the play.

Luckly the directors succeeded in finding actors
of different acting technique; one of them is closer
to the European acting style while the other has his
roots in the traditional Indian stage heritage. Under
these circumstances the directors could underline
the diverse characters of the figures as well.
While wishing this small enthusiastic group of
four every success we are deeply convinced that
the today’s programme of the H ICC will introduce
a new face of the Hungarian literature by the fullfledged support of our Indian friends.
