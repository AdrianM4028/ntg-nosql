DIRECTORS’ N OT E
’Hot Air' is a difficult play. It has a serious
theme while the situation in the play is comical.
There are only two characters. The dialogue between the two characters is in a fast tempo and is
full of sharp and sometimes cruel wit. The characters express their individual tensions and use their
intelligence to force each other to share the suffering inside the hot air chamber. Yet they are not
willing to see that both of them are victims of their
own egos. Both the characters however sustain a
hidden sympathy for each other while apparently
taking a sadistic pleasure in each other predica—
ment.

We chose to do away with the proscenium in
this play. The idea was to involve the audience
with the situation inside the Hot air chamber. The
play is staged in the centre of the auditorium
which is supposed to be the Hot Air chamber itself.
The other sections of the Turkish Bath are supposed to be located elsewhere in the building. The
set is designed to create an illusion of the hot air
chamber with the minimum of material and cost
and is flexible enough to be adapted to suit any
theatre. The focus is on the speech and movement
of the actors.
We are irnrnencely thankful to the members and
staff of the Centre for the encouragement given
and facilities provided by them. Thanks are due
especially to Mrs. and Mr. Csikos for the constant
help they gave in the interpretation and visualiza—

tion of the play.
