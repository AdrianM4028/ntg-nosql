Director's Note

Aaydaan is an autobiography of a Dalit
Woman

About the Play

Aaydaan is a name for articles made from
bamboo â€” trays, baskets, straw remover,
flower basket, hand fan. And so on.

Born in a Dalit family, Urmila grew up in
Konkan. She is aware of being born a Dalit.
At a later stage, her realisation of being

born a woman raises her consciousness to
another level. Urmila travels this journey
and documents it with wry humour. She
gains strength because of this journey. Like
Aaydaan, Urmila weaves through words,
the life stories of many Urmilas, Vimalas,

Sushilas, who represent a Dalit woman.
Almost all women.The lives of many
women unfold through an autobiography
whose story needs to be told.

Urmila

Pawar,

a

representative

story of a rural girl. Urmila's mother was an
excellent weaver of Aaydaan which are
articles made out of very thin strips of cane
wood (Bamboo) woven together. Fascinated
by her mother's way of weaving, Urmila
started weaving the words through her
writings. She finds similarity as well a deep
connection in her mother's weaving and her
writing. Editing of the book Aaydaan was a
truly challenging task. While weaving
together significant scenes of Urmila's life, |

decided to have three female artists to
perform Aaydaan. Three artists play
multiple roles as Urmila and other
characters in Urmila's life. Weaving their
stage movements was an innovative &
interesting challenge.
And to create a texture of Aaydaan, I
thought of a set made of Bamboos. | feel
this is an innovative attempt in presenting
an autobiography on stage and would give
the audience a different experience.
