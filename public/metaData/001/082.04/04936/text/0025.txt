Director's Note

Is the fish trapped in greed for the bait? Or
is the fisherman in the greed for the fish?

Dhou...The Wave is a powerful story of a
lonely, wise old fisherman who conquers a
magnificent fish, endures the heart
breaking loss of it and rises gallantly above
his defeat. He is hero in deed and spirit, a

defeated but valiant man who has the
courage to try again. Furthermore this is the
story of companionship, the deep love and
respect that a young boy and old man hold
for each other. The play is not a theatrical
adaptation of the novel itself, but is new
interpretation of the novel, celebrating its
theme. A group of community living by
fishing in the eastern part of India has been
portrayed in the play with their unique
cultural heritage.
