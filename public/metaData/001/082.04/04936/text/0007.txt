META is turning ten replete with celebrations that will happen on the
27th of March 2015 when the Awards Night takes place in its normally
resplendent manner. Some theatre people will be elated at winning
the awards while others disappointed that they could not make it —
having come so near! However, the evening will continue with the
camaraderie and bonhornie that uniquely typifies the theatre culture,
no matter where you come from. There is a special theatre language,
you see?
Of course, this would be the culmination of a year long effort of hard

work and preparation by the theatre groups aspiring to be selected for
a META award. The preceding week would see the ten best
productions of the year performing in front of audiences and a select
panel of Jury Members, who would finally select the winners under
the different award categories.
META is turning ten, I said — it is only a child. One week later, I will turn
sixty! But unlike human beings, META is an institution which will last

forever. Not just last, it will grow, thrive and lead to increasingly higher
levels of creativity and excellence in performance values.
By supporting theatre we are helping to keep alive our cultural
heritage in one of the performing arts. META is playing a small part but
an important one in doing this - showing a beacon for others to follow.
