Over a period of much iterations, many
trials and errors, and a lot of collaboration

between the two scenographers, the light
designer, the costume designer, the sound
designer/ musician, the actors, the
production team, the dramaturg and the
director, we have tried to find interesting

ways of handling these challenges.
Kaumudi is still very much a work in
progress. Our rehearsals never try to create
the last performance as is, but the focus is
always on discovering something new even
if certain parts of the play become less
effective than before for a particular show.
Over the year or so of its opening, the play
has played in different kinds of venues,
from open air, to large auditoriurns to small
theatres and everywhere we have had to
find a way of delivering the epic scale of the
play within the play and the intimate
natu re of the rest of the play.
