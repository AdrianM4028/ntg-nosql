About the Play
Dreams from My Room is a short solo play.
It attempts to visualize the mental state of
people in a conflicted world. The play
emphasizes the psychology of the victims
in a traumatic world and their serious
emotions. An artist dreams from his
theatre room for a peaceful living but his
dreams could not change the reality of the
conflict world. The clashes between ethnic
groups and mass—killings increases the
number of child soldiers in different
conflict zones of this world and contributes
to the deterioration of human civilization.
The seriousness of minds leads to an
emotional ending.

expressions, trying to

interpret the

contemporary problems in a conflicting
world. The nature of the play is that of a
dark and horrific scenario. This play uses
the idea of self-induced schizophrenia or
multiple personality disorder as a way for
the psyche to cope with severe trauma.
There are dotted events within the testing
room to shake the minds and to retain a
level of seriousness, building up slowly to a
frantic, bizarre and emotional ending.
