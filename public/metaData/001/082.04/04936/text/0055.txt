sister, Shoorpanakhi, is seething to seek
revenge on Rama and appears on stage in

the Jogera episode in the form of a Koravanji
(a gypsy wife). She pretends to be Seetha's
childhood friend and gains entry into the
palace. She manages to convince Seetha
too about their childhood friendship and
eventually instigates Seetha to paint a
portrait of Ravana. The picture remains
incomplete without a Drishti (Vision) as
Seetha refuses to give vision to the painting.
She then manages to send Seetha away on
some pretext and gives vision to the picture

herself. Thus she becomes the reason for
Ravana's rebirth and this also marks the
beginning of strife in the relationship
between Rama and Seetha.

Though Seetha treats & fondles Ravana as
the child of her creation, she falls prey to
Rama's outrage. Seeing Seetha's insult,
Ravana opposes Rama. Along with
Laksharnana, Rama manages to overpower
Ravana. Rama seems small and Lakshrnana
insignificant in front of an infuriated Seetha
who is unable to bear the atrocity against
her son Ravana. Eventually affection &
motherhood win and jealousy &
ma liciousness lose.
