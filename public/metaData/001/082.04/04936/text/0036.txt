Best Actor in a Supporting Role

Matthi is a collective effort of the actors
along with the audience to play life itself. The
drama on the stage and theatre initiative
behind the drama together makes it unique.
The intention behind the design makes the
audience feel like as if they are part of the
celebrations, sorrows and unpredictable
interactions and changes. The nostalgia
surrounded over the play is not a clich√©
attempt to tickle the people, it is very
conscious application demanded by the
treatment as the same feel has to haunt you
at the end and follow after on. You may feel
what is deficient in the contemporary Indian
socio-political scenario. A representative of
the audience is posted among them to speak
and interact for them. The piercing smell of
cooking sardine throughout the play is an
added sense which will evoke hunger among
you. The sarcasm, satire and innocent words
of common man have more dimensions
beyond the peripheral meanings of the silly
small fish named sardine. The aesthetics of
love, romance, sex, celebrations, hard work,
rituals, death etc... are portrayed as it is
without any ornamentation, enacted by
nonprofessional common working class
people .
