Directed by: lino Joseph

The play develops through the perspective
of a small fresh fish merchant, Matthi

Language: Malayalam
Duration: 90 minutes

Rafeeq, who sells only sardines to houses.
He thinks selling and cooking sardines is just
like protesting against big fish. His small
house is the platform for the entire village to
gather every day where they make debates
on social issues, perform small plays of
revolution, share their innocent love and

care. Fried fresh sardines prepared by
Kunjami, the younger sister of Rafeeq is an
inevitable dish for all their get—togethers.

With the changed social situation, big fish
started to arrive from markets outside the
local area. Because of the devoid of his
livelihood, his love, Sheeba goes away in
search of job and Rafeeq loses the zeal for
life. The play ends up with a fantasy that the
olden golden village group of innocent
common people burst out for action from
the frozen cold storage when the smell of
frying sardines cooked by Appu, the village
boy and Kunjami together, pierce into their
nose. This play which interrningles love,
revolution and theatre, is an attempt to
recognize the importance of a cultural
unity in an ever changing world of invasion.
