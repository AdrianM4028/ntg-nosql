From all corners of India they came
To stake their claim at fame

To share their stories with the world
To see their talent unfurl

Theatre groups big and small

Traveled to the capital in zest
To compete with the nation’s best
To win the coveted META, to pass the test

As we celebrate this theatrical decade
The Mahindra Group too has claimed their stake

With benevolence and grace
Our role in this triumph we embrace

We are proud of our long term commitment

To an art form that deserves the best
With genuine interest and considered thought

We pledge our allegiance and our support

As we enhance the cultural fabric

Of the communities we serve with delight
As we scale the charts of admiration

Forever more, we will Rise.
