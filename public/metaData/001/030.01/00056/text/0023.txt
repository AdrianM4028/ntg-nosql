Once there lived a king who was very happy because he had everything. One
day his mother told him that he would be happier if he heard the Nightingale. The
happy king became sad and told his Vazier to bring the bird at any cost.

The Nightingale was brought to the palace and the king was happy again.
Later a merchant presented the king with a toy Nightinglae that sang beautifully.

The real Nightingale flew away.
After sometime the toy bird broke and the king was unhappy again.
Suddenly the Nightingale returned to the king's palace because she knew that
the king was unhappy.

On seeing the Nightingale the king was happy again.
