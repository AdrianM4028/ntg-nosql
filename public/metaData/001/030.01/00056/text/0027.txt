One day a red hen found some wheat, which she wanted
to sow.

ached her friends : duck, cat, dog and a pig for help

She appro-

Amazingly, none offered her

help.

Determined. the hen called all her chicks and together they
did the sowing.
The harvest was very good. When the hen prepared a pan-cake
out of wheat
powder, all her selfish friends wanted to share it. But the hen
refused to entertain
them. She made them understand that only those who worked
to produce can enjoy
the fruits. She then shared the pan-cake with the chicks.

Parde Uthne Se Pehle
(A play in Hindi )—by Dev Kala Mandir

Putting up a show is an uphill task. The director of a play often finds himself
in the most embarassing situations. One ill starred fellow launches on the task of
direction and is soon in trouble. All is set for a crucial rehearsal but the heroine

does not show-up.

He is in jitters thinking that the lady has forsaken him and his

play. There is only one way out, ask the wife to act out the heroine’s part. But she
refused to toe the line. He has to use all his beguiling manner to make her believe

that she can be a fantastic actress. At last she consents to act but, that is net the
end of the poor director's predicarnents because now the heroine too arrives on the
scene. The situation is aggravated further & the director is harassed more than ever.
But for our audience it means a rollicking comedy.

Once upon a tlrne a monkey and a peacock shared a piece of land which they

were supposed to hervest.

But as lazy as the monkey was he refused to work.

So

the peacock toiled and was ultimately rewarded with a rich harvest while the monkey
lost everything.

Hence. we learn that people ’working hard are always rewarded' .
