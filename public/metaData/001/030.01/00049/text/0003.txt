As Dewali approaches all children get excited about ﬁreworks and crackers. Similarly Deenu and Laxmi too wanted to have
their share of crackers. They told their mother to buy them some
but the mother was very poor and it was difﬁcult for her to make
both

ends meet and in disgust she loses her patience and beats them.
The children begin to cry. At that very moment Goddess Laxmi, who
was very pleased with their kindness and honesty
gave them strange
crackers to enjoy.
