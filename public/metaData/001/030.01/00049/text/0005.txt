The story of Drama is spun around a room of a Bungalow
owned by one Rai Bahadur. Rai Bahadur Badri Prasad is away
for a long time in search of his daughter who was lost at the age of
of four in the Kumbha Mela. The servants of Rai Bahadur are
looking after the Bungalow in his absence. With the intention
to earn money the servants let out the Room to two persons-a young
lady and a man. Both the tenants are not aware of each other’s presence in the Bungalow for some time as the young man goes out for

duty at night and the young lady gets back from duty sometime in the
evening.
One morning the young man is surprised to have discovered

the young lady is ...... Sorry, no more revelation at this stage. Instead
look at the stage where curtain on many more pleasant surprises will

be raised in the movement.

the world out of slumber. Lif'e returns to the world-manifesting itself
