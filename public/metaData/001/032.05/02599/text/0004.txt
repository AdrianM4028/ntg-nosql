of misunderstandings.
The story revolves round a docile girl who's
father with his dogmatic traditional behaviour
wants to marry the daughter and free himself
of the burden. The entire family joins the
joy of prepration of the clebration.
While these jubilation are at its peak the
situation takes a queer and filthy turn.

The

groom blinded by a petty rnisundarstanding
denounces the piousness of the bride and
announces to refrain from rnarying the girl.
The gloom prevails. The mansion of joy start
crumbling down. But the timly intervention
of a sensible man, the disaster is saved.
The one who had misunderstood is made to
understand and the finale is repentence. The
hot atmosphere is once again rent with cool
breeze of happiness.
