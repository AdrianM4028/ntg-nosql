has divested meaning away from the self of the
sayer and invested it in a gigantic and a-moral
saying machine. I am directing Agni aur Barkha
in this a-moral modern situation.

A-moralism and structured religion
This recent Kannada play of Girish Agni Mattu
Male, also called The Fire and The Rain in English,
and Agni Aur Barkha in Hindi, infact treats this

contemporary problematic of a-moralism as its central
theme. As the title suggests, Girish Karnad places
Yagna the fire, in opposition to rain the life.

’l‘alsi Ramayana or Rama Charita Manasa says
Prana Jaye Per Vachana Na Jaye. In saying thus
Tulsi Ramayana is merely trying to focus our attention
on the essential truthfulness of the uttered word.
According to Indian belief word as uttered, i.e.
Vachana is unalterable. Life, i.e. Prana, i.e. meaning,

rests solely in uttering a word and not in the
sanctified process of recording it. Such categorisation

of human expression between uttered word and
sanctified word, has had far reaching consequence
for humanity. We need to be reminded of this
contradiction between Vachana and Mantra because
the modern world in its quest for limitless growth

puts these opposites into the context of a brahminical
vedic tradition. As always his plot is far removed
from the modern times, but not necessarily modern
implications.
In order to understand the underlying
spiritual tension that shapes Agni aur Barkha
we shall have to re-examine the brahminical vedic
tradition. Veda is a holy text for hindus, and
brahmins are their clergymen. But unlike other

clergymen, brahmins are a caste from within the
hindu community. And veda, unlike other holy
texts is in itself the god and not merely a recorded
prophecy of the god.
