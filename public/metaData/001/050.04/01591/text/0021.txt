NATIONAL SCHOOL OF DRAMA
REPERTO RY
National School of Drama Repertory was
formed in 1964-65 on an experimental basis by
Shri E. Alkazi. In the beginning, it consisted of

only four actors. It later expanded into a larger
group of actors, musicians and technicians, mainly
drawn from graduates -of the National School of
Drama, Delhi. In 1964, late Shri Om Shivpuri led
the Company and later in 1977, Shri Manohar Singh
became the first full fledged chief of Repertory.
Over the years the Repertory has produced a
variety of plays ranging from stylised musicals to
realistic contemporary works of Indian drama to
translations and adaptations of foreign language
plays.
Eminent directors of national and
internatioal repute from within the country and

abroad have worked with the Company.

all over India and has made several successful trips
to Germany, Poland, Britain, Nepal, and Mauritius.
