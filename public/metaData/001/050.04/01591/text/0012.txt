Indian rnodernists have shuddered to touch
the romantic love, though I must acknowledge that
one finds glimpses of its hidden beauty in M.T.
Vasudevan Nair’s novel ’Choukattina Mane’ (The

Kannada title), and in a few other prose writing
in Indian bhasha literature.
A rebel brahmin is a cliche in Indian literature.
A brahrnin youth, rejecting tenets, falling in love

rnake Naranappa a hero. Naranappa is an antihero. But Aravasu is the hero of Agni aur Barkha
and Nittilai the heroine. All the brahrnins and
even Vishakha are anti-heroes. In Anantamurthy’s
Sarnskara Naranappa is the pollutant. Naranappa’s
corpse lying without Samskara produces plague
and destroys the entire community. In Girish’s
play brahrnins are the pollutants and Aravasu the
polluted. In the end however the out-caste Aravasu

Debuting meaninglessness

has appeared as theme in any number of tales.
Even in my own language Kannada, U.R.

Anantamurthy handles this theme admirably in a

Shall we say times have changed in Indian
literature? I think so. Tulasidasa’s proclamation,
”Let life be sacrificed and not the given word”
has an aesthetic connotation as well. There is this
silly debate that goes on endlessly, as to which is
supreme? The form? The content? Our grand
old man of Indian literature Shri Tulasidasa, seems
willing to sacrifice the content for the given form.
He says, ‘let meaning be sacrificed for the given
word’. However we do know that aesthetic debate
is always contexual and not supra-textual. The
content of every form is artistic and not realistic.
Thereby an a-political context such as ours, demands
the sacrifice of day-to—day meaning, inside art. Agni
aur Barkha is an elusive context and hence a post
modern context.
