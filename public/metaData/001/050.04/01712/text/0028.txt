He organised a number of
seminars and workshops on
theatre and culture. Finally he

developed the idea of a nationwide
democratic cultural movement
and envisaged the organisation of
a 'Ianotsav' to generate forms

appropriate to the experiences

and struggles of the Indian people.
In recognition of his contribution
to the street theatre movement
and to the growth of a democratic
culture, the Calcutta University

has recently conferred on him the

degree of D.Litt. posthumously.
He was brutally murdered in
broad day light on lst January 1989
by political gundas while he was

presenting his play HALLA BOL, a
IANAM production. He

succumbed to his injuries and
died the next evening.
