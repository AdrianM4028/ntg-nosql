The Mountain of Tyranny
Sky-high rises the Mountain of
Tyranny
Under its suffocating shadow
I cannot live I cannot breathe

On the other side ﬂows the river of

milk and honey
On this side the desolate winds
sting
This side is a barren desert

There are thorns here at every

There are no trees no ﬂowers

footstep
There are roses beyond I cannot

see
Under this mountain there is pain
and misery
On the other side lies the valley of

joy
There is desolation at home
There is desolation at heart

Sky-high rises the Mountain of
Tyranny
Under its suffocaing shadow
I cannot live I cannot breathe

Now cry long live the Revolution
With all your might grapple the

hand of oppression
Maybe together we can crush this

oppressive Mountain
Sky-high rises the Mountain of
Tyranny

Under its suffocating shadow
I cannot live I cannot breathe

Sky-high rises the Mountain of
Tyrany

Under its suffocating shadow
I cannot live I cannot breathe
