Our Flag is Red

The Boat is Ready and Bound

Red is our ﬂag comrade
Our ﬂag is red!

There is a storm in the river
And the waves are wild

We have to cross the river
Though the waves are wild
Though the waves are wild friend

When the tyrant becomes too
oppressive
And there's no way out
What shall be our slogan
Our slogan shall be strike ,

The boat is ready and bound
They sky is overcast

Red is our flag comrade
Our flag is red!

.

Of the workers and peasantry this
flag
Of all oppressed humanity this
flag
Of all lovers of liberty this flag
Into its making have gone
Centuries of sorrow
Red is our flag comrade
Our ﬂag is red!

How high is this flag flying

The sun has suddenly disappeared
There is darkness all round
Can you see the deep darkness?
In the black sea of darkness
Our world is now drowned

The waves are standing boldly
Like an impenetrable wall
But friend the boat is ready and
bound

Though the waves are wild friend
The boat is ready and bound
Hungry crocodiles wait anxiously
in the river

Love to all friends proclaiming
War to all enemies declaring

The wind cuts like a knife
And the sails are torn to shreds

The blood of the workers' heart

The oars too are in pieces
But courage alone courage alone

carrying

remains

Red is the bloodied flag of
revolution

Though the waves are wild friend

Red is our flag comrade

The boat is ready and bound.

Our flag is red!

Our flag shining like a star
Raging like a storm
Fluttering like a flame
A red ﬂame of revolution
Red is our flag comrade
Our ﬂag is red!
