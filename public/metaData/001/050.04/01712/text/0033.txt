SONGS OF THE PLAY

2
Get to Know Your Enemy
Get to know your enemy comrade
Get to know your enemy!

Which Road Shall I Take?

There are two roads in front of me

What shall I do? I am in despair!
Which road shall I take?

Those that take pity on you
Those are your enemies

Those that turn away from you
Those are your enemies
Those who sense your joys and

sorrow
Those alone are friends
Get to know your enemy comrade
Get to know your enemy!

My friends have all disappeared
Into allencompassing darkness
The dust has equalised the roads
Into all-encompassing darkness
There is stillness all round

There is no one to guide
There are two roads in front of me

What shall I do? 1 am in despair!
Which road shall I take?

They too masquerade as friends
Those who are enemies
They too use pleasantries
Those who are enemies
Those who think the enemy's a fool
They themselves are fools
Get to know your enemy comrade
Get to know your enemy!

Is there someone lurks behind you

The poor are huddled
Miserably on one road

On the other the weapons
Of the rich are raised
There are two sides to every issue

Every question has two aspects
There are two roads in front of me
What shall 1 do? I am in despair
Which road shall 1 take?

Take care, beware

Lest he rob you in broad daylight
Take care, beware

Train your mind in order
To have a clear idea of your enemy
Get to know your enemy comrade
Get to know your enemy!

The oppressors' road
Has wealth and riches
The road of confrontaion
Has misery and death
Shall 1 gamble away all comforts
Or play second fiddle?
There are two roads in front of me!
What shall I do? I am in despair
Which road shall 1 take?
