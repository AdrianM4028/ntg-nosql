( The Greased Cartridge )

This is a historical play, dedicated to the heroism of the common people
of Delhi during the war of independence of 1857.
The play opens in Gaziuddin where British mercantile greed ruins a
family of weavers, and father and infant-son are separated.

After a brief interlude in mime showing the gradual occupation of northern
India by an Indian army commmanded by British ofﬁcers, the play moves to
Meerut, May 1857, and the soldiers mutiny, and march to Delhi. Father and

son of the prologue are both in the revolutionary army, but they do not
recognize each other.
The play moves to Delhi, where the poet and patriot Bahadur Shah Zafar
is bullied by the British Agent-general Frazer, while the courtiers intrigue

against one another. The Meerut regiments arrive, execute Frazer on the
spot and proclaim Bahadur Shah Emperor of India.
Mirza Moghul, Commander of the national army, brave, patriotic, and
yet jealous of Heera Singh and Bakht Khan, the “loafers who dare to order

aristocrats about”, does not hesitate to frame Heera Singh on a treason-charge.
