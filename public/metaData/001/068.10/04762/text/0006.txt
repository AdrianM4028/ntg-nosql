People’s Little Theatre, Calcutta
presents

Tl N E R TA LWA R
The play is dedicated to the actors and actresses, who, a hundred years
ago built with their bones and blood the public theatre in Calcutta. It was a
strange time in a strange city where all art was patronized, and therefore controlled by the nouveaux, riches, whose colossal wealth was matched only by their
colosssal ignorance.

picks up a woman called Moyna from the street and trains her as an actress,
and she is an instant hit. This pleases the patron of the troupe, Birkrishna
Daw, in more ways than one; he wants to keep her as his mistress, and Beni
agrees energetically in order to build his own theatre.

Meanwhile a brutally frank and angry young man, Priyana‘th by name,
has written a patriotic play about 'I‘itu Meet, the great leader of a peasant
revolt against British imperialism. Priyanath has been secretly in love with
Moyna, and Beni’s unscrupulous deal with Birkrishna shocks him; but when he
