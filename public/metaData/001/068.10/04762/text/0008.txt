Based on Ian Petersen s‘ celebrated (Jerman Journal Unsere Strasse, ’the
play tries to capture the tensions and terrors of the Nazi rise to power in 1933,
the story-line following the infamous Zauritz murder-case.

Joseph Zauritz, 70 years of age, patroit and benefactor of the poor, is
foully murdered before his house by a group of young men yelling “Red Front”
and “Long live the Communist Party”; Frau Zauritz watches the crime from
the door. Promptly the police arrests Richard Huttig, Secretary of the
Charlottenburg District Communist Party. As the trial opens before Judge
Voss, the police piles up a formidable mass of evidence, including a bloodstained dagger and a jacket both admittedly Huttig’s, a Communist leaﬂet
sentencing Zauritz to death, and two eye-witnesses, Dr. Strubbel and Frau
Zauritz, who identify Huttig. Meanwhile Heinrich Landt, editior of the Frie
Zeitung assigns his best reporter Otto Birkholz to cover the trial, and Otto,

being of an inquiring disposition, begins to probe deeper and deeper, and even
visits Communist dens in Charlottenburg in pursuit of an illusion called Truth.
He ﬁnally comes up with little bits of information which suddenly scuttle the
entire police-case.

This sends the Nazi leader Lippert into one of his frequent ﬁts, and, while
Hitler screams about the Reichstag Fire, Lippert and Police-Chief Hess unmask

themselves and give a demonstration of naked, unashamed terror by shooting
Paul Schall, Communist, adopted son of the Zauritzes, while Frau Zauritz
watches in horror.
Frau Zauritz, Otto and Dr. Strubbel ﬁnally make up their minds about

what Hitler is doing to their country and how to ﬁght him.
