Yes, you buy your eggs
in numbers, not in measures.
But you don't depend on

eggs alone for your
daily needs. You
buy your daily milk
in litres: your favourite meat
and vegetables, fruits,
cereals and other
solid commodities
in kilogrammes;
your fanciful
dress material
in metres . . . .

Metric weights and
measures make your
buying and selling
chore easy and simple.You
need not scratch your
head or drown yourself

in tiresome calculations.
Even in the face of
rising prices, they
ensure your rupee’s
worth on all your
buys. Metric weights
and measures build

up conﬁdence
