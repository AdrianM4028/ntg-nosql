Unlike other computer centres, IDP's costing of
computer time will be on CPU time and ”0 media
ueage. This makes your data processing economical
as CPU time in normal commercial processing jobs
is at the most 10% of clock time. The extraordinary
reliability of l’DP-l 1/70 and computing power
coupled with l/O spooling further reduces the costs.
Not only is the job done economically. the waiting
time for availing computer facilities gets reduced
because the resources which would have been idle,
are being used by other USERS simultaneously.
