LOOKING B A C K :
It was in the year 1976 that
RANGAROOPA came to light when
a handful of Fresh enthusiastic
blood coalesced with some
rigorously tested veterans of
culture. Looking back to the
terrain of the decade one may not
be happy with our numerological
chronology of stage shows but it is
definitely a testimony of ceaseless
endeavour and unscrupulous
sincerity culminating to outstanding
productions like Tagore’s ”Kshudita
Pashan” and ”Cora”, Kshirode
Prosad’s ”Alibaba” and ultimately

to the threshhold of a new era—
ClNETHEATRESCOPE ”Adalate
Rabindranath”— all acclaiming
cordial reception from every corner
and truly from notable Dignitaries.
Not Cinema Scope, Theatrescope or

Shankar Scope but ClNETHEATRE—
SCOPE named after the
BIOTHEATRE of the West in an
experimental and challenging
venture symbolising Tagore genius
to eternal truth, beauty and
aesthetics in a trio of idealism,
romanticism and materialism.
Indeed we are not merely a cultural
organisation but an institution with

the manifesto of being trained
extensively to build ourselves up
as challenging soldiers in the field
of culture.
Rangaroopa has started a regular
workshop for imparting training in
acting for Stage, Television, Radio

& Cinema under the guidance of
Mr. Subrata Mukherjee, Drama
Producer for Calcutta Doordarshan.

. . . Not that ”Rangaroopa” was
determined ab initio to the flaunt
dramatic novelty but it remained
steadfast in its theory and practice
that the drama like the ones they

have given can be subjected to
different angles of scrutiny and
a naly SIS.
