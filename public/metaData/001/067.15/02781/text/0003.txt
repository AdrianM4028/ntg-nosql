FROM TH E CONV‘EN ER

The roots of Indian Theatre tradition lie in the
ancient treatise, the Natya Shastra, which is a compilation
concerning the performing arts. It has a unique heritage of
innumerable
traditional
art
forms,
whose
codification has
ensured continuity over three thousand years.
The influence
of the West during British rule had a strong grip over the
style of presentation.
With the Freedom Movement this grip
was loosened.
Many Plays were written against political
oppression
and
foreign
dominance,
showing
the
Indian
aspiration for freedom.
With independence Indian theatre was
liberated from ‘the' shackles of ‘western lnodels -and rnindless
borrowings.
Indian - Theatre
embarked
on
a
journey
rediscovering its glorious classical traditions, which have
sustained themselves through the centuries in folk form.
This
Festival
of
Plays
to
mark
the
50th
anniversary of India's independence has been dedicated to the
memory of one of the pioneers of Modern Indian Theatre Shri
Sombhu Mitra.
We

convey

our

grateful

thanks

to

all

those

institutions and individuals whose support has made this event
a reality.
