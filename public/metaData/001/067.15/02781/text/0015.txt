Play : Chittaranjan Ghose

Direction : Kumar Roy

‘Lovely is a precious gem' - these words are from a lyric written by Ramnidhi Gupta,
one of the most well-known musicians of the late 18th and early 19th century Bengal.
Nidhubabu, as. he is popularly known is the pioneer of light classical music in Bengal,

and this romantic Play centres around him. It deals with the romance of music, the agonies
and ecstasies of an artistic soul. His personal strife. His choice of music over money. All in
a historical setting of the East India Company days.
There is a love triangle with its ensuing entanglements. lts heartburn, its doubts and its
passions. It all comes together in death - which surmounts all conflicts and confirms only
that which is eternal and beautiful. ln music as in love.

This socio-political play encapsules a period of 50 years in a day and a night.

The scene is set in Bihar. The object of concern is an unidentified dead body. Neither
a tax official, nor a judge, nor the police show the responsibility or capability of handling the
case. The State machinery is a dead loss.
