SOMBHU MITRA - A doyen of Theatre

More than a decade ago, a Maestro in the theatre arts bade
adieu to the make-believe world of the stage. In May last,

he bid adieu to the world.

'

Throughout his career, he strove to propagate the virtues of

good theatre. In fact, his withdrawal from active stage perform-

ance signalled the end of an era to modern theatre that began
with Girish Ghose, followed by Ahindra Choudhury and Sisir

Bhaduri. Even though he bowed out of arc lights in 1985 after
a scintillating performance in Dasachakra, there was already a
halo around him that never allowed him to fade out. For, he is

often credited with evolving the Bengali stage into a realistic medium from the highly stylised

genre it once was.

With some like-minded senior and junior comrades, he formed Bohurupee in 4948. It provided him the steady platform from where he set more than one milestone on the track of
modern Bengali theatre. If Nabanna marked the beginning of the truly ‘modern’ theatre in
Bengal, the production of Raktakaravi, which even Tagore did not risk to get performed, and
to make it a raving success, was second in the series.

Honours came in abundance in recognition of his achievements : Grand Prix at Carlovy
vary Film Festival for Jagte Raho; Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and Fellowship;
Padmabhushan, Magsaysay Award, Kalidas Samman and many others.

With a sonorous and resCJnant voice that could glide from bass to tenor, a keen under-

standing of the poetry of the theatie which was at once rooted to tradition and contemporary, emotional and intellectual standards of his performing excellence would remain a cherished ideal for generations to come.
