10.00 am. daily. The lec—dem series featuring demonstrations by
masters with their disciples and lectures by the eminent scholars
gives an opportunity to the students and rasikas of theatre arts in
Delhi to understand the fundamentals of Kutiyattam, its technique,
conventions and asthetics.
An important dimension of the festival is documentation of
Kutiyattam. All through the festival interviews, discussions,
demonstrations and performances would be recorded on audio,
video and ﬁlm for the archives of the Akademi. This would yield
rich source material for future research on Kutiyattam and Nangiar
Kuttu .
On this occasion Akademi is bringing out a special issue of its
quarterly journal SANGEET NATAK devoted to Kutiyattam edited
.
by Prof. K. Ayyappa Paniker.
A festival of this nature can be successfully organised only with
the support of various institutions and individuals committed to the
preservation and promotion of traditional arts. We are thankful to
the participating institutions as also to the eminent experts and
others who helped plan and present this event. We are particularly
grateful to Pandit KP. Narayana Pisharody of Trichur for his
valuable advice and gracious presence in Delhi to inaugurate the
festival.
On the occasion of Kutiyattam Mahotsavam, Sangeet Natak
Akademi gratefully recalls the contribution of Late D. Appukuttan
Nair to the art of Kutiyattam. His ideas, concepts and his creative
guidance to Akademi’s Project of Support to Kutiyattam serve as the
backdrop to this festival.
