Sita : Yes, it is his voice.

[Srirama and Sita exit]

[Enter Surpanakha and Lakshmana. They
together enact the entry]
Lakshmana : Stop, demoness, stop!

[When Surpanakha is about to grab Lakshmana
the latter rushes back to the nepathya, followed by
Surpanakh a]

him. [Surpanakha goes up into the sky carrying
Lakshman a. ]
[Enter Srirama and Sita]

Srirama : Devi, give up your fear; gather courage and
leave me. The demoness is carrying Lakshmana
into the sky.
Sita ८ Who is there to protect me, lord?

Srirama : Who will protect Lakshmana?

[Enter Srirama and Sita]

Sita : Hasn‘t he got a weapon in his hands?

Srirama : [listening and seeing] What is this,
Lakshmana? Ferocious canine teeth. copper—
coloured hair, a mountainous figure. cloud colour.
It causes fear in me, who has killed 'Iataka.

Srirama : For one who is in the grip of the demoness,
what use is his weapon? [Sits down upset] Even as
I look on. the demoness has taken hold of
Lakshmana and disappeared into the sky. [He
enacts getting ready for a fight. strings his bow.
picks up from the quiver an arrow] What holy
weapon has to be used against her !
Offstage : [from the nepalhya] Oh! I have been
thrown to the ground. Help me. O! Lord. help me !

Sita : My lord. stop the demoness. stop her.
Srirama : Devi, no need to fear. Haven‘t you seen
before the figure of the demoness on the wall?
[Srirama and Sita exit]

[Surpanakha enters]

Surpanakha : I, who am fed up with eating the flesh
of hermits, have just got soft and sweet food.

Having eaten up these ones. I shall make a gift of
her to Ravan. [Leaves]

Srirama : [after enacting listening to the offstage
voice] This is a female voice I hear. What is the
reason for this earthquake? Lakshmana has
brought the demoness to the ground ?
Sita : I too guess the same.

[ Enters L akshm ana ]

Lakshmana : Here is she rushing towards me. She
waves her hands long enough to touch the clouds
and turn around so as to make the earth‘s surface
undulating.
She is rushing towards us with her mouth like the
gate of an open fort.
[Enter Srirama and Sita]

Srirama : Here. she leaps into the sky. Again she is
on the earth making twists and turns running and
jumping about and straightening herself. With the
tips of her nails sharp like swords she tears the
clouds to pieces.
Sita : My lord, stop the demoness. stop her.
Srirama : Devi. don’t be afraid. don‘t be afraid, 0!
fair one, this is only a machine whose inside is
hollow. Not a demoness. If my weapon touches
her, she will at once fall to the ground and start
w alkin g .

Lakshmana : Brother. be pleased, I shall stop her
myself. [He intervenes]
Surpanakha : Alas. alas! These humans which are my
food are attacking me!
Lakshmana : I will slice you up into bits for birds to
eat.
Surpanakha : Let me first devour this cruel-hearted
one.
Srirama : Stop. stop! We are not hermits to forgive
your atrocities. Give up your present attempt. You
demoness. our arrows are least merciful to
de m0 n s .
[ Surpan akh a grabs Lakshm ana ]
Lakshmana : Here. because of a small blunder, I have

fallen into her grip.
Surpanakha: Mountain peaks are lighter compared to

Srirama : Devi, hold on to my hand and come with
me. Let me look for Lakshmana.

Sita : I’ll try. Both walk about in a stylized manner.
[Chellunti natakkuka]
Srirama : What is this ? Is it water rushing oozing the
mineral reserves of the mountains, flowing from
the rivers into the forest? Is it the clouds of the
deluge making an offering of blood red as the
rising sun?

[Then enters Lakshmana. He enters standing on
the pilha. He is coming down from the sky to the
earth]

Lakshrnana 2 Alas ! I violate myself by using a
weapon for the first time against a woman. Or
perhaps, there is nothing to regret in this. Seeing
the enmity of the demoness and my brother’s
determination, I cut off her nose and ears with
great difficulty. Let me now go to my brother.

[Lakshmana withdraws into the nepathya. When
Srirama and Sita enter the stage. Lakshmana goes to
them]

Lakshmana : May you prosper. my Lord.
Srirama : [embracing him with pleasure] 0. my

mind! be comforted. Lakshmana is all right.
Because of him, I remain as happy in the forest as
in Ayodhya. Brother. where is that demoness ?
Lakshmana: What am I to say! [Stands with head
bowed down]

[Then enters Surpanakha wailing aloud — The
scene of ‘Ninam‘l

Surpanakha : 0 my lord Ravana! My lord
Kumbhakarna! My lord Vibhishana! Save me, 0,

save me from the violence of humans dressed up
as hermits!
Srirama : Behold Lakshmana: Like a row of scarlet
