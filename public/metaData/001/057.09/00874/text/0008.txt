SANGEE'I‘ NATAK AKADEMI
PROJECT OF‘ SUPPORT TO
K UPI YA'I‘TA M

Akademi Project of Support to
Kutiyattam was launched in MarchApril 1991 with the following
objectives:
— To ensure and support a systematic
process of transmission of the art
from ageing gurus to the younger
generation through an
institutionalised set-up,
incorporating the best elements of
personalised training on the lines of
traditional gurukularn;
— To sponsor regular year-round
performances of Kutiyattam in
order to provide economic
sustenance to the artistes and to
create a better understanding of and
appreciative audience for the art.

With the above objectives in View,
the following programme is being
implemented under the project:
1. Developing Arnmannur
Gurukulam as a pivotal centre for
training in Kutiyattam
Considering that Ammannur
Madhava Chakyar is the sole
surviving master of the older
generation, whose services for the
sustenance and revival of the
tradition are of particular
importance, it was decided to
provide substantial funding for a
training programme under him.
Monthly honorarium for the
teachers and musicians, fellowships
and scholarships for students and
subsidy for students’ performances
are being provided.
2. Developing Margi, ’I‘rivandrum as
a centre for providing regular
performance opportunities to
trained artistes
With a view to developing a centre
for regular performances of
Kutiyattam providing, inter alia, a
source of employment] income to

the practitioners of the art, Margi,
Trivandrum, is being supported.
Four performances every month are
being sponsored here to be
presented not only by the artistes of
Margi, but also including individual
artistes from other centres. This
programme is directed to providing
an ideal setup for Kutiyattam
performances in the contemporary
context and thereby building, in the
long run, a reliable audience base
for the art.
3. Training in Mizhavu
Apart from the above two major
segments of the project, a special
training programme in Mizhavu
playing is also being conducted
under Guru P.K. Narayanan
Nambiar at Lakkidi providing
honorarium to the guru and
scholarships to students.

Keeping in view the success
achieved so far, it has been decided to
expand the scope of the project by
including the following programmes
from April 1995 :

1. Support to Kutiyattam artistes of
Kerala Kalarnandalam by
sponsoring year-round
performances in different parts of
the state;

2. Reprinting of books on Kutiyattam;

3. Survey, collection, transcription and
copying of palmleaf manuscripts for
