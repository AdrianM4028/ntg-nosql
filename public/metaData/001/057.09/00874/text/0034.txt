Now Jatayu (the divine bird and friend of Rama)

exclaims from the nepalhya, “I am coming." Suta looks
around, fixes his eyes on the back left corner of the
stage and enacts the approach of a huge bird (vulture).
He reports to (his master) Ravana, “Oh my lord! See.
see l" Recites sloka and enacts its meaning. “0h lord, a
bird approaches to interrupt our forward movement.
How does he look? His beak is like a hook. His neck is
like a golden stem. His eyes are as read as cut rubies.
The huge air currents caused by the movemean of his
wings, cause the trees to swing wildly and shed their
flowers and even flower buds, which fall to the ground.
See such a terrible bird."
S ita, crying, says. “Who is there to save me. Whom
should I approach for refuge."
The curtain is held on the raised portion of the
stage, Jatayu enters (a lighted lamp and rain of flowers
accompany his entry). He makes ritualistic movements
inside the curtain.
The curtain is removed.
‘Pravesikam' and ‘Pakshistobham‘ (entry and the
characteristic bird stances) are enacted to the

accompaniment of special rhythm pattern — termed as

‘ Lakshmi Ihala’ .
Jatayu acts as being seated atop the ‘Prasravana'
mountain and gestures, “What do I hear? Is it? ‘Who is
to save me? Who is to save me? Who is my refuge?‘ It
is Sita crying?"
Recites and enacts, “Sita, I am here to save you.
Don‘ t worry and cry. I am a close friend and comrade
of the great King Dasaratha of the solar race. I am
Jatayu. It is just to save you that I am here. I am
coming ."
Turning to Ravana, “()h Ravana stop your chariots.
You let free Sita, beloved of Rama, the great hero. You
set her free and go away. If people make mistakes
unknowingly. I correct them and forgive them. So if
you want to be alive, set her free and be gone ! "
Ravana stands pensive for a while and asks, “This
bird says, he won‘ t mind my mistakes !" With a
contemptuous gesture, orders the charioteer. “You whip
him away and clear the way for us to proceed. He does
not know how invincible I am."
Jatayu, “I know. I know everything about you.

the pieces of flesh in all the ten directions. Ho do you
look? You are as dark as the clouds at the time of
Pralaya (deluge) and as big as the mountain in your
stature. Your heads appear as if they are the peaks of
Anjana mountain with wild fire burning brightly over
them in the dark night; with ruddy hair waving in the
wind. Again, when I peck at your neck with furious
thrusts, the veins will open up and the blood torrenting
out will add its red hue to the entire environment."
Enacts pecking at him fiercely and cries out, “See.”
After slolaz, proceeds to stop Ravana. Ravana stops
him and they are engaged in lighting pecking with
beak, wounding with claws, beating with wings etc. As
the fight goes on Ravana thinks, “This bird cannot be
defeated by straight fighting. He mUst be cheated and
killed. What can I do ?" Enacts, “Yes, there is a trick to

play." He enquires of Jatayu, “Where is your most
vulnerable part (marma). The gullible Jatayu replies
with candour, “It is in my right wing. Now could you
tell me the vulnerable part of your body?"
Ravana dishonestly answers, “It is my big toe in my
right leg." The fight continues. Jatayu tries to peck at
the big toe of Ravana‘s right leg. Using this chance,
Ravana cuts off the right wing of Jatayu, holding the
wing with his left hand. Jatayu falls wounded. He tries
to ﬂy with his left wing; but in vain and breathes
heavily.
As Jatayu falls, Sita cries. She screens her eyes with
her hands; not being able to stand the pitiable sight.
Suta enacts — “This bird has been cut with the
mighty divine sword. This vulture is cut." Recites .rloka
and enacts its meaning thus : “Here the bird, with its
body covered with drops of blood and muddy in
appearance, with its neck turned around due to
exhaustion, lies. It appears like an evening cloud in the
sky." Sita, weeping, recites and enacts, “Alas, God is
unkind. Unfortunate that I am, the bird came to save
me, taking pity on me. By another misfortune it was
also killed. The bird too had to fall a prey to the
wickedness of Ravana."
Ravana orders, “Suta (charioteer), drive the horses.

Suta, “As ordered, my Lord
Suta continues, “How is this master of mine?"
Recites sloka and enacts its meaning thUs: “To the
dictates of Dharma (righteous conduct), worldly
wisdom, means of salvation to the other world, tenets
of the Dharma shastras (ethics) , action according to the

need of the times etc., which are to be scrupulously
adhered to, he does not listen. What is the state of
Karnadeva ? Those, under the influence of amorous
passions, do not listen to the relative merits of good and
evil conducts. Beacuse of this there is (absolutely) no

use in advising him about them."
Acting thus and after recitation of the .rloka, the
three characters enact the stylised movements symbolic
of moving about in a chariot.
[The performance ends with a ritual termed ‘ Mudi
Akkitta' which is enacted at the end of a full act in
Ku tiy attam ] .
