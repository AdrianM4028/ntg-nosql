characterisations.

My

dramatic

emphasis is on the hero-who
may help in arising the religious feelings among the audience.
In its story I have symbolised the triumph of virtue over vice.
For dramatic impact the most powerful theatre form of Swang(NAUTANKi style) is portrayed. The accent in this form is understandably on amorous and heroic feats.

However, my interpretation of the three plays is serious by
nature. Most of the tunes are adapted from the six-blendful
tunes from the popular folk-songs of the land. I have visualised
a unique setting different from the regular stage settings. The
total atmosphere is based on; mimicry, jugglery and warriors's fight.
