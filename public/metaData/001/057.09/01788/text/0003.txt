The approach would be stylised one but what is known by
the term stylisation today has become so vague and commonly.
Though I can not give it any new name of my theatrical style, it
is to be called stylisation. This whole process of a mode. n theatre
discovering its own traditional presentation is that artistic thrust
which prompts me to take up such projects.
