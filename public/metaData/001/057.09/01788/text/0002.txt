Jungle Tantrarn is the story of Iion, snake, pea-cock and the

rat.

All of them are in the service of Shiva, Parvati and Ganesh.

Once they start quarreiing with each other and are cursed by Shiva
to go on earth.

When they reach earth, the lion declares himself the king,
appoints pea-cock as his administrator, snake as the representative
of the merchant class and the rat is left to suffer as a common
[T] a n .

From here onwards the story revolves round the struggles
of each individual to win over the rat to his side so that he may
capture the power. Thus it becomes a biting satire on the present
democratic system in any country.
The entire novel is written as a fantasy but with an absolute contemporary relevance.
