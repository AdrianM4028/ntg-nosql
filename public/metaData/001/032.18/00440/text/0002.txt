"THE socrsrv r""""‘

'

Art and industry are generally rigidly compartmentalised ignoring

the fact that those who work in the industries have fundar‘nentally
the some human concerns as anyone outside may have. Similarly
art, can not thrive as an exclusive sphere oi activity: interaction with
productive forces will only enrich it. The Bharat E isotron ics Cultural
Society aims at accelerating such interaction. The presentation of
Vansh Nagar Ka Vyepari, in which most of the actors are amateurs,

is a modest attempt in this direction.
