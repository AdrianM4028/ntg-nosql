DIRECTOR’S NOTE
THE SCREAM .......................
THEN SILENCE ...................
To feel. talk, communicate beyond all boundaries
is now a primal urge .......
To explore the space that exists between our screams
and silences and realise, relate to that inter— connected flow.........
The warm & cool, not too rigid .....You’re in between.
You’re free; your vital energy flows, creativity blooms.
You create your beauty, nurture and share it.
You’re both man and woman rmw.Your soul is joyous
and celebrating.
You feel it all, in & out......
Hecuba, the mother, lives in every man.
.
Our play is about hope, the child.
Classical Greek Mythology tells us about Pandora, the first woman on Earth
who opened her box of dowry from Zeus and unleashed upon mankind all
miseries, amongst which resided the only happy feeling - HOPE : woman’s gift
to humankind.
Tomorrow is real.We have a possible future.
To outlive this onslaught that destroys all “hope”;
hope for life to regenerate, to heal, to be born again:
a mighty weapon that destroys everything forever,
we need to come together.
It is HERE.......

where seedlings grow,
our songs blend in harmony,
you feel the other heart,
and your ﬂower blooms.
