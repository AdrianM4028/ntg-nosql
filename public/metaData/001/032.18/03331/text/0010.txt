power can satiate their egos?
It is not that we should avoid war always and adopt the OStrich-like attitude.

but it should always be the last resort. Sometimes was is inevitable. but
most wars in the past could have been easily avoided, had their champions

acted with prudence and reStraint.
In the times of nuclear and hydrogen bombs, the proportions are going to
be monumental, the statistics and logistics are going to be much more
sensational for the military types, and we are going to face new diseases and
deformities laden with nuclear radiation. One major nuclear war is
appropriate to finish the entire planet 0 a planet that has evolved in millions
of years can be finished off in one afternoon. Man has certainly gone places!

Prosperity follows peace, goes the old adage. Whenever there has been
peace for a considerable duration, there has been a manifold advance in
technology, literature, philosophy and thought, arts, education, health and
other fields that stimulate progress. And it is not a farfetched ideology u
there are millions who cherish a dream of eternal peace, and era devoid of
war and weapon, a time when we would literally forget what war is.
