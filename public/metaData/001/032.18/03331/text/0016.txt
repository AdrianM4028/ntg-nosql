The world looks blue and green
OHCl the SHOW clad {WOUHIOMR WlllTE’

From a distance
the ocean meets the stream

God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us
From a distance

and the eagle takes to flighi
From a distance

From a distance
there is harmony
and it echoes through the land
It’s the voice of hope
It’s the voice of peace

you look like my friend
even though we are at wai
From a distance
I just cannot comprehend
why all this ﬁght is fought

It’s the voice of every man
From a distance
From a distance

there is harmony

we all have enough

and it echoes through the land
It's the hope of hope

and no one is in need
There are no guns,
no bombs and no disease

lt's the peace of peace
It’s the mice of every man

No hungry mouths to feed
From a distance
we are instruments
marching in a common land

God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us
From a distance

Playing songs of hope
Playing songs of peace
They’re the songs of every man

- Bette Midler
