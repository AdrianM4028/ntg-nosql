Designer’s Perspective
Kahi Nath Raha

A drama or any other type of performance can only be successful when
all faculties are synchronized. Our artists today are children with whom
synchronization is a problem especially of the five basic senses.
When I was asked to design the sets and costumes, it came to me
as a challenge as it was different from any other play that I had designed
for. After going through the story line of the play, I spent some time
with the children to understand in what respect they were different
from other ’normal’ children. My interactions with them made me feel
that since it would be difficult for us to use our usual methods of drama
it would be more appropriate to use the play way method instead. The
’mela’ sequence was thus introduced.
To create the ambience of a mela, a high platform was constructed
for the children to use as the main selling point. The idea was that the
children would come to the mela, pick up the headgears, wear them
and gradually get involved in the drama. Generally, when an animal
character is prepared, the body is the animal body and the face is covered
with a mask. But, we did not want the characters to look like animals

and we were apprehensive of their reaction if we covered their faces.
Hence, it was decided that they would wear ordinary clothes with
animallike headgear that would keep their faces uncovered. This would
enable them to identify one another and enjoy the transformation. Efforts
were made to make the headgear light and comfortable and were given
to the children to practise with well before the final day.

While designing the set, I kept in mind the different styles of
walking and sitting in the children. I left a lot of free space on the stage
for free movement. At first I designed the entire concept on paper by
making scaled models of the stage and sets to form the basic
consolidation of thoughts and ideas with the Director and the Script
writer and other colleague friends.
