Raghudev Memorial School of Special Education
The teacher training course in Special Education in Mental Handicap
was started on the 3rd of March, 1999 with the aim of providing quality
training for committed individuals who desire to work with children
with mental handicap.

The most valuable resource that any facility for persons with
mental handicap has, is it’s staff. With trained staff, even the most mod-

ern setup, can at best provide only the basic level services. As in any
organization, the key to better service and implementation of sugges—
tions for improvement lies in staff training. Realizing this, we started

the teacher training course at 9, Rajpur Road, Civil Lines. This location
also has the advantage of being in North Delhi, an area where no other
special education training course is available.

The training program focuses on practical work with children
followed by theory classes to provide for the framework of a holistic
understanding of mental handicap and its associated conditions. The
subjects taught cover medical aspects, techniquest of special education, psychology, speech and language development, physical development, habilitation, family and community and other alternative forms

of ttherapy like drama and yoga. Such diverse areas of knowledge are
imparted as special education programmes have to be seen in the overall perspective of the habilitation of persons with mental handicap,
keeping in View their diverse circumstances. These could range from
differing socioeconomic conditions, rural/urban location, specific cultural groups and the individual needs of the persons and their fami—
lies.
The course faculty consists of leading practitioners in the areas
being taught and are drawn from the University of Delhi and other private institutionsproviding services to persons with mental handicap.
The course offers a Diploma upon completion.
