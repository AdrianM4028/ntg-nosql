Director’s Note
Dr Ashish Ghosh

Drama is an enabling experience. It symbolizes the motivation to do, to
act out. Our whole effort has been to prove a point that the children of
Prabhat, with their varying degrees of learning difficulties can play
drama, that they can do more than what is expected of them.

Irshad conducted a month long workshop with the children.
The results were apparent in their enjoyment of the games and the
activities. Communication became easier. We also learned about their
difficulties. Improvization of the chosen theme was of limited value.
The children had to be given one instruction at a time. Saying too much
together could lead to confusion. The work needed patience, confidence
building and a gradualistic approach. The children had to be conditioned
by repeated exercises in sequence and with definite signals.
The play was thus structured on a series of clues - either visual,
musical or with movements, sounds, sets and props. On our part it has
been a continuous search for simple devices that would enable them to
play.
However, we also had to constantly remember that they would

have to play not only amongst themselves but for the audience in the
theater. This meant that the play had to be handled with the same
(if not more) technical dexterity as in other productions. To camouflage
the techniques used, we decided to revert to one of the original purposes
of theater, that of celebration and festivity. Festivity is togetherness.

These children more that anybody else need friends, want company
and enjoy togetherness. That is why we started the play with the ’mela’
sequence and ended it with a scene of gay abandon linking the main
story with these two scenes.
We have tried to make them play out their roles without direct help on
stage, providing however, full support off stage. I think that is what they need,
what we all need — a good support system to make things happen!
