The main set was a platform with steps on either side. This structure
was designed to serve multiple purposes. As a high platform in the
rnela scene, as a chaupal in the jungle scene and as a cave for the lion a
later scene. Thus, one prOp was variously used to depict different
situations to reduce the risk of confusing the children with frequent
changes and also to keep costs at a minimum.
When the rehearsals started in the school premises, two important
aspects were taken care of. At first the exact dimensions of the stage
were painted out on the floor of the terrace where the rehearsals were
to be. Secondly, the children were introduced to the multifunctional
main platform and the miniature model of the stage. Free access to this
prop was allowed and the sense of achievement felt by the children as
they ran up and down the stairs was palpable and exciting to watch. I t
helped in the integration and identification of the children with the
characters and the story line.

for the woods would be silent
