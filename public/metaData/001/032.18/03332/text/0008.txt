Structure as I understood it was form that was unchangeable. I had
believed that structure was based on rules. Perhaps I too was not wrong.
My reorientation was that instead of moving from improvisations to
the final form, I would have to define a framework that would form the

basic building blocks or the loose links which once established would
’
help the process of improvisation.
Gradually I also learned that the younger children behaved
differently from the older ones. The younger set were as naughty as
३ naughty can be. The older ones were capable but shy and withdrawn. I
thought that their mind set started from the ’cannot do’. My immediate
task was to make them ’do’, whatever they could, and as they went

along I encouraged them with praise and appreciation.
The games I concentrated upon were related to enhancing and
exploring relationships, expressions and communications, emotions and
reﬂexes. The games also focussed on movements, space, rhythm and

concentration.

The one month workshop helped children remarkably. For
example, Harpreet would run away whenever I called the group for
the games and now he refuses to leave the group even if his mother
comes early to take him home. Anchal would get confused often but
now is eager to step forward to act and talk. All followed instructions,
all improved in their responses and all showed signs of discipline and
participation.

When the actual play was started, the child were ready and most
importantly I was confident in the knowledge that they were.
This experience made me understand how unfair the world has
been with such children. People tend to either push them to achieve
beyond their capabilities or pamper them thinking that they cannot
achieve. Both stances are hindrance in their development. As with
’normal’ children a balance has to be created between capabilities,
progress and encouragement.
