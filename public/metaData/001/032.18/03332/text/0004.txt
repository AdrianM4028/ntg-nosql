Hul Hai Simpal
Adapted from a famous story- frorn the Panchatantra, Hul Hai Simpal celebrates
the victory of collective action. Brieﬂy, the story revolves around a lion who realizing

his powers, terrorizes the animals of thejungle to send him an animal everyday, failing
which he would choose the animals to eat at will.
This edict frightened the animals so much that they decide to comply with his
wishes by selecting an animal by lottery each day. The sadness of each family as a
member is sacriﬁced to the ravenous appetite of the lion compels the wily rabbit to
think of a plan. Following the story form the Panchatantra the play depicts the clever
manner in which the rabbit fools the lion to chase hi5, competitor, to his own eventual
death. The play ends with much rejoicing and merriment.
This is the basic story line.
There are a few points that require some elaboration to bring attention to
some of the nuances of the scenes and the manner they were dealt with. The effort of
staging the play has been an integrated one, with support provided by professionals
from the theater world and children from Mother’s International, Mirarnbika and

Springdales (Dhaula Kuan) schools. The children of the regular schools and the chil-

dren of Prabhat were required to learn the art of working collectively to produce a
play that would entertain others and themselves.
The other point of interest is the innovative start to the play — the mela scene

which helped set the mood for the evening and provided an opportunity for most of
the students of Prabhat, alongwith their teachers and parents, to actively be a part of
the play and the celebration it so innately depicts.
The play ends with yet anotherjoyous scene that of victory - the victory of
togetherness and of helping one another that we hope will herald an awakening for
_ the children of Prabhat.
