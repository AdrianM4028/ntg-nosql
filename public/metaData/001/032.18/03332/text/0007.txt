My experience with the children of Prabhat
Irshad Alam, Workshop In charge and Asst Director
On the first day when I reached Prabhat and was introduced to the
children there, I was in a state of shock - for I had never seen so many

children with mental and physical handicaps together before. I was so
dismayed that I persistently thought ’how will I play drama with
them?’
Before actually starting the workshop I made several Visits to
the school to observe the children and be observed by them. In the
process of acquainting myself with their behavior I began to understand
their pranks, their naughtiness and in so many ways their similarities
with the other children I usually work with. Over a short span I made
friends with some of them. I began to relax and saw some hope.
On the first day of the workshop I was very nervous. I was at a
loss as to what games and activities would be appropriate with them.
There was a communication gap. I could not make them understand
what I wanted of them and they could not make me understand what
they wanted to do. My planning was upset.
I sought the help of the staff at Prabhat. Ihey suggested that I
provide instructions that were definite and structured. At first I thought
it was too narrow an approach, too restrictive - for I did want to work
with them through games that would help them improvise and thereby
learn. I decided to work with them in my way. I explained games to
them and sat around waiting for their response. The result - blank stares.
I then understood the meaning of the terms definite and structured.
Ihey were terms not used111 the conventional sense. Ihe terms indicated
the underlying philosophy of the strategy of teaching. ’Definite’ meant
clear-cut- for that I had to reorient myself to be clear111 my own thinking
- what were the steps, the tiny steps that made up the sequence of the
game? I began to understand the meaning of the term ’structure’.
