MEGHDOOT
MeghDoot of Mahakavi Kalidas translated by renowned Hindi literateur. Nagarjun, is not a play like
the other ones written by him. But he reaches his
greatest poetic heights in this work. He dwells on the
mysterious relationship between the animate and the
inanimate. the Cosmic unity, as it were, that mankind has ever been aspiring to achieve. It depicts the
sufferings of a heavenly denizen, called the Yaksha,
who has been exiled by Kubera, the God ofWealth, to
a place called Ramgiri for one year, punishing him for
negligence of his duties, due to his deep intimacy with
his newly wed wife. By selecting the cloud as the
messenger of Yaksha, Kalidas has given an entirely
new dimension to his poetic imagination transcending the bounds of the living and the non living. Out of
the entire work spread over one hundred and seventeen Verses, only thirty verses have been selected for
this presentation, some from “Poorva Megha” and

some from “Uttar Megh”. The imaginary ﬂight and
journey of the cloud messenger, has been depicted
through music. light, sound and other images sym—
bolic of the rainy season. but only as supportive
elements, the main vehicle of presentation being the
music, vocal or instrumental.
