My dear Upretiji
Please refer to your letter of 28th September, 1 984.

I am glad to know that you are presenting an episode
from the Mahabharata in Hindi based on Pandav Jagar
of G a rh we I .

I

hope I shall be in a position to witness this perfor-

mance. l have always been very impressed with your
capacity for trying upon the creative talents of a wide
variety of people Er your ability to re-create the milieu of
the himalayas.

Many ballets and local versions of epics have great
meaning and relevance today.

i

am glad that you have

chosen this theme.

With kind regards and all the good wishes,
You rs sincerely,

Ka p i I a Vats y ay a n
