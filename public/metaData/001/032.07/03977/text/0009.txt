The emergence of

traditional

forms

in the area of

of
dance, music and theatre has in recent years been one

the most significant factors in the enlargement of our
understanding of Indian performing arts. India is a land
where many cultures fuse.

Creative forms of expression

result from an interplay of humankind with seasons,
legend and the tools of expression, that have evolved over
the centuries. Unique in interpretation, they become one,
through the epics and Puranas and the common understan-

ding of sound and movement.
I wish the Parvatiya Kala Kendra much joy in their
interpretation of Pandav Jagar of Garhwal.
