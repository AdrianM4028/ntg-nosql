It is a matter of great pleasure to know that the
Parvatiya Kala Kendra, Delhi has decided to present an
important episode from Mahabharata from 29th to 31 st
October 1 984. I am also glad to know that the Kendra is
going to publish a souvenir on the occasion.
The Kendra has been doing commendable work for the
preservation and popularisation of the folk art of Kumayun
and Garhwal Hills Region through its successful opera
presentations. I wish the Kendra all success in its laudable
efforts.
