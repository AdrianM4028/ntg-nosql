MESSAGE
I am glad that the Parvatiya Kala Kendra is presenting
epiSodes from the Mahabharat» based on the well known
Pandav Jagar of the Garhwal region from October 29 to
31 . The Parvatiya Kala Kendra has come of age now. It
has engaged itself in the preservation and popularisation
of distinctive forms of the folk art of Kumaon and Garhwal
hills. It is important that the rich folk art of different
parts of the country finds its due place in the magnificient
mosaic of our national culture. Folk art draws its strength
from the people and can retain its vitality only by main-

taing a living link with them. At the same time, the use
of modern techniques are necessary to extend the appeal
of folk art forms to wider audiences. The Kala Kendra, I
am glad to say, has succeeded on both counts, and it has
staged a number of successful operas and dance performances both in India and abroad. I have great pleasure in
wishing all success in their efforts.
