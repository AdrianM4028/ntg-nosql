”YOU CAN GO TO ANY PLACE AND AT
ANY TIME THAT YOU WISH TO GO”

Travel, what a marvellous way to give the soul a
break. Especially when you know you can leave
all the mundane things to somebody else.

Things like where to stay, how to get there.
Details like confirming flights and hotel
reservations. Problems like how to hire
1 00 luxury buses for the day.

Isn’t it nice to know you can just close your eyes

and concentrate on giving y0ur soul a break—
and leave the worrying to us?

Remember—just call Mercury.
