WHY MAHABHARAT ?
Like Ramlila, Mahabharat constitutes an important element not only in

the folklore of Kumaon and Garhwal, but also of the entire central Himalayan
region. In Garhwal, it has taken a dance form, popularly known as “Pandav
Jagar”. It has its several variants, both in content and form. The Parvatiya
Kala Kendra, in continuation of its pursuit of presenting the folk ballads of
Uttarakhand in operatic stage adaptations, decided to take up Mahabharat this
year. This is the ﬁfth opera, preceded by four earlier ones, viz., RajulaMalushahi, Ajua-Bafaul, Gangnaath and Ram-Lila. Mahabharat was chosen
this time for its contemporary relevance as well as an urge to experiment with
Hindi presentation of Uttarakhand ballads in order to enhance their appeal for
a wider audience.
Mahabharat has several local variants, in respect of episodes as well as
their interpretation. The Kendra has, however, stuck to the universally
accepted storyline. Nevertheless the sequences chosen have been condensed and
rehashed to suit to our requirements. The sequences help in highlighting the
futility of war and the pointless game of preparing for it. The production
would hopefully project the agony of mankind caught up in the vicious circle of
war and continuous unabated piling up of weapons of mass annihilation leading
the mankind to a point of no return.
As far as Pandav Jagar proper is concerned we have borrowed certain
motifs in music, dance and narration of the ballad and woven them together in
a wider pattern to suit the requirements of our presentation. To cope with this
we have incorporated some classical modes as well blending them, wherever
necessary, with the traditional folk modes. I ﬁnd no dissodance in this.
Since majority of the participants are new-comers to the Hindi Stage, I

would request the audience to bear with us and ignore the ﬂaws likely to occur
in transforming a traditional regional form into a national one.
