Dear Shri Upreti,

I am happy to learn that the ‘Parvatiya Kala Kendr
a’ is going to stage the
famous Uttarakhand ballad 'Jeetu Bagdwal’.
The Kendra has done pioneering
work in presenting the dances, dramas and
operas of Uttarakhand to audiences

in Delhi and elsewhere in a form which lends itself
to modern stage-craft.
I wish the programme all success and acco
rd rny heart-felt greetings to the
organisers and all the artists on the occasion.
३

Yours sincerely,

( K .C. PA NT)

Shri Mohan Upreti
President,
