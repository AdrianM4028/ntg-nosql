Jeetu reaches Taknaur, where his sister is married and falls in love with
Bharna, Shobhini’s sister-in-law. Bharna wants Jeetu to bring her an alpine

antelope. He sets out in the search of the animal and ﬁnds himself in the
“bugyals” (areas endowed with alpine grass). Jeetu settles down for some
rest and plays on his ﬂute _ which brings seven fairies on the scene. Enchanted
by Jeetu’s music, they offer him to take to heaven but Jeetu buys time from
them since he has yet to take his sister home for the sappling ceremony. The
fairies let him off with a warning that they will reappear in Bagudi on the day
and take him away.
Jeetu brings Shobhini to Bagudi, leaving Bharna behind. Shobhini sows
the first sappling on the appointed day when, amidst the festivities, Jeetu
realises that the fairies have indeed come to take him away. He asks everyone
to leave him alone. The fairies come and ask him to accompany them. But.
by now, Jeetu has made up his mind. He would not leave his mother earth at
any cost. The fairies coax him but Jeetu is ﬁrm. They threated him. He is
unmoved. Suddenly. Bharna arrives and sees Jeetu being surrounded by angry
fairies. She tries to prevent them but is killed in the process. The fairies
promise Jeetu that should he agree to come with them, they would bring
Bharana back to life and take her along too. Jeetu refuses this oﬂ'er, reiterating his commitment to the earth. The fairies ﬁnally kill Jeetu.
All that remains in Bagudi is a deadening silence. But Jeetu’s task has
remained unfulﬁlled. His spirit appears, helpless, yet hoping that his land
would regain its splendour. His cry of despair echoes in the distant hills and
a legend is born. IsJeetu’s spirit satisﬁed? No one knows, but one can still
hear him lamenting for his land, his human companies and the natural
surroundings.
