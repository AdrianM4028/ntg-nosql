Refreshingly different version of Mahabharata
This is a show which should be taken around the country for its artistic
excellence and its message.
Patriot (October 31, 1984)
Folk ballads come alive in opera
Parvatiya Kala Kendra. . . has made a novel contribution to the opera stage in
the Capital... Its latest venture—Rasik Ramola—staged . . . to a jam-packed
house is yet another artistic achievement of the Kendra.
Indian Express (October IO, 1985)

Feast for the eyes and ears
Rasik *Ramola is an aural feast and a visul delight... Mythology, legend and
history are inextricably blended . . .in what is essentially a celebration of the spirit
of music...
Hindustan Times (October 14, 1985)
