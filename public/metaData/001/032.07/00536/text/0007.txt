My dear Mohan,
It is a matter of great pride that PARVATIYA KALA KENDRA has
achieved great success in projecting the artistic values and cultural contents of
folk songs and folk dances of Uttrakhand before various audiences both in
Kumaon and Garhwal styles while borrowing generously feom Urdu, Hindi,
Avadhi and Hindustani.
The Ramayana, the Mahabharata and folk songs of India are bound to
invoke interest and appreciation, more so by the fact that the Kala Kendra.
your organisation, has ventured to present the complete “Ramlila”. It is a
matter of great pride that this unique production will involve leading performers
who have earned national and international fame and reputation in dance
festivals in and outside India.
You, Mr. Mohan Upreti, needless to say are the life and soul of this
organisation and have given it not only the content but inspiration to live and
grow inspite of limitations and handicaps which cultural organisations generally
suffer in a. capitalistic and feudal society.

May I wish you and your organisation all success and hope that your
performace will help in producing life and light amidst the all round decadence
through which India is passing today.

With wishes for the success of your endeavours,

Yours sincerely,

(H. N . Bah u gu na)
