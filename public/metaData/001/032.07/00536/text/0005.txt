The Parvatiya Kala Kendra, New Delhi has been engaged for a number of
years in promoting and popularising the folk art of Kumaon and Garhwal hills.
India is a mosaic of different cultural streams. Garhwal and Kumaon regions
have made their own distinctive contribution towards the enrichment of our

national cultural heritage.

I am glad that the Parvatiya Kala Kendra is now

presenting Ramlila in the Uttra Khand style on 9th and 10th November, 1985.
Ramlila connoisseurs of Delhi will ﬁnd that this style of presentation has its
own ﬂavour.
I send my best wishes to the organisers on this occasion.
