RASIK—RAMOLA
THEME AND INTERPRETATION
Mohan Upreti

Ramola ballad is different from other ballads sung in Kumaon and Garhwal
hills, on account of its being a mix of mythology, legend and history. It is a
combination of the heroic with the romantic with a mystical aura surrounding
it. Like all other folk tales, Ramola has also grown with the passage of time

into a saga of the life & culture of the hill people inhabiting Uttarakhand. It
has branched off into a plethora of episodes drawn from different sourcesmythology, history & legend, its span stretching from the Pauranic era to the
medieval period of Indian history, when the central Himalayan regional was

invaded by Rohilla hordes from the plains of Tarai.

The ballad while referring

to Bijamati, the wife of Siduwa Ramola, as Lord Krishna’s sister, sings of

Kalu Vazir as well-a tyrant, ruling Tarai, who invades Ramoligarh to possess

Bijamati.

Such inaccurate interpolations apart, the ballad succeeds in high-

lighting the mystique of man’s eternal relationship with Nature. It goes on to
sing of the beauty of mountains, the sylvan surroundings where rhododendron
ﬂowers blossom, of the fairies who are eternal dwellers of the Himalayas, of
their mystical relationship with Siduwa and Biduwa, heroes of the ballad, who
