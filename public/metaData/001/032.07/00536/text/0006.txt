M E S S AG E
It is a matter of great pleasure that Parvatiya Kala Kendra, Delhi is engaged
in the preservation and popularisation of the folk art of Kumaon and Garhwal
region. India is a mossaic of different cultures and each region lends its own
distinct style to the beauty of the multifaceted culture of India.
I am also happy to know that your organisation has decided to present
complete Ramlila in 3 parts. Ramlila is an integral part of our cultural life.
The whole gamut of human emotion from love and aﬁection, sacriﬁce,

deception and anger have been very vividly portrayed in this great epic.
I send my good wishes on this occasion.
