ROOTED TO THE CORE 100
And headed for the world of the future.
At the core lies a technological strength which has consolidated
BlLT's position as India’s foremost paperrnaker for over six
decades. A strength which propels it into the future.
So that, in 2003 when the Indian paper demand is 5 million

tonnes, BILT will meet it with over 70 percent of the brightest, finest
papers.
And, as South East Asia starts looking towards India-and BILT for paper, the BILT chemistry will be working in yet another area;
India’s largest producer and exporter of phosphoric acid will add
one more link to the value-addition chain by making phosphatic
fertilizer and pesticide intermediates.
Even as it rakes in returns from corporate agriculture, meshing
core strengths with core Indian advantages.
For BILT, it is back to the roots. Or core strengths, as it were.
