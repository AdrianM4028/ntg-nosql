Shri Mohan Upreti, the founder and soul of Parvatiya Kala Kendra was
an institution in himself. I personally came in touch with him during the last
eight years & found in him a loveable & affectionate friend. He was not only
a name & fame in Delhi but throughout the country. The young artistes looked
upon him with great respect & he always bestowed his love & affection to
them.

I have no words to express my personal loss & also a loss to Indian arts

& the country. In Parvatiya Kala Kendra we will always Ô¨Ånd him living &
inspiring the Kendra. Let us join together to pay our homage & also wish

Parvatiya Kala Kendra a grand success in all its efforts.
