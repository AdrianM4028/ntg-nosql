I am happy to know that Partvatiya Kala, Kendra, New Delhi is
organising a colourful programme of Folk songs and Folk dance of
Uttarakhand on the 20 and 21 September, 1997 to commemorate and the
work and achievements of its founder, late Shri Mohan Upreti, who passed

away in June this year.
It is pleasing to note that a beÔ¨Åtting Souvenir is also being brought out
