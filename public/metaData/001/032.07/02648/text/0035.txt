I am very glad to learn thar Paravatiya Kala Kendra is promoting the
cultural heritage of Uttarakhand through its theatrical presentations to
commemorate the memory of Late Shri Mohan Upreti, who was the President
and Founder Member of Parvatiya Kala Kendra, on 20/21 st September'97

Shri Mohanj i has been known to me personally and since he was very
closely associated with 'Shriram Bharatiy Kala Kendra', I can never forget
the valuable contribution that he has made towards the Kendra and towards
the Uttarakhand arts before the public of Northern India.

I do hope on this occasion we will all remember him of the wonderful
work he has done in creating, building up and consolidation the activities of
the Parvatiya Kala Kendra.
Sumitra Charat Ram
