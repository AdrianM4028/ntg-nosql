which in that period disallowed choice of vocation and
freedom of self-expression. It is through great inner struggle

that we were able to seek reconciliation between the two
and if we were not shattered by this conflict, it is primarily
because we stood by each other and gave strength and
support to each other.

Our friendship matured into fruitful collaboration as
adults later in several national assignments. I was
priviledged to have Mohan as a colleague when I headed
the Software Planning Committee for Doordarshan
appointed by Govt. of India during the early eighties. Our
Report gained much from his rich cultural experience and
insights and also his political maturity. Later we were

members that not all representations of sex, man-woman

that the critics should not surrender to prudery and excessive
Puritanism. This will be rejected by our youth today who
are in revolt against the norms of an over-repressed,
conservative society. The Chairperson shot back in
disagreement: "Do you regard the ﬁlm song, Choli Ke
