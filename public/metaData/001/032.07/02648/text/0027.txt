Late Shri Mohan Upreti founder and erstwhile President of Parvati
ya
Kala Kendra had endeavoured to promote and project the cultural
heritage
of Uttarakhand through theoretical presentations and enrich the knowle
dge
in this Vital ﬁeld of human creativity.
It is a matter of satisfaction to learn that Kala Kendra is presenting a
programme of folk songs and dances of Uttarakhand during September 2021, 1997 at New Delhi in memory of their founder.

I trust that the activities of the Kendra will continue to be inspired by
the dedication and commitment of late Shri Upreti.
