MA SSAGE

I am delighted to learn that Parvitaya Kala Kendra of which Shri
Mohan Upreti
is the moving spirit has completed twenty fruitful years of
its existence as a leading

centre of Indian folk art and culture with special focus on Uttara
khand. To the best
of my knowledge such a centre dedicated to the preser
vation and recreation of folk

art and culture suited to the modern context does not
exist elsewhere. It is
unmatched in the contribution that it has already made to
a new cultural renaissance
in India which derives its sustenance from the rich heritage
of the common peasants
and
artisans of India. Moreover this centre has entere
d a new creative path by

presenting in a modern form the great folk epics and ballads
and by introducing the
urban educated intelligentsia to new sources of spiritual regene
ration and enrichment.
It has been my proud privilege to see Shri Moha
n Upreti, the friend of my
younger days, to grow and mature into a cultur
al leader of Uttarakhand and on
that basis also to emerge as a creative individual
of all-India eminence. Members of

his group have also grown and each of them has
acquired a stature of his or her
own. There

is no greater joy in life than to be creative
and to win the sincere and
deep affection and appreciation of one’s own
people through one’s work.

I offer Parvitaya Kala Kendra, Shri Mohan
Upreti and his colleagues

my sincerest
congratuations and greetings. I wish them great
er achievements and successes in the
ﬁeld of folk culture.
