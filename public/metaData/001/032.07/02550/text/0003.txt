Delhi, for helping me in designing the performance and to
Arnbika for designing the contumes. I wish to thank all the
artists and colleagues of the Parvatiya Kala Kendra who
have worked very hard to mount this production. I would
like to emphasise that this venture is not a routine kind of
play, but an attempt to put together in a theatrical frame,
the thoughts, ideas and ideals of Arnir Khusro, as expressed in some of his poems and riddles, in a language
है spoken by common people of India. May this give some
solace and peace to all those who are living in a tension
ridden world.
