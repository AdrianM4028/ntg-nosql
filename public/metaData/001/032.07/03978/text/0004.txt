existence like the umbrella or a pair ofscissors,

and so on. Amir Khusro expressed great truths

in the language of the people — the language
spoken by them in and around Delhi, which
the scholars have called Hindi or Dehalvi. The
presentation ends with complete surrender of
Khusro to his mentor (Peer) - the great Suﬁ
Aulia.

We all know Amir Khusro was not only a great
poet having written copiously in Persian and
Arabic, but also a great musician. My difficul-

ties in composing music for this production
were manifold, as most of the lyrics and
qawalees have been sung by great masters for
several centuries. I decided to keep some as they
are sung in the present form but I have recomposed the others to suit our requirements.

I am grateful to Guru Munna Shukla for hav—
ing agreed to choreograph the dances, to
Prasanna, who is luckily in Delhi, for helping

me in designing the performance and to
Ambika for designing the costumes. I wish to
thank all the artists and colleagues of the
Parvatiya Kala Kendra who have worked very
hard to mount this production. I would like to
emphasise that this venture is not a routine
kind of play, but an attempt to put together in
a theatrical frame, the thoughts, ideas and ide—
als ofAmir Khusro, as expressed in some of
his poems and riddles, in a language spoken
by common people of India. May this give
some solace and peace to all those who are living in a tension ridden world.
