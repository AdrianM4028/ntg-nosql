PARVA'I'IYA KALA KENDRA AND INDIAN THEATRE

During the last nine years, ever since we started working on folk ballads, the Kendra
has been enlarging the scape of. Indian Theatre by adding- anew dimension to it—tthe
dimension of Opera. Iﬁ-rnain'contribution lies - in exploring the possibilities of ballads,
which are an imaginative rnix .of history legded" and myth, created and composed and
nurtured by the various communities spread over the length and breath of our country. In
a way they are oral documents containing reactions as also comments of the common man
on the various twists and turns of human history.

We also strongly feel the need of developing an operatic theatre as distinct from the
musical one, eSpecially in the Hindi heartland. If we glance around we will find that all
the folk & traditional theatrical forms prevalent in the North are operatic in nature, songoriented rather than movement oriented, as they are in the South. This feature should be

given its due place in considering the future course of Indian theatre. We feel, the Parvatiya
Kala Kendra can take legitimate pride in its contribution to the enrichment of this particular
'
stream of Indian Theatre.
