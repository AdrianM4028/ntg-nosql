"O God ! Lead me from darkness to light"
EMan's eternal guest. For light is life. And light is
our business. With a production line of quality torches,
dry cells and miniature bulbs

Right since independence
GEEP’S founder, Late Mr. M.R. Shervani, realised
that portable light source w ll continue to be
one of the basic necessities for hundreds of millons of
Indians, especially where other fruits of
progress will be slower to reach

GEEP is now playing a much wider role
Guided by the philosophy of its founder of delivering
the masses from darkness of fear
ignorance and backwarduess. Subserving
everything else to common good
