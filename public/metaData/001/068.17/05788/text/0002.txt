The Children Theatre Work-Shop
'Theatrevin- Education—1993
If the youths and children of our Soceity turn their faces

away from theatre, it Will not only make the dramatic field
barren, but it will inevitably give a booster to anti-culture
activities, when the CommunalisUm is a. burning question
to our Soceity.
But Why the School Students हूँ? That the modern day schools
are synonymous with machines where students are subjected
to a. mechanical rate race.

The main ObjectiVe of Our Work—shOp is to bu:ld up the
physical, mental and Spiritual growth through games and
improvisations.

They will learn how to create the move-

ments, role playing, Music and other activities.

One should

accept the other Community, the work-shOp will enrich
them how to keep the harmony.
