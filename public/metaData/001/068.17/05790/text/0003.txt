The Red Oleanders
Rabindranath Tagore

There was a time when, in human world, most of our important dealings with
our fellow— beings were personal dealings, and professional element in society
was never hugely disproportionate to the normal constitution of its life.
Today another factOr has made itself immensely evident in shaping and: guiding
human destiny. It is the spirit of organisation, which is not social in character,
but utilitarian. But the personal man is not dead, only dominated by organised
man. The View that today we see a titanic power with endless curiosity to analyse
and know, but without sympathy to understand; with numberless arms to coerce

and acquire, but no serenity of soul to realise and enjoy.

It is an organised passion of greed that is stalking does not represent the whole
truth as to its character. Such an objective passion lacks the true majesty of
human nature; it only assumes a terrifying bigness, its physiognomy blurred
through its cover of an intricate netWork … the scientific system. It barricades
itself against all direct human touch with barriers of race pride and prestige of
power. Now we have an organised avarice — frightfully simple in its purpose,
mechanically complicated in its process.
Nandini is the heroine of this play, has definite features of an individual person.
She is not an abstraction, but persuaded by an abstraction, like one tormented

by a ghost. And this is the drama. Nandini is a real woman who knows that
wealth and power are maya, and that the highest expression of life is in love,

which manifests in this play in her love for Ranjan. But love—ties are ruthlessly
molested by megalomaniac ambition, while an acquisitive intellect plies its
psychological curiosity, probing into the elusive mystery of love through
vivisection.
I have a strong faith in the simple personality of man than its proliﬁc brood
of machinery that wants to crowd it out. This personality — the divine essence
of the infinite in the vessel of the ﬁnite — has its last treasure—house in woman’s
heart. Her pervading influence will someday restore the human to the desolated
world of man. The woman will one day prove that the meek in soul, through
the sure power of love, will rescue this world from the dominance of the

unholy spirit of rapacity. The joy of this faith has inspired me to pour all my
heart into painting against the back ground of black shadows — the nightmare
of a devil’s temptation — the portrait of Nandini as the bearer of message of
reality, the saviour through death.
