"नुदृ' You're right. Pantomime is

a dumb performance. No
Words. Just gestures
.. conveying a world of
eXpression. Now. the
vital question. Can
language ever be
expressed without
words? Yes Look at your

own life. In fact, the
language of gesture is
universal. A curling of the
lips. An enlargement of
the eyelids in a rage of
terripe‘r.--Gnashing of
teeth as a prelude to a
blow. And myriads'of
other gestures. The
१ language is inaudible
But the message is clear
as crystal.

Pantomime is one of the
most ancient and most
difficult-art forms in
theatre. It can be traced
back to the earliest
annals of our cultural
heritage.
ln Bharata's Natyasastra,
the finer aspects of role
playing were discussed
under Mudras. The
gresent form of
antornime has basically
evolved from the
Kudiattarn. Kathakali and
from the repository of
ancient Sanskrit drama.
The Pantomime artiste.
however. is in constant

quest to add fineness to
this intricate language of
gesture to develop it as
one of the highest art
forms. Pantomime today
is a touching. moving *
expression of “love. hate.
joy. and more'. In fact. '
the entire kaleidoscope
of feelings. emotions.
situations — be it '
physical. spiritual.
natural. supernatural.
