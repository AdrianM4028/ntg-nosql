Therefore, even now ’B-huter Begar’ remains very relevant. if not contemporary

There were many matters, of course, which have become obsolete and irrelevant
So, Jochhon Dastidar, the well-known dramatist and director had to omit some
some portion, and alter its form of presentation to make it more contemporary while
retaining the main characters, the episodes, and the dialogues so that the original
flavour ramains intact,

Ananda Baanerji, one of the early elits, started his career as an Agent of British
Capital, as most of the Indian Capitalists did, He tried to be as loyal to British
Capitalist Mr. Bawell as he could. He was swindled and so he became temporarily
anti- British. But, he discovered, he had learned the art :of swindling from his master.
So he became a worthy successor in the ‘great art’ of exploiting his own people.
