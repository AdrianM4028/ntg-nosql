Yesterday today and.-........, …..

On 4th July 1960, a group of young and determined enthusiasts
founded “Rupantry” with the avowed objective of putting on stage the
sorrows and joys of the common people of our land through dramatic
performances.

Its first. public performance was a manuscript drama “ Bingshottari ”
written and directed by a young but well-known playwright actor
Jochhon Dastidar, around whom was formed this cultural organisation.
Since then hundreds of performances have been staged in West Bengal
‘and outside.

But the basic character of the plays staged have always

in line with Rupantari‘s original objective. This was made possible
because in this fonrteenth years of life Rupantari has staged only
original plays written by members of Rupantari.

gradually earned a place in the heart of the Bengali people.
Rupantri also had the unique distinction of making a 45 minute long
