Even Kaliram, में the newly appointed servant of the house took

up Dashu as the puppet of his cruel jokes.

He pursuaded Dashu

that Amita, Anjali’s unmarried sister was in. love with him, though
he was well aware that Amita was to marry Tapan, an accomplished
youth who often Visited t he house.

Amita’s compassion for the crippled—so unlike her sister’s

burning hatred tended to give colour to the story and Dashu’s love
for Amita reached a pitch where he couldn’t abide even the sight of
Tapan, and his spirits sunk into the depths of melancholia.
What had happened them ? A Watch within.
