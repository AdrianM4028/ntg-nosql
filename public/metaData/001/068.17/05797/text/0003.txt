CHATURMUKH "is now at
the preliminary stage of its pre-

paration to stage Tagore’s
CHA’I‘URANGA. One of the
ablest group of young men ofBengal is associated with its
production. Moreover,

CHATURMUKH is planning
to hold a Theatrical Carnival
of the famous dramas of the
५ world within the following two
years. The dramatic association
’ of CHATURMUKH intends
to stage the Bengali adaptations

. of some best dramas "ol: the
world, keeping in tact their
essential themes and sentiments.
The preparations have already
»
started.
We are now making ourselves
ready to publish a journal as
an organ of CHATURMUKH
in which prominence will be

given to the. understanding of
cultural ३ Art in the perspective

' of modern values.
The greatest satisfaction for
the creation of Art is the
appreciation of the spectators.
We have said many things so

long. Now being associated पृ
personally with our work you

will judge where we stand.
CHATURMUKH, a drama-

tic club, was established in
.
1959.
We have selected this com-

through the urge of our hearts.
This urge accelerated gradually
by the combined efforts of
some young persons. As the
result we have been able to
present to the pubic of West
Bengal: NACHIKETA,
NIRBODH, JANAIKER '
MRI'I‘YU and PATANER
PAR. Our urge for dramatic
performances has gradually
_
increased by our successes one
after another.
३
We are the ﬁrst in West
Bengal to earn the glory of
staging a fullﬂedged drama
of Brecht. We have presented
to the audience an adaptation
9f St. Joan of the Stockyards _
by Brecht.
CHATURMUKH is asso- _
ciated with various dramatic ’
movements so we had to face
many attacks and pass over
many difﬁculties. The success
we achieved against the struggle
and opposition from the profes' sional Theatrical companies is
manifested by our staging regularly JANAIKER MRI’I‘YU
in the Sishmahal Theatre of
Howrah. And now it has been

‘ ' proved that a good drama is
always appreciated and at every
place.
