A Scene from Seeta

The play is based on the great epic of
Ramayana specially glorifying the character
of Seeta as an ideal mother. It ends with the
following words addressed to Lava and Kusha
after Seeta disappeared in mother-earth "Rise,
be firm, go ahead with your duty. Bow down
your heads here and your obeisance will
reach your mother‘s feet. Make this world
graceful

for

and serve

its

peace

and

prosperity' ' .
The mother and the motherland are
superior to heaven, the kingdom of God
even.
