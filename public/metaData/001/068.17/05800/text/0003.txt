Aladin....Can compare with the best of
Russian Obraztsov, Czech marionettes and the
Australian string operated Tintookies seen
before in Bombay.

The puppet drama Aladin is. as the magic
lamp....it evokes surprise, delight, anguish
and at a time breathless excitement....it looks
an Eastman colour movie.
