National Puppet Academy
A Project of Calcutta Puppet Theatre

All over the country today there are
Institutes for drama, dance and music, some
of fairly high standard under private or
Government management; Many of the
Universities have a drama faculty also. But
unfortunately there is no recognised institution

in India where puppetry is taught exclusively
through an organised course, nor any scientific research and study has ever been
conducted on this subject. In no University
in India, including those for drama and theatre
even, puppetry so far has a place as a subject
in degree course not to speak of post
graduate level.

Some efforts have of course

been made by distinguished individuals in the
field of puppetry to develop this art form
further, in modern context and their achive—
ments are not negligible. But still there is
ample scope to develop and utilise this art as
medium for healthy entertainment as well as
social education specially for children and
non—literate adults.
Hence, Calcutta Puppet Theatre has come

forward with a project of a National Puppet
Academy, an institution of complete education
in puppetry, both in theory and practice with
other academic activities like research and
study.
Calcutta Puppet Theatre with all
its achievements for a decade and with Shri
Suresh Dutta, a pioneer in the field as its
director may modestly claim to have the
competence to promote a project for National
Puppet Academy. Calcutta being a city of
theatres rightly deserves to be the centre for
the Academy.
National Puppet Academy will start its
journey soon and let all of us hope that it will
reach its desired goal in no time.
Before closing we make a fervent appeal to
the theatre lovers of India, Government of India
and all State
Governments to come forward

with generous help in both money and materials,
to implement this ambitious scheme as an ideal
Puppet Academy.
