M Padatik Cultu
The rapid expansion of Padatik necessitated the formation of an official body which
would superintend and supervise its affairs. Hence, the setting up of the Padatik Cultural
Centre - a public foundation created for the promotion and development of art and culture. It contains within its premises, a reception, a reharsal-roorn, a guest-room, an office.
the director's room, besides an air-conditioned Mini-theatre and an outdoor stage, where

dance, theatre and music shows ate

held

front time to

time.

The

Padatik Cultural

Centre also has 'plans of establishing professional theatre repertories and dance-compa-

nies, hold art-exhibitions and organise documentation of dance-forms, particularly those
which need a helping hand. Acclaimed by one and all who have performed

here the

Padatik Little auditorium with an audience capacity of 50, was inaugurated with the kind

blessings of Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra in November, 1983. An interesting concept, opâ€œerating on the same principles as the indoor studio, the outdoor stage in Padatik complex

has the additional advantage (than

the

indoor air-conditioned auditoria) of

being

open-air. Several productions and workshops are held here particularly in winter. The
outdoor stage has seating arrangement for about 100 People.
