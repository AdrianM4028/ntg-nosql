DHARMAGHAT
Though written seventeen years ago it is still
the play of the day. The exploitation of Labour
has not disappeared and. Sabotaging of the
solidarity of Labour by a Policy of “Divide and
Rule" and that on communal lines is still the
trick of the Enemies of the People.
DHARMAGHAT or STRIKE is a drama in four
scenes which describes how a contemplated
strike by the w0rkers of an Umbrella-Waterproof
Factory was almost sabotaged by one of the
workers who acted as an agent of the employer.

The employer had adopted the “divide and rule"
policy, dividing the workers along communal
llnes raislng a false scare that a

girl of one

community had been abducted by a young man
of another. When much damage was done to
either community through violence, loOting,
arson and such other crimes, the secret hand
behind all these was exposed and the mistake
regretted. While the workers once more'stand
united in their demand for no retrenchment, the
agent who had stOoped to play a nefarious game

for personal gain is isolated

after a

humiliation.
