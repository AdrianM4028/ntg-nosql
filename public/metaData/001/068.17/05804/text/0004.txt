A few words more. Be it noted that I am no director of this Play in the
conventional sense. Then, one may ask, why these ‘Words, words, words“ :
Simply because, in every social happening, the seniormost happens to be the
spokesperson, not because he or she is the worthiest. I have only tried to
remain the ‘Spectator idealised’ while my young colleagues played the
dangerous yet divine game of theatre. If there is anything good in it, the credit
goes to them. In the process, the young of Nandikar have achieved
independence. Not bad : I only wish they wouldn’t stop at that : they would
strive after freedom, — freedom that teaches us to care for others along with
one’s own.
