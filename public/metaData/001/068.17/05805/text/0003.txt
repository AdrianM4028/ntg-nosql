jurri ( जुडि ) of the old Jatra, it sings,
A play does not necessarily " mean
that there should be a number of
characters in it. As a matter of fact, in
the days of yore, it is said, a play used
to consist of a single character only.

and also, occasionally, it provides the
basis for attaining denouement through
acting. The play has been mounted in
the style of Kathakata. । myself am the
Kathak, and off and on, I’m one or other
character of the play.
All theatre-workers must be knowing how difficult these theatre works
have now-a—days been. . Nothing but
concerted effort allows one to survive.
Apart from this, there is a host of problems, naming the spiring cost of
Theatre-hire, ever-increasing publicity
cost, scarcity of stage, etc.
But despite everything theatre must

go on. On the verge of my setting out
for this inevitable journey । count upon
your well wishes.
