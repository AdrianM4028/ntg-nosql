D IRE C T OR’ 5 NOTE
Dr. Shanker Shesh’s PHANDI advocate the cause of Euthanasia (happy death)
vis-a-vis the law of the land.

Phandi, the person accused of murdering his father, is facing

trial for the willful act/crime, he is alleged to have committed in full awareness.

The legal

battle in the court is inconclusive, as the law does not legalise the murder despite the fact that

this has relieved the patient of his perpetual agony on the eve of terminal illness.

Dr. Shesh has woven the theme around the consultation-room of the prison and the
court-room through three characters, i e , the accused, his lawyer and jail warder.

These

characters adapt themselves to number of characters while moving in their imaginations
retrospection and ﬂash-backs.

I have, however, taken the liberty of separating these char-

acters by adding various other actor in order to gain variety and disparity without disturbing

the fabric and ﬂow of the play.

In the ﬁnal analysis the ball is in the court of law where new

challenges are accepted, social complexities are scrutinized and rational verdict in formulated

The play, therefore, serves only as a pointer.

A cause is pleaded with justiﬁcation

and rationale but avoides ﬁnality as the verdict does not fall under the jurisdiction of social
thought. Dr. Shesh was a social thinker and his medium of communication was the theatre.
Vidushak will try to take over the production of some other plays by Dr. Shesh.
