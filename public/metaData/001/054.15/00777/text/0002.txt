Director’s Note on Production

Surendra Verma’s NAYAK KHALNAYAK VIDUSHAK
is brilliant in more than one way. The play portrays hard
realities of life of the man in socio-economic-political set up, his
illusions of rectitude and his helplessness in situations. Nonetheless, the play has a lyrical quality with speeches full of nuances
and music.
I do confess that the production was a little tough for the
present generation of amateur actors. They had to cope with the
spoken structure with great stress and strain. The play also
demanded restraint in expression and other modes of communication. In totality it had to be rather in a low key. It, thus,
required sense of judgement, proportion and arrangement at
every step of creativity.
Anyway, another eﬂbrt has been made by the team of
Vidushak with sincerity and diligence. The production may bear
testimony to this.
