DIRECTORâ€™S NOTE

In the past, I have always preferred to produce original Hindi plays

but a recent experience has made me apprehensive.

My venturing of such

plays may lead to the confrontation between myself and the playwright.
When the playwright does not favour even the slightest departure from the

original text, except the editing, the director is likely to be at a disadvantage

creatively.

He feels restricted and tied down with the text.

I would not

like myself to be charged with mauling the play despite my gocd intentions.

This is one of the reasons that I have to lean upon adaptation of western

play, although the adaptations have been my last resort.

I do not rule out adaptation of plays from different languages.

Emotions are basically and universally the same in human being, varying
only in d>grees of expression.

Human nature, however complicated or

discernible, remains the same, though displayed through different behaviour
patterns.

As such, the adaptation is not merely a change of language but

demands overhauling of content to suit the milieu for which it is to be
presented.

Effort has been made to keep the spine of the play intact and

the movement of the plot absorbing and interesting.
