Director’s Note on Production

‘Nishacher' is Hindi version of Utpal Dutt's Bengali play ‘Ghoom Nai’.
The play exposes the tyranny of money power over human lives wherein
various events culminate into a tragedy.

The theme of the play is woven around lnder Lal, an urnernployed driver
who falls victim to the lure of money in the face of grave ﬁnancial crisis and
utter humiliation from his wife. In desperate bid to earn money, he stakes
his life and meets his tragic death.

Actually, all the characters in the play are utterly human with varying
shades of virtues and vices. The truck drivers, for instance, with different
backgrounds, temperament and aspirations are united by a lowest common
denominator—the problem of survival which in their lives is always in
jeopardy. Their strength lies unitedly in confrontation against exploitation,
injustice and corrupt practices.

The play was perhaps written about two decades ago but it is still relevant to the present day social structure. The play serves not only as a mirror
of society, but also motivates social criticism of the malaise suffered by one

and all.

Most of the actors in the cast are young and new to the theatre. It is
happy feeling to write on a clean slate. I prefer to work with fresh talents,
as it is easier to moulds them according to the demands of the play.

Limitations notwithstanding, they have worked with understanding and

sincerity to bring forward the production on the stage. Whatever be the outcome of our efforts, there always be much to be achieved which we go on
aspiring in our endeavours.
