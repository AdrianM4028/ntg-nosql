Miller’s Collected Plays appeared in 1957 and he wrote an Introduction to it which
lucidly expounds his convictions as a man and as a dramatist. After the Fall and Incident At
Vichy were both staged in 1964 and The Price in 1968.
in 1945.

His only novel, Focus, was published

A writer with strong social and political commitments, Miller frequently faced difﬁculties with conservative and reactionary circles in America. The State Department denied him

a passport on one occasion, and the New York City Youth Board investigated his Communist
associations in 1955. When questioned by the House Committee on Uri-American Activities,
Miller refused to mention the names of persons he had seen at Communist meetings on the
ground that it violated his conscience. This stand made him romething of a hero among
American liberals. Miller was found guilty of contempt of Congress but challenged the verdict
in the United States Court of Appeals and was allowed to maintain the position he had taken
up. The University of Michigan awarded Miller an honorary degree. The National Institute
of Arts and Letters elected him a member and gave him its Gold Medal for Drama in 1959,

From 1965 to 1969, he was president of the P.E.N., an international organization of writers
with branches in most countries; including India. Millers has featured in a number of interviews, produced outstanding essays and autobiographical statements and some short stortes.
He is also the author of radio and screen plays. Several books have been written on him, a

score of doctoral theses and more than a hundred major articles
