If any people choose to think of me, then I should
like them to say; “This was the man who, with all his mind
and heart loved India and the Indian People. And they, in turn
were indulgent to him and gave him of their love most abundantly

and extravagently”.

“And so we have to labour and work, and work hard

to give reality to our dreams

Those dreams are for India, but

they are also for the world, for all nations and peoples are too
closely knit together today for any one of them to imagine that
it can live apart. Peace has been said to be indivisible, so is
freedom, so is prosperity now, and so also is disaster in this one

world that can no longer split into isolated fragments”.
