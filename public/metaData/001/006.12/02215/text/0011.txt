“ The Gems of my Quest ”
These are some excerpts from “ My Life in Art ”
by Konstatin Stainslavsky
“the great Actor of Russian Stage. रे
The actor.

“ l he actor must live among people and draw from them the necessary
creative
material

“ An actor is capricious and whisical, and one must know how to handle him "r
No leaving on chances.

“ Nine tenths of an actor’s work, nine-tenths of everything lies in feeling the role
spiritually, in living it. When this is done, the role is almost ready. It is senseless to
bank on simple accident ”.
Secret of theatre art.

" The stage artiste must be the master of his own inspiration and must know how
to call it forth at the time announced on the theatre’s posters. This is the Chief secret
of our art ”.
Director ! an unpleasant Job.
“ A director must have authority, and at that time I did not have it. I stimulao
ted everyone with my fanatical love of work, my ability to work, and my strictness,
especially to myself. The ﬁrst person I ﬁned was myself. 1 cruelly punished people
for being late for rehearsals, for not learning their part, for talking during work, for
leaving the rehearsal hall without permission ”.
Inspiration reveals nobility.
“ In moments of inspiration, when, for some inexplicable reason, one feels not
the conception of the words themselves but the deep meaning that is hidden in them,
one ﬁnds the simplicity and nobility for which one has searched. In such moments the
voice reverberatcs and becomes musical ”.
Theatre demands collective toil.

“ People who love and understand what they are jointly creating will always know
how to get along. Shame on those who cannot achieve that, who pursue not the basic,
mutual aim, but their own personal one which they love more than collective work!
Art cannot thrive in such conditions and it is no use speaking about it ”.
