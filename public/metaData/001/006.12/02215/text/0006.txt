Whose tragedy it is ? Antigone’s ? Creon’s ? Probably it is of both. It is a
conﬂict between the devotion of a virgin martyr and 3 King’s love of law. Who

. A word about the Chorus.

The Chorus in the play is a vestige of religious

rites. The Chorus speaks the thoughts of the ideal spectator. Aristotle’s remark
that “the Chorus should be regarded as one of the Characters” is rather more
acceptable. That is why the Chorus in this production has been reduced to a single
voice.
Two thousand four hundred and eight years after its ﬁrst production in
Athens, we venture to recreate again the subtle and human conﬂict involved.

With

all humility and earnestness we present this evening CAN'I'IGONE, a problem play,
a great tragedy by Sophocles that has stood the test of centuries.
