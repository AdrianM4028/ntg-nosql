Her tomorrow
ncer n _

today
What will she wear when
she grows ?
This was precisely our thought in 1962

Added to all this, we are marketing

when we set up a small plant to
manufacture Jaykaylon nylon yarn.
For, soon cotton was sure to find itself
in shortage. Moreover, it might not
cater to her new contemporary life-style.
Today, Jaykaylon yarn is used in the
manufacture of a wide range of
products. its synthetic fibre and
filament yarn for textiles. Industrial
fibre for defence and industrial
end-products. And tyre-cord for tyres.

process know-how for nylon and
polyester. We have just concluded
agreements for two plants. One at
home under the co-operative sector
for polyester. The other in Kenya for
nylon/polyester yarns.
Truly, our thought of 1962 continues
to obsess us . . . her tomorrow is
certainly our concern today ।
