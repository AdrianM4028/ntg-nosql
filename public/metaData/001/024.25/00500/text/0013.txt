about Bajikar
AJIKAR by Jatu Bandopadhaya, is the story of a juggler troupe or
rather a juggler troupe-owner whose doom is imminent, machinations
of a scheming rival ! Gagan the juggler troupe-owner (‘Master’ in the
troupe) has nothing new to offer to his spectators who ﬂock to the shows
of ‘Madan’ a former disciple of Gagan, not so much because of any
excellence of the performance but mostly because of the attraction of
female performances in that troupe ! Gagan’s troupe is on the verge of
extinction, with the entire troupe in a pitiable state of distress. Then
suddenly, the clown twins of the troupe contrive a plan to rescue their
troupe in a desperate move.......... ..the plan, surprisingly, succeeds but
the price of success is over whelrning,
