about Abirer Rang Lal
ABIRER RANG LAL

by

the eminent Bengali stage personality.

AmarGangopadhay, is a bitter revelation of the fact that even
festivities cost money that not many can afford.

The gaity and zest of

festivals brighten the spirits of those who have the resources to celebrate

but to the more

unfortunate

ones, these

festivals have no

signiﬁcance.

The festival of colour loses all its colour to the cheerless, colourless
and miserable folks !

The

colour

dust——‘Abir’ does

not lend the

splended colour to the wretched lives of these hapless people as it would
to a more afﬂuent being.... ..

Sandhya, a sensitive young girl and Mini, her little

sister, are

both too aware of their in-capacity to afford the luxury of celebrating
the ‘Holi’ festival, with their ailing mother, a helpless father and a
devoted brother of very limited means whose perpetual endeavour is to

keep them happy.

Their well wishing neighbour, Shiben Babu also

fails to brighten the dampened spirits of these tender ones, Sandhya’s
lover Pulak too tries best to cheer them up.

Then, suddenly—the Sun

rises in all its splendour dispelling the clouds of gloom.
