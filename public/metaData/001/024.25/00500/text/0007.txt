Sardar Amjad Ali

99, SOUTH AVENUE
NEW DELHI - 11

MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
(RAJYA SABHA)

Dated the 6th September, 72.

I am glad that Members of Kaal Chakra are going to
celebrate its annual function on the 10th September 1972.

It is also very inspiring that a drama on this blessed
occasion will be staged and members of the club will
participate in the various roles.
“A nation is known by its theatre” was a Wise saying
and I believe it is still so. When life has become so

complicated in this materialistic world its expression
through some personnel on the stage definitely reveals
the various forces that make man a rational creature.
I wish all success to Kaal Chakra.

Sardar Amjad Ali.
