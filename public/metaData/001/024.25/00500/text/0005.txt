September 8, 1972

I am glad to learn that Kaal Chakra is staging a
Bengali Drama “Banglar Mukh” 0n the occasion of Club’s
annual day celebration on Sunday the 10th of September, 1972.
It is particularly heartening to note that they have selected

a drama which depicts the freedom movement of Bangladesh
with all the attended sufferings of the peOple at the hands’
of the brutal Pakistani armed forces.

The great people of

India have been with us throughout the period of our struggle

for liberation and they have made great sacrifices in the
process of the attainment of the freedom of our seventyfive
million people.

The people of Bangladesh and India are great friends
today.

This

friendship has been cemented by sacrifices of

blood by people on both sides of the border.
natural that this spirit

It

is only

of friendship and c00peration

‘will continue and the bond between Bangladesh and India
will be further strengthened through the efforts of
organisaticns like Kaal Chakra.
anxious

India and Bangladesh are

to have durable peace in the sub—continent and to

that end all.our efforts today are directed.

‘

The people of

Bangladesh are confident that they shall be able to move
forward hand in hand with their great Indian friends towards
peace, prosperity and happiness.

I wish the organisation all success.
