Naroker Adhishwar

‘Naroker Adhishwar’ or the ‘Overlord of Hell’ exposes the treachery which
most of the ‘peoples leaders’ play on the sincere faith and unshakable

loyalty of the voters.

The play depicts the despicably ugly private liVeS

of these men against their virtuous pedagogy in public Charged by an

unlimited ambition and lust for power, these men make a mockery of the
ethics of electoral sanctity

which the people of modern times are too

distressineg acquainted with .
The characters are all involved in a f'everist pitch of electioneering campaign
on the eve of an

election and the confrontation of the two election

candidates bring out the worst in them.

The play ends with the warning

that the days of political blasphemy and perﬁdy was coming to an end and
a new age is emerging ....... ..
