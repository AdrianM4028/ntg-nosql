It is India that gave man
the Ingenious method of
counting all numbers by ten

symbols and freed him from
the bondage of counting on
his fingers.
Among these symbols the

thousand years later that
Muhammcd lbn Musa
al-Khawarazmi introduced
them to Baghdad. from
where they found their way
to Europe.
Lending mathematical
computations ease and
simplicity, these symbols
made possible the
calculation of what before
was incalculable.
Over the ages man's

methods of solving

him to make - intricate

calculations in billionths of
a second. Making it possible
for him to attack problems

in ways never possible
before.
With computers.
We are proud that IBM
introduced the

manufacturing of computers
and other data processing
equipment in India, which
are helping the nation meet

the challenge of building a
new tomorrow.
