Bhajo-Kerosene
by

R A JAT G H()SH

In an underdeveloped country the masses face

innumerous problems,

amongst which are scarcity, draught, starvation and poverty.
I 0 add to the misery is the ever increasing population and the queue
for all the essential commodities.

Man becomes compulsorily a part of

this Immense rat-race. While his very existence is at stake there are others
who thrive in business while prices spiral.
The author has woven his theme on these issues and portrayed in a
humorous manner the agony of the general mass. The entire situation is
built up merely in a queue for Kerosene. The characters have various
problems but cannot escape from the pressing problems of Scarcity. Oh'~
where is the end of the increasing queue... ?
