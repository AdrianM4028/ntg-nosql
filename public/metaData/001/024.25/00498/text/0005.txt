“Kaal Chakra” has made a mark in the sociocultural lif'e of the Capital. An organisation of the
Bengali speaking population of Delhi, it has, during the
past decade and a half and more, enlivened the public
through its varied social and cultural activities. I am

happy to learn that next month “Kaal Chakra” will
celebrate its 18th anniversary and on this occasion stage
“Daansagar”, a Bengali adaptation of Prem Chand’s
“Kaf'an”. I hope that the presentation of this piece will
be a histrionic success and make a signiﬁcant impact
on the audience.

I have great pleasure in oﬁerning “Kaal Chakra"
my best wishes and felicitation on this occasion of its
18th anniversary.
