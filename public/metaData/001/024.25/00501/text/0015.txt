about

THE

man

TUGHLUQ

in

him

dreamt of a new world for his people where

they would live in prosperity and where relig
ion would not form
barriers amongst them.............. his heart was
full of compassion

and humane instincts for them Yet, the
emperor in him
aspired to rule by the sword and foulest intrigues.
He wanted to
create history for himself, by himself alone!
The name of

MUHAMMED TUGHLUQ

today is synonymous of

royal eccentricity............... a versatile scholar, a devou
tly religious
man, a ruthless enemy, a self-centred egotist,
balanced by a
secular outlook and an amazing foresight! His was
a lonesome

journey,

with only his

devoted aide and chief of intelligence,

MUHAMMED NAJIB by his side a historian,
BARNI helplessly following TUGHLUQ’s activities!

ZlAUDDlN

Suddenly, the futility of his ambitious actions dawns
with the
revelation that he is a weary traveller in the lonely woods...........
.
with miles to walk!
