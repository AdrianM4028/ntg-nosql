amateur

Bengali dramatic iclub will

annual day shortly and

celebrate

its

be

marked by the staging of

Girish Karnad’s

Kaal Chakra has been

movement in

rendering

notable service to the Bengali theatre

On the occasion of the Club's

annual day | send my best wishes for its continued success.
