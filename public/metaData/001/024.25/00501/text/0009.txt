I am delighted to know that ‘Kaal Chakra’ intends to present my
play, ‘Tughluq’, in Bengali on 25 and 26 August.

I am

grateful to your

Club for the honour you have done to me by choosing my play for
performance and send you my Best Wishes.

I believe the play wright should confine his message to

his play

and not pursue the poor audience with wise words even outside the
auditorium.
