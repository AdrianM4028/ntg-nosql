1981

KAAL CHAKRA founded in 1961 is twenty years old today. Kept alive
through the years by a dedicated group of theatre enthusiasts, it has been
a long way from its first production
‘BARO BHOTAY'
1961 to
‘NEELER PAALA’ 1981.

Drama today is not a form of entertainment alone. It has widened its
sphere considerably to become a powerful medium of communication and it is
with this relevance in mind that Kaal Chakra selects its productions and is
organizing this exhibition to depict the dynamice development of “Theatre in
the seventies."
