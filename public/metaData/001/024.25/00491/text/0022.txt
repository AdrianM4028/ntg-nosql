Girish Karnad’s Kannada play ‘TUGHLAQ’ is many
ways the most signiﬁcant piece of dramatic writing in
this country in two decades. It has been translated into
many languages and staged at many places. In Delhi
alone at least three versions in Urdu

and one in

Kannada have been seen. It was gratifying, therefore
to see it staged in Bengz-li by KAAL CHAKRA on
Sunday night at the Fine Arts Theatre.
The Director Ajoy Chatterjee who plays the main
role is able to bring out the duality of Tughlaq’s ideas
and personality. He creates a character in which the
visionary and the eccentric are constantly present and
visible. It IS a well conceived peice of characterization

and the presentation at times is moving. The setting
by Ajit D utta and Mani Shahani is functional and neat.
Asit Kumar Mitra’s lighting is effective. On the whole
it is very creditable for an Amateur group to present
such a difﬁcult play with such seriousness and devotion.
