nineteenth century.

Ghosh, is set in the second half of the

Forced to cultivate indigo, neel, rather than more proﬁtable

paddy by oppressive ‘neelkar sahibs’, paid a price which did not cover even the
cost of cultivation and inspired by rebellions like the Sepoy Mutiny, the farmers

of Bengal replied with the so-called ‘indigo riots’.
The story is simple.

Mothur Biswas, the head of the peseants of Damor-

hudda and adjoining villages refuses to cultivate indigo for Hills, the ‘neelkar
sahib’.

Hills retalitates by setting ﬁre to his house and by abducting his young

daughter-in-law, to get her back Mathur is forced to take up indigo cultivation.
Aided by Shibnath Bonnerjee, a psendo-proyressive local young man, Mothur
ﬁles a case against Hills.

When in spite of all evidence to the contrary, the

English magistrate declares Hills free of guilt, the peseants take the law into their
own hands and revolt.
The play mirrors the plight of all indigo-growing villages of Bengal as

mirrored in one. The characters are of a type—Hills, the tyrranical Englishman,
the magistrate, concientious but unirnaginative, Kushum, the village prostitute

abducted and raped by the Englishman when young, the villagers and Shibnath

Bonnerjee, a member of the middle class who did so much to highlight their
plight.

Finally, the play brings to light the tentative winds of change blowing

even in this rural community.

In the end, Mothur’s daughter-in-law ushers in the new era in the form of
her child.
