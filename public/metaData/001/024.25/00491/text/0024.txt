Kaal Chakra has also taken the initiative in instituting a cash award in memory of its vice-president the

late Dr. Ashok Kumar Ghosh to be presented to a
veteran stage artiste for his/her contribution to the
enrichment of local Bengali stage. The ﬁrst award was
given to the veteran theatreman Gangadas Guha who
pioneered amateur theatre activity in the city in 1972.

.... ..for the ﬁrst time Nobel Prize winner-author-poet
and play—wright Par Fabian Lagerkvist’s work has been

brought on the stage, the sole credit for introducing
him goes to Kaal Chakra which in the past had been
responsibie for introducing many others.
The play not only has tremendous compression but
also retains Lagerkvist’s clarity of construction. The
production as directed by Ajoy Chatterjee exploded on
the stage with an elemental passion, intellectual
symmetry and ironic perception. Superny memorable
in detail and haunting to the core, its basically
melodramatic stuff transformed themselves into ruthless
geometry of fate. The cast was strong and the

paeformance superbly realized.
