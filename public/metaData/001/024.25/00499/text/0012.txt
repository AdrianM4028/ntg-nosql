In a country like India where more than half the people live below the
poverty line there can be no other aSpect of politics except the “politics
of abject poverty".
For the past thirty years of monolithic rule, the only game played was
the race for “bread and butter" and the ruling elite has used this as an

issue to sustain its power and create illusions. But what goes on in the
core of the masses ? The rot has set in and frustration looms large amidst
the yonth who are caught in the mid-stream of old and new values.
The most ironical part of one of the worlds largest democracies is
that her people have no political alternative.

] 970— Bengal, did try to provide one—the left alternative. But with
dire consequences. There was a mushroom growth of Marxist oriented
parties which sought “not to interpret the world but to change it".

The play depicts Calcutta admidst those hectics politic
al upheavals
and refers to one such movement which sought to destroy the old guard,
break all “bourgeois” notions and create a new world. A movement which
brought in its spate a multitude of intelligent youth totally dedicated and
selﬂess. But inspite of so much blood spilled and ink spent what became
of it? What went wrong? Society and the “bourgeois leadership” remained
sta.ic except for those young adventurists who rotted in the jails totally
shattered .. no one to own them. On their release they found a loss of
identity, They could not join with the ‘old guard' and the new leadership
was adopting a compromising line. Why then did the young ones sacriﬁce
so much? For whom? Is it not time that all those who are protagonists
of a left movement come together and unite so that

these faceless youth

ﬁnd an identity, an ideal, a path which will lead to the true liberation of
s o cie ty ?
