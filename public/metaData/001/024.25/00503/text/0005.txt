about Kaal Chakra

KAAL CHAKRA or the Wheel of Time
which is the emblem of the Club, represents
the true

character of the organisation. It

symbolises the Club’s keen endeavour to
keep its dramatic ideas and cultural outlook
abreast with the cyclic motion of the wheel
of time.

‘Kaal Chakra’ was established by some young drama
enthusiasts of the Capital in the year 1961. Thus the ‘wheel’
was set in motion and the institution began its mission in

presenting dramatic entertainment in all its tenets—comedy,
tragedy, serio-co mic, social and political. Its plays have dealt

with subjects on rural settings, social and political satire, social
reforms, life in coalnmines etc. The club has participated
in several well-known dramatic competitions in the country
and won unqualiﬁed acclaim from drama lovers.

‘Kaal Chakra’ is still on its long journey and seeks the
goodwill and blessings of the esteemed drama lovers in

fulﬁlling its cherished mission.
