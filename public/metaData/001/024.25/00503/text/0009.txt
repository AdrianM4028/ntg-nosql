TUGHLAQ true to Character

Girish Karnad’s Kannada play ‘TUGHLAQ’ is in many ways the most signiﬁcant piece
of dramatic writing in this country in two decades. It has been translated into many
languages and staged at many places, In Delhi alone at least three versions in Urdu and
one in Kannada have been seen. It was gratifying, therefore, to see it staged in Bengali

by KAAL CHAKRA on Sunday night at the Fine Arts Theatre.
The Director Ajoy Chatterjee who plays the main role is able to bring out the duality
of Tughlaq’s ideas and personality. He creates a character in which the Visionary and the
eccentric are constantly present and visible. It is a well conceived piece of characterization
and the presentation at times is moving. The setting by Ajit Dutta and Mani Shahani is
functional and neat. Asit Kumar Mitra’s lighting is _effective. On the whole it is very
creditable for an Amateur group to present such a difﬁcult play with such seriousness and
devotion.
