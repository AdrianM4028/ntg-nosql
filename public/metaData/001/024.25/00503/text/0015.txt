“Ramleela” is a

theatrical form which re—captures the

valient adventures of Ram. King of Ayodhya, as has been
handed down to us by our scriptures and secondary sources.
To the deeply religious sentiments of our people ‘Ramleela’
holds immense importance, for its hero Ram signiﬁes strength
valour, vigour and purity.
This play, however, diverges from the main theme and port-

rays what goes on in the lives of those whose who perform the
‘LEELA’.

Those that spread the glories of Ram, are they the

ones who starve and perish?

ls this the relevance of Ram-

leela to our socio-cconomic conditions?

The constant tendency of our audiences to get drawn towards
meaningless myths and

vulgarities is noticeable.

Let us

endeavour to realise what is their actual requirement and
ire-examine as to what should be the content of theatre today.
