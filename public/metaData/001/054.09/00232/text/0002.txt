551 loved life and for its beauty I went out to ﬁght. I loved
you, people, and was happy when you returned my love.
I suffered when you misunderstood me. You whomever I
wronged, forgive me; you whom I cheered, forget. May
sadness never belong to my name. This is my last will for
you, father and mother, sisters, for you, my Gusta, for
you, comrades, for all those whom I loved. If you think
tears can clear away the sad dust of grief, weep for a
while. But do not regret. I lived for joy; I am dying for joy
and it would be an injustice to place upon my grave an
angel of sorrow.............. . .

In these hours today millions of people are fighting the
last battle for the freedom of men, and thousands die in the
struggle. I am one of them. And to be one of them is
beautiful, one of the soldiers of the last battle. . ..... . .... .... . .99
