In quest for an elixir for rejuvination the scientists of the National Biological Institute formulate an extract and the scientist Dr. Sambhunath Sen Gupta ﬁnally decides to
test the effects of this extract on himself, but not before young Tutul’s playful inquisitiveness has changed the extract into the new “Solution-X”. Dr. Sen Gupta demonstrates all
effects of rejuvination. Later, Mrs. Sen Gupta, Mrs. Chatterjee and others also take the
“Solution-X" unknowingly. They are also rejuvinated and they all start a kind of a jam
session. The greatest surprise came when Dr. Sen Gupta was found as a baby boy! Was
he really? Watch the fun!!
