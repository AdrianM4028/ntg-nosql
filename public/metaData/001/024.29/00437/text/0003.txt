About Ourselves
During the summer this year Vivadi, a group of actors, directors, writers, painters. musicians, came together for a six—week
theatre workshop at the Kasauli Art Centre and produced two
plays, Ghar aur Bahar and Nayika Bhed. We bring you the first of
these plays tonight.
Vivadi is interested in exploring the ways in which codes of
femininity. sexuality, morality have been constructed , how women
have handled these codes and how in art practice, for example,
they may be dislodged.
It is in this context that we would like you to see Ghar aur
Bahar, our adaptation of Rabindranath 'I‘agore’s celebrated novel
Ghare Baire. Set in Bengal at the time of the Swadeshi movement
the novel focuses on the contradictions of three characters,
Bimala, Nikhil and Sandip, caught in the storm of political change
and compelled to face the breakdown of the home, of the private
domain. The inner and outer worlds of the characters fuse, collide
and shift past one another to form complex patterns.
The original novel’s concern with the three characters’ voices as
these are interposed in the narrative is explored in this adaptation

through the use of soliloquy. monologue, ‘aside’. and the sub—
merged speech of the diary.
Bimala is played here by two actresses who share the same
uncertainties and the need to find a composite voice that can con—

front the political inspiration as well as the rhetoric of the times.
The struggle to ﬁnd such a voice, and the forms which embody
it, is our struggle as well in the theatre today.
