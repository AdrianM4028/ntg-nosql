Rabindranath Tagore's-Wgs several debates centre ~stage:
debates about the meaning of nation. nationalism and national identity.
We have attempted (:1 dramatization of the novel so that these ideas are

enacted.
While the audience knows that Gora is a white man, Gora himself
struggles with the question 'who am I' but this is always asked in tandem
with the question 'what makes a nation'. Sara and his friend Binay
debate, fight, and even get estranged because Binay moves away from
being a Hindu. Sucharita, ० Brahma, moves away from the Samaj but
further complicates issues by questioning religion. This production
attempts a strategic repositioning of the characters of Binay and
Sucharita in order that their struggle towards liberal humanism is
presented. Gora is torn between orthodox Hinduism, Western education
and the color of his skin. His whiteness has metaphoric implications
suggesting both the presence of the white colonialist and incorporation
of this alien presence into the social body of India. Whether Gora will
make (:1 journey similar to that of Binay's is left unresolved in this
production. indeed how we construct the meaning of the word citizen
in today's India is still a vexed question.
This dramatization attempts to use scenic and choric devices that

put realism in quotes to foreground narrative and direct speech as ०
way of arguing contemporary political issues on stage.
