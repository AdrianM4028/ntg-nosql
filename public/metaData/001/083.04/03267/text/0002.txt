Background
Performing arts and expressive modes of social communication took a new shape
during the political and military turmoil of the eighteenth Century Maharashtra.
Establishment and expansion of Maratha power brought patronage to the folk
artists. Pblk rituals, songs of worship, acts of jesters and clowns, acrobats and
tumblers, poetry and dance; almost everything that could entertain, was woven
into one theatrical form : Tamasha.

In the following two hundred years Tamasha evolved into Marathi Folk Theatre
of immense potential. Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Dr. Ambedkar, the great
reformers, used Tamasha as vehicle of their socio-political reformist message.
Humour and eroticism from Tamasha continues to be exploited by film and
electronic media even today.

The Group
Kalu-Balu Tamasha troupe has been in existence for almost hundred years. It
was inherited by two brothers Shiva and Sambha, Kaulapurkars from their
father. Kalu-Balu, the twins, and third generation tamasha players have their
children in the same profession. The show goes on.
Luv and Kush alias Kalu and Balu made their debut in 1946. In the following
fifty-five years they have performed with their troupe in more than twenty two
thousand shows. Perhaps a world record. Renowned for their immaculate sense of
timing, caustic impromptu wit and humour, Kalu Balu are certainly the longest
performing comic duo in the world.

Born three minutes apart in 1931 and now in their seventies, they still do around
300 shows every year. Very generous philanthropists, they have donated large
sums of money for a school and a hospital in their village.
