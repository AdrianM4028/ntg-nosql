Where The Poor Shall Prevail

The entire thrust of Maharashtra's effort is on ensuring as far as is humanly
possible that the meek shall inherit the earth.

To this end the definition of 'sma ll farmers' has been revised to
cover those

owning dry land upto six hectares (15 acres) or whose lands are
assessed upto Rs. 15.
These farmers form the larger part of the state's farming communi
ty.

The Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Anudan Yojna, which takes care
of the destitute,
and the Senjay Gandhi Swavalamban Yojana which helps put
unemployed youth on their
feet, are other facets of this effort, The decision to establish
horticultural co-operative
estates for landless labourers is yet another.

The unique Hutatma Smarak Scheme inaugurated
in Bombay on August 9 to
herald the erection of 204 monuments to freedom marty
rs all over the State, all but a few
of whom were poor, and to give their next of kin
financial help, underscores the Government s commitment to the needy, the forgotten
and the neglected.

The vigorous implementation of the Prime
Minister's ZO-Point Programme along
with the Governments Five Year Plan, the two
of which meet at many points, completes
the story of a massive and formidable effort
that has the just society as its ultimate aim.

It is appropriate that on this auspicio
us day we pledge ourselves once
again to
do our duty by those to whose strivings
and sufferings we owe our continued exis
thncein short, to make Maharastra a State.
