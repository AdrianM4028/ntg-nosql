Deathtrap is a thriller, which

takes

your

breath away with the kind of menace

and surprise for which its author, Ira Levins, is famous.

Set in Westport, Connecticut Study of the play wright—ship Sidney Bruhl, the
play seems to focus on the loVing relation—between Bruhl and his wife Myra, worried

about

Sidney’s lack of

inspiration for a new work,

the two seem to connive to

appropriate a play idea from a handsome young student, Cliﬁord Anderson.
“Seem to"..................on those words hinge an experience that has had theatre
audiences on the edge of their seats—often screaming there.

A Smash hit all over

the United States as well as in London, the play is now here and we hope you enjoy it,
being prepared for a ghorgeously amusing and terrifying time.
