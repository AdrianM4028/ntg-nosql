The Group...
Stagedoor, the University theatre group, came into being when a few enthusiastic
young people decided in 1974 that the existing set up in the amateur English thea
trical
scene in the capital was not good enough to involve all or even most of th
e available
talent. To use a colloquial phrase, they decided to do their own ‘thing' and looked
around for someone to be at the helm of affairs. The young director, Marcus
Murch,
who had already left ShakeSpearana and branched out from Yatrik, accepted th
e challenge of forging a fresh path under stiff competition. Sure enough, many te
ething
troubles had to be faced: primarily lack of ﬁnance and encouragement.

But-praise be to nothing but their own diehard perseverance, Stagedoor made their
debut with BECKET in early 1975 and has never looked back. With an ever widening
membership, repertoire and audience, they are now eleven years old, have 29 pl
ays

with 255 performances to their credit, and have been on 14 outstation tours, performing
to schools, colleges, cutural institutions and theg eneral public in Bombay, Lucknow,
.
Jaipur, Allahabad, Chandigarh, Nanital, Ajmer, Dehradun, Mussourie, Hyderabad,
Cochin and Bangalore. The group is proud of the fact that Stagedoor has been inst'vi-

mental in popularising educational English Theatre in academic institutions all ov गृ 1h ,

In September 1984, the group suﬁered tremendous set-back with the sudden death of
its Director, Marcus Murch. it took nearly eight months for us to find our feet
again. But now we are back in circulation with a bang. Our plans for the Delhi theatre
season are varied and comprehensive. They include English plays by Stagedoor and

tours by performing groups from Bombay, England and America.
