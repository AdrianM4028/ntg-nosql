founders of Yatrik, she received

make a play which engaged and
was relevant to those who

intensive professional theatre

considered themselves
uneducated, those whose daily

language is not the language of
the university or the theatre. In
short, I wanted to write a play
which would attract and was as
valid for the Ritas in the
audience as well as the Franks
and the Trishs. I think (l
certainly hope) that the play
achieves this aim. I love stories.
। spend all my writing life trying
to make stories. The story, the
narrative, which is

unfashionable in the study of
English literature, is to me all-

irnportant. A story, like a song,

can transcend barriers of
language, class and race.
Amongst those who pass
judgement on writing there is an
awful belief that something
which is easily understood and
communicated is somehow

inferior to that which requires
profound analysis and hope you
will not think me lowbrow,

unsound or inferior when | tell
you that when making
{ducal/77g R/ta I tried very hard
to write a love story. I hope I
