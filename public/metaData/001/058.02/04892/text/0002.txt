Chitrapata is a reconstruction of
Ramayana in the folk tradition.
Shoorpanakha, Ravana’s sister
comes to Ayodhya to take
revenge on Rama in the disguise
of Koravanj i . She makes Sita to
draw a portrait of Ravana and
gives life to the portrait and
disappears. Rama seeing the
portrait doubts Sita’s chastity and
tries to destroy Ravana’s image,
Sita asks Ravana to take birth as
her son, as the portrait is her
creation and tearing Ravana’s
portrait, she destroys the image.
In the folk tradition the story
depicts the inner conflict of the
human mind and the complexities
of human relations. Sita and
Shoorpanakha represent the two
facets of the womanhood. The
conflict between the two
heightens the dramatic element in
the play. The epic is made
relevant to the present day, as the
whole play is an outcome of a
modern consciousness.
