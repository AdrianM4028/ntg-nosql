Kashmama (Hindi)
Written & Directed by Usha Ganguli, Rangkarrnee, Kolkata
The Play

The city of Varanasi has its own
typical life. It keeps flowing
along the Ganges in the same
motion. Utilizing these as a
barometer, the playwright has
tried to expose the reality
behind the momentous socioeconomic changes that have
taken place in the last decade.
The story mirrors the entire
nation where politicians have

transformed religion into savage
fanaticism and culture has

taken a back seat.

Director’s Note
Kash/‘nama/ How and why did it
happen? It wasn’t totally by
accident. Our Rangkarrnee
Repertory regularly reads new
stories and plays together. In
this process we came across

the story, Panda Kat/n Kumaf/

simplicity, its slyness, as well
as its carelessness. I could see

a whole nation on the ghats in
all its diversity.

Today, everything is up for
sale — honesty, values, morality,
truth, heroism, anything man
can lay his hand upon. How are
we going to save ourselves from
this onslaught? Where is this

answers to these questions,
created a new form for this

play. The culture of Varanasi
cannot be depicted without
songs, so songs were created.
Live music was used. And a
fresh team of fifty energetic
boys and girls spent months
and months of rehearsals to
bring perfection to the
choreography. After eight
months of hard work and
excitement, the play Kashmama
was finally born.
The central character of the
play becomes the symbol of the
country on the one hand and
