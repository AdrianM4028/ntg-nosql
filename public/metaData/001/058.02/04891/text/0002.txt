The Scenes
Death of a Sa/esmah is one of
the most powerful dramas of the
20th century. It concerns an
ageing salesman, his wife and his
two sons. He is in the middle of a
family crisis. His eldest son has
become a wastrel and his younger

son is developing into a smooth—
talking conman. His wife is in
despair because the salesman is
attempting suicide.
The two scenes from Death

of a Sa/esmah that will be
enacted in Delhi concerns the
salesman begging his young boss
to retain him in the company. The

second scene is the salesman
asking his friend for a loan to pay
his insurance. The play is a

powerful indictment of the h i reand-fire business life of America.
Alyque Padamsee has
performed in this play since the
Sixties. He toured all India with it
and received much acclaim for
his performance in the central
role.
