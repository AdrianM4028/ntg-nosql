This is the first time that the Paschimbanga Natya Akaderni
collaborates with the Sangeet Natak Akademi to hold the annual
East Zone Theatre Festival, organized as part of the Sangeet Natak
Akademi’s Scheme of Assistance to Young Theatre Workers. This is
the second time it is being held in Calcutta, and the participants this
year represent the states of Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Orissa and West

Bengal. Launched seven years ago, ’the broad objective of the
scheme is to support the endeavours of young theatre directors
engaged in the production of new or existing works which promise
to enhance the frontiers of theatre, both in terms of production
values and thematic content. The scheme supports experimental
effort in any aspect of theatre: playwriting, presentation, acting etc.’
The Paschimbanga Natya Akademi has its own scheme, entering its
third year, of assisting young theatre worker's, through a series of
workshops held in major district towns, with almost all the major
theatre practitioners of the state serving on the faculties for the
training sessions, and the participants being guided through the
entire operation of a theatre production.

Hopefully, this festival will be the beginning of more creative
interaction between the two Akademis.
