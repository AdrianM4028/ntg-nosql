Synopsis
Saha Kisku and his brother Coch are Santals, cultivating the land of

Banarnali Ghosh as sharecroppers. Taking advantage of Saha’s
reluctance to record his right, Banarnali tries to evict him. Saha is in
love with Raatni, who belongs to a different tribal community, and
therefore they cannot marry each other. Goch’s wife gives birth to a
child who becomes a great favourite of Saha’s. At the child’s sudden
death, a shocked Saha gets drunk and has a drunken fight with
Jiban, Banamali’s son. Nayan, the village witch-doctor, casts his
spell on Daali, Coch's wife, who declares Saha a daain, a man

possessed by evil spirits, and responsible for her child's death.
Sahadev, a friend gives Saha shelter in his house, far away from the
tribal village. Kanu, another friend, pleads for Saha at a meeting of
the village panchayat, but the gathering is not convinced. Saha
himself starts believing in his own connexion with evil. Simon, yet
another witch-doctor, has a session with Daali, who again points to
Saha. Raatni pleads with Saha to leave the village. He resists the
idea. In a stormy night, Saha jumps into the river and swims across
to his house, where Goch, his brother, kills him with a sickle.
