Production Note
Combines realistic theatre and the traditional form of the kirtan, with

some of the aCtors playing characters and others changing identities
again and again. It projects a situation where man no longer
believes in God, and treats divinity like an antique, a showpiece,
and sometimes even like a commodity. God himself is disturbed to
the point where he would try to run away from this human prison.
But for Him there is no escape.
The Director
With a Diploma in Acting from the Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya,
Bhubaneswar, Manoj Pattanayak has directed about eighty plays in
a career of eighteen years. With several direction awards in theatre,

he has acted in ten feature films, 22 teleplays, two telefilms, and 40
radio plays. He has written eight playscripts, and is at present a
director in the commercial jatra, and also a staff artiste in the Song
and Drama Division, Government of India.
