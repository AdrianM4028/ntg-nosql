Synopsis
The fifteen characters in the play are divided into two groups. [There
is the group with the King, his son and daughter and his four
good~for~nothing ministers. The other group consists of the Bain,
the two Bhawarias, and their companions. It is through the yoUng
man, modelled on the Sutradhar of the traditional Ankiya Nat, and

standing apart from both the groups, that the playwright tries to
' project the problems of a society that is burlesqued throughout the
play.
The play opens with the two Bhawarias singing a song in praise of

the king, who enters with his band of ministers who introduce
themselves to the audience.
The king would like to know where the centre of the earth lies, and
asks his Mahamantri to locate it, warning him that his failure will
bring him dismissal from service. However the real problem lies
elsewhere; it is the grey hair of the young princess that threatens
danger to the country. She announces her sorrow which she
discovers at her dressing table as she prepares to go out to meet the
prince of Brahmapur. The minister-in-charge has made necessary
arrangements for her proposed journey, including the spraying of
perfumes and vermilion along the road. There is an oblique hint of
satire on people spending lavishly from the government exchequer
for the comfort of a V.l.P.
