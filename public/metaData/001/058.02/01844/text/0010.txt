After the Sutradhar, who represents Time and is a friend of the hero,
has introduced the play, Krishna falls sick before a crowded temple
from the adulterated prasad. The Sutradhar gives him a few tablets,

and he recovers. The politician and the Seth come to the temple
_ and take part in a meeting that plans further development of the
temple complex and the construction of a dhararnsala. Dolly, a
poor girl, prays to God, pleading for a job for Saroj, her friend. Saroj
approaches the Seth for a job. Dolly is raped by the Seth. Sam] is
determined to take revenge, and does ultimately kill the Seth in the

temple itself. Krishna leaves the place. The police investigate the
murder and the plan of the pandas to mix a powder supplied by the ,
Seth in the rnahaprasad to make it more savoury. The pandas are
arrested.
The pandas, released on bail, join in the search for Krishna. The

sankirtana group joins in the search. Krishna meanwhile goes from
house to house asking for a job, is refused everywhere, till he meets
Radha. As the pandas wander looking for Krishna, they hear
Krishna’s ﬂute, and come to the scene to find people throwing
money at the fluteplayer’s feet. Hungry and tired, Krishna falls

senseless at a point. As the Sutradhar goes looking for a doctor, the
pandas drag the unconscious Krishna intotheternple and lock it up.
As the sankirtana singers break into their song, the Sutradhar returns
and speaks the last words.
