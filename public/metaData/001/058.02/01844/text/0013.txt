Synopsis
The play opens in the house of Tabung Shaphaba, a master of the
martial arts. Khayang, a tribal prince, is training with the master. As
the news leaks out, Leima lnung Chaibi, the upper caste Queen of
the kingdom, issues an order debarring him from further training;
Tollornkhornba, the noble entrusted with the serving of the Queen’s '
order, comes upon Khongjomnubi, returning home with a pitcher
of water; scared by his horse, she drops the pitcher and breaks it. At
home she is beaten up by her cruel stepmother who sends her out
to collect ﬁrewood in the forest, where Tollornkhornba tries to
abduct her. Khayang, returning from his master’s place, rescues the
girl and marries her. The Queen, instigated by Tollomkhornba,
separates them, declaring their marriage invalid, since Khongjomnubi belonged to the Moirang caste and Khayang to the Chothe
tribe. .
Khongjomnubi runs away with her child, Pidonnu, but as the

community where she ﬁnds shelter, threatens to kill the illegitimate
child, the mother dies of shock, leaving the child behind to be

brought up by Nongleipanba, a friend of Khayang’s.

A grown-up Pidonnu comes to hunt in the jungle where she meets
the young King Chingkhai, son of the Queen lnung Chaibi. They fall
in love with each other. Khayang, now King of the Chothe tribe,
comes to see Nongleipanba and learns of the circumstances of his
beloVed’s death, and swears to take revenge on the Queen lnung
Chaibi .
