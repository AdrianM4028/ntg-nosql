law can prevent it. The crisis is too deep-rooted in the tribal heritage
and religion to be abolished. It is a part of their psyche. It is not just a
’superstition', but more like ’faith in God’, and the advances of
science alone cannot put an end to this practice.

This play traces the cause and effect of this intense, illogical faith in
the existence of the witches, prevalent in a remote village called
Harina in the district of West Dinajpur of West Bengal. The tribals’
faith in the existence of witches is as strong as their faith in their
landlords. A healthy young man named Saha Kisku is accused of
being a witch and finally is killed.
The play neither attempts a simplistic analysis nor offers an easy
solution. It seeks to show that what is generally laughed at as mere
’superstitions’ is in reality a question of deep-rooted faith, something
too dear to one’s being. A faith not enforced from outside, but born
within, through generations. A faith that prompts a brother to be
fanatic enough not to hesitate to murder his dear brother.

The playwright is convinced that this tragedy does not stem from
mere exploitation and the villainy of the landlords, but from the
tribals’ own faith and belief. Where the exploited exploits his own
kind, destroys his own kind and cannot see the light, the

playwright’s intention is to convey the shock of it all and reveal the
truth . .

To me, this play poses a very ’real’ problem in a ’real' world. it is
neither a fantasy nor symbolic or stylistically absurd. I, therefore,
have decided to produce it as a play with all the demands of a
realistic theatre. The sets, lighting, costumes, music and the
language spoken are all essentially geared to project a realistic tribal
environment.

In a setting where the mainstream productions are musicals or

stylized experiments, the present play on the tribals, with its realistic
approach, may provide an altogether different experience. The very
concept of the play is novel, an in-depth study of tribal life.
