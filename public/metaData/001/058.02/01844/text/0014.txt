life
Chothe King, beheads Pidonnu, unaware of the fact that she is in
fact his daughter. it is a shock for him when he gathers the truth from
his old friend, Nongleipan. The Chothe tribals and the people of the
valley realize the horror of intolerance over caste differences, and to
atone for their sins, they take it upon themselves to bring up

Pidonnu’s child with all love and care from both the communities.
Production Note
Dedicated to the cause of the unity of the nation, the play is a
critique of the divisions and tensions created by considerations of
caste and creed. The tragedy of the young girl Pidonnu is a vivid
example of sufferings caused by caste distinctions and the untouchability factor.
