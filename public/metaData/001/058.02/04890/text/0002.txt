I. Evam lndrajit
The last scene from Evam

translated by Pratibha Agarwal.

the modern Indian theatre. It
deals with the search for the
meaning of life. Man becomes
aware of the futility of the
ordinary motions of life —
education, work, marriage,
family. He finds life meaningless

and thinks about ending it.
Then the realization dawns that
the purpose of life is living

reached.

The scene being presented
is the last scene of the play
when lndrajit, the protogonist,

the Hindi translation of the play

The last show was held in SNA
Awards Festival in Delhi in
1973 when Shyamanand Jalan
was conferred the Akadern i
