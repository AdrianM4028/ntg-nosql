Kaatha (Oriya)
Written & Directed by Subodh Pattanaik
Natya Chetna, Bhubaneswar

The Play
Produced in 1992 Kaat/ra has
been based on a couple of real
case-studies collected from
different victims in Orissa.
Kaatha simply means wood.
But people use the word in the
sense of being stunned. In a
slum at midnight, a tribal
woman (Gurei of the play) was
crying, remembering her past
when she left her village with
her husband to live happily
without any loan. The sale of
the wood collected from the
forest was not sufficient to pay
back the loan and so the couple
came to the city to better their

life. One night as she did not
have fuel to cook she realized
once she was the supplier of the
wood now she had none.
The story highlights how the
villagers and tribals move in the
hope of a better life to the city
and they face different
hardships. The city people want
to shift to metros and the metro

indigenous life based on local
resources.

Director’s Note

Indian identity, I have tried to
avoid a few British conventions.
