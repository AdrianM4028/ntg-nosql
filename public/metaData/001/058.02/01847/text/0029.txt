the head of Vasuki, the Danavas the tail. The Danavas

protest and insist on holding the head. The Devas
calmly agree; but when the churning begins Vasuki,
strained by the pulling, vomits poison, thus killing some
of the Danavas.
Scene VIII

During the churning there emerges from the milky
ocean, Halahalarn, a poison, a hundred times more
potent than the fire in the eye of Lord Siva. Fearing the
destruction of the entire universe, the Devas and

Danavas pray to Lord Siva, who appears and swallows
the poison in order to save the world.
Scene [X

As the churning continues there emerge many wonders
which are distributed to the Devas and the Danavas:
Surabhi or Kamadhenu (the celestial cow which
yields nectar, is given to the Devarishis;

Utchisravarn (the horse), though desired by Bali, is
given to Indra on the advice of Lord Easwara;
Iravatharn (a white elephant) and
Kalpa Vriksha (the desire—gratifying tree) are given to
Indra;

Amsa of Chandra (a part of the moon) occupies his
place in the universe on the advice of Lord Brahma.
The Apsaras (dancing girls) are given to the Devas;
Lakshmi is received by Lord Vishnu as his consort;
Finally Dhanvanthari emerges holding the Amritha
Kalasa full of nectar. Lord Vishnu, foreseeing a violent
struggle for possession of the Amritham, appears in
the guise of Mohini, a beautiful woman. At the sight
of her the Danavas forget themselves. While they are
thus distracted the Amritham is distributed to the
Devas who consume Amritham. When the Danavas
realise the trick and they attempt to do violence to
Mohini, she disappears. In her place Lord Vishnu
appears and shows his Viswarupa. The Danavas ﬂee
in terror.

The drama ends with a glorious victory for the Devas,
protectors of Dharma over the unrighteous Danavas.
