Pootana-Haranam
by King Vijaya Raghava Nayaka of Tanjore
Choreography & Direction: SWAPNASUNDARI,
Kuchipudi Dance Centre, Delhi
Synopsis
This Yakshaganam begins with an invocation to Lord

Krishna. The Sutradhara introduces the theme of the
play. Yashoda brings Baby Krishna, and after feeding
him and dressing him, hands him over to a group of
Gopikas, instructing them to play with him and make
him go to sleep. As the child is put in his cradle, the
dernoness Poothana, in a charming disguise, comes
there. She claims to be a nursemaid and tricks the
Gopikas into allowing her near the cradle. With her
sorcery, she casts a spell on the Gopikas, sending them
into a trance. Poothana tries to feed her poisonous milk
to the Baby Krishna who, with his divine power, sucks
the life out of her. When Poothana falls to the ground, a
perturbed Yashoda chides the Gopikas for their
negligence and later forgives them, seeing that
Poothana could not harm her child. There are joyous
celebrations of child Krishna’s miraculous deed.
