Synopsis
Scene I

Poorva Rangarn —— Ishtadevata Prarthana, Nandi Stuthi,
inviting Rangadhistava Devatas.
Scene II

The Devas (the Gods), defeated in war by the Danavas
(the Demons), go in a deputation headed by Indra to

present their grievances to Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu
advises them to seek the cooperation of the Danavas in
obtaining Amritha (nectar) by churning Ksheerasagara
(the Ocean of Milk), using Mandara Giri (Biggest
Mountain), as a churn and Vasuki (a huge five—headed
serpent) as a rope.
Bali, Emperor of the Danavas, having established his
supremacy over the Devas, reigns with Amaravathi as
his capital. During a dance performance in his palace,
the Devas headed by Indra approach him and assure
him of their desire for peaceful and friendly relations
between the Devas and Danavas. They explain the
project for obtaining Amritha and promise an equal
share to them if they cooperate in the venture. Though
Sukra, the Teacher of Danavas (Danavas’ Guru),
expresses his disapproval, Bali ignores his advice and
promises full cooperation. His real motive in agreeing,
however, is his ambition to become ruler of the entire
universe.

Scene IV
The Devas and Danavas uproot Mandara Giri and
transport it to the milky ocean.
Scene V
The Devas and Danavas go to Naga Loka (the land of
snakes) and pray for the help of Vasuki. Vasuki agrees
to help them.

Scene VI
Mandara Gin', with Vasuki rolled around it, is installed in
the Ocean of Milk. However, the mountain sinks and is
submerged. At last, in response to the prayers of Devas

and Danavas, Lord Vishnu appears in the form of the
tortoise, which supports the mountain on its back.
