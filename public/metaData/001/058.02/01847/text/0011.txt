VENKA'I'ESWARA SARMA, Sri Bala 'I‘ripura Sundari
Kuchipudi Natya Kalakshetram, Hyderabad
Synopsis

The dance—drama depicts the story of Nartanashala from
the Mahabharata starting from the episode where the
five Pandavas and Draupadi enter the service of King
Virata under fake identities during their one year of
hiding in anonymity. (After spending 12 years in the
forest, the Pandavas had to spend another year in
Agyata, anonymous exile, for which they chose Virata’s
kingdom.) Keechaka is the brother-in—law of king Virata
and a powerful warrior who is the mainstay in the
king’s defence of the country from invaders; his word is
law. Keecheka desires the beautiful Draupadi in the
palace of the Queen Sudheshna. Keechaka’s sister
sends Draupadi to Keechaka thinking she would be
defenceless. But Draupadi lures him into the lonely
Nartanashala at night and gets him killed by Bheema
who is disguised as a woman.
