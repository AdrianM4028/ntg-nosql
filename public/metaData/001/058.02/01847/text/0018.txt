message, Karnsan resorts to get rid of Krishna by
sending demons like Poothaki, Chakadasuran,

Vrishabhasuran to Gokulam to be only defeated and
killed by Krishna and his cousin Balararna.
Repeatedly failing in his attempts to kill Krishna,
Karnsan sends an invitation to Krishna and Balarama
through his minister, Akroora, to participate in the
Dhanur Yagna (archery contest) in Mathura, an
intentional plot to trap and kill Krishna and Balarama.
Krishna, on his way to Mathura in the company of his
cousin and Akroora, overcomes a few more traps set by
Karnsan and reaches the court of Karnsan.
While Karnsan attempts to strangle Krishna, the latter,
an incarnation of Vishnu, throws Himself on Kamsan’s

lap and not only kills Karnsan but also frees Ukrasena.
Kamsan’s father, from imprisonment and enthrones him
as the king of Mathura.
Thus Krishna destroys the evil and brings peace to
the subjects.
