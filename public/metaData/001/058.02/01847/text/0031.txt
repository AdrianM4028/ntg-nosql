Rukmini Kalyanam
Direction: VEMPATI CHINNA SA'I'YAM, Kuchipudi Art

Academy, Madras
Synopsis
Scene I

Rukmini is introduced in the traditional manner of
Kuchipudi. Her queenly steps are seen behind a veil
(Yavanika) as it is brone by two maids half-way across
the stage. Peacock feathers in vases remind her of
Krishna whom she adores. The thought of him
transports her to a state of yearning for him. She ‘hears’
his inimitable ﬂute and dances in ecstasy.
Scene 22

Krishna is led on to the stage by Gopikas who sing the
glories of his incarnations, and touch upon Rukmini’s
beauty and her devotion to him of which he has
already been told by Sage Narada.
Scene [II

In this scene the maids display the portraits of
Jarasandha and others. Rukmini is cold to all of them
except of course to Krishna’s to which she reacts with
alacrity. Rukmi, her eldest brother, enters to disapprove
of her infatuation for Krishna who he considers
unworthy of her hand. He insists on her marrying his
friend Sisupala whose virtues he extols. Rukmini does
not budge, to the annoyance of her brother, who
however vows to see through her marriage to Sisupala,
come what may.
Scene IV

Sisupala is seen enjoying the dance of his courtesans
when Rukmi enters to announce his sister’s obdurate
love for Krishna. Sisupala exudes confidence that he
would, come what may, win Rukmini’s hand and
accordingly makes arrangements for the wedding.
Scene V

Rukmini is a helpless witness to the elaborate
arrangements being made for her wedding with
Sisupala. She forswears food and sleep. Nevertheless,
on the advice of her maids, she composes an epistle to
Krishna in which she pours out her heart. Torn by the
doubt whether he would be able to spot her in a
crowd, she writes:
“Remember the bridal insignia?
immaculate veil,
cbeelemarle,

plaits in ‘Mogali ’petals
avid eyes
heaving bean,
