Bhamakalapam
by Siddhendra Yogi
Direction: VEDAN'Iâ€˜AM SA'I'YANARAYANA SARMA
Artists: Vedantam Satyanarayana Sarma 8: Group
Synopsis

Bharnakalaparn is the first of the Kuchipudi Kalapa
traditions and the most important item of the Kuchipudi
repertoire. It was composed by Siddhendra Yogi, the
perceptor of Kuchipudi.
This Kalapam revolves around Satyabhama, the
proud consort of Srikrishna. She narrates to Madhavi, her
Sakhi, how a playful and innocent comment of hers that
she was more beautiful than Krishna himself had
triggered a quarrel and a long separation between her
and Krishna. Satyabhama pines for union with Krishna.
The Kalapam contains the traditional Daruvus and
Vachika of Kuchipudi. It ends with Krishna coming
back to Satyabhama and her submission to him.
