Gari' as well. At that time, Buddhism, Saivism, Vedic religion and Tantra
Sadhna all these were entangled, Scenes 6 and 12 have been है

prepared in view of this fact. We felt its significant for showing gradual
expansion of Chuharrnal - a negative Character of the play and his
company of thieves. Audience would enjoy folkstyle of comedy there.
" In scene 13 two groups of three artists akin to Natyasastra's rTrigat' A
comes on the stage, and describe war-scenes through vocal as well as
acting. Unlike traditional classics, Trigat of our presentation keeps up a
running commentary on the war and does not comment on prospective
happenings. Trigat mingles to be a part of our play. In the era of

Salhesa, we find a contest of Chinese San ruler's attack on Bharata
(India) aiming to win it with the help of one lakh soldiers. In a fierce
'gada-yudha’ Salhesa kills chuhara. After this, group cf. rTrigat' sounds

funeral of Chinese forces. At last, i would like to clearify that my
intention while directing this play was neither to imitate Natya sastra and

folk conventions nor to destroy them on the excuse of experiment.
Rather, this play is a part of the fuest of Yuva Rangmanch that pursues
right way to make traditions meaningful and germane with a sense of
modernity for theatrical purposes.

We aspire to continue the process of search for new-vision of
theatre with our rich cultural heritage hence, this production is a part of

that process and not the ultimate result. We have sincerely toiled hard

to enrich the: process.
