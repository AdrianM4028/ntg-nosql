Today various established methods are followed while
presenting a play on the stage. The total planning for play depends on

such methods. But there are various other elements available outside
these methods which can be picked up from our day-to-day life and

used in the planning and presentation of a play. This possibility has
encouraged us to go ahead using such day-to-day life elements in this
play-Urukha.
Keeping this kind of possibilities in mind and specially

being a student of acting myself, I am trying to present this play with
such experiments.

The play that I've chosen i.e. URUKHA has the subjects
as art, artist and struggle. There are numerous occasions in the play in
which scope for use of the possibilities for my experiment exists. The
heroine being a dancer, Ghoongroo is prominently in use in the play.

The sound of ghoongroo can affect the dancer in various ways at

different times. It can provide her with determination, it can create
sensuality in her mind and can remind at times about her past, her
sorrow or happiness. Similarly for the frustrated artist-the hero, the word
‘Ma’ can fill his mind with hate. Likewise voice of the paperwala drifting in

from outside gives a feeling of revenge to the poet in him.

Taking this kind of relationships between the characters
in the play and various words, we are trying to present this play with a
different touch. In addition we are trying to reflect certain mental states

of the characters through the use of elements like puppet, dance,
colour, painting, mask, unity of gesture, costume, improvised folk tune

etc. At times to show the different dirnentions of a single character,
multiple characters are being created and use.
