Pranjal, the hero of the play is engrossed in painting.

+

The characters of the painting make alive the stage-illustration.
The mood of the painting is expressed through the physical &
facial expression of Pranjal. Banashree, the heroine of the play
tries her level best to cairn him down with the sounds of

‘NUPOOR’ - being angry and at last with adoration.
Relationship between Pranjal & Banashree.
With his confidence & dedication Pranjal wipes out the doubts

Banashree so far had regarding the existance of painting &
poetry. The sounds of a PAPERWALA make Pranjal unrest.

The ecstatic feeling of the economically poor artist couple as if

dancing RADHA-KRISHNA.
Some unnatural tune disturbs Banashree in her sleep. Pranjal is
so annoyed with the behaviour of some of the people of the

society — he brings out the hidden PISTOL.

Visualisation of five Antagonists.
Pranjal & Banashree's different relationships with the paintings
8: their home.

Shankar, the nearest friend of the artists couple stands near by
the window. Pranjal hides himself out.

Pranjal again becomes uneasy thinking about the antagonists
for whom he has to live an isolated life being away from the
society. He can’t face Banashree for her practical Iogics.
