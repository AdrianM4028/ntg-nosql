Shankar comes again. He talks with a different Pranjal.

+

Banashree is shocked as the vermilion (redlead) falls down from
her hand. She is so afraid, as if a storm comes to tear up the sky
of her vision. Pranjal is exited in search of KALIDASA while

practical Banashree becomes helpless in search of security.
Here the conflicts arise between them.
+

Each of them tries to understand & make understand each

other. As Pranjal expresses his inability to look after Banashree,
he shows here the path to be independent.
+

Banashree, the dancer is not happy at all as she couldn't fulfil

whatever she has opted in her life. Hence she decides to leave

Pranjal. Pranjal becomes helpless. The questions of the social
identity, creation, art, artist etc. arise.
+

दृ At last Prasanta oornes to take away Banashree. He also brings
the news of Pranjal’s success. But by the time Pranjal is not in a
position to understand the meaning of identity or social
recognisation.

+

Banashree is disillusioned. Now she decided to pass her

remaining life in dancing.
