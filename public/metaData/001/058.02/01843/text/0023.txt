“RUDHA DWAR” deals with the present day's war mongering
politicians, who always loot at their own interest; and to save their own
complex and ego, they will never hesitate to destroy the human
society.

They always lead the people to war and destruction to hide their
weakness and helplessness. The befiting theme and the story by Rati

Ranjan Mishra attracted me to handle this play in a improvisation theatre
form, using folk and traditional music and dance forms of Orissa.
