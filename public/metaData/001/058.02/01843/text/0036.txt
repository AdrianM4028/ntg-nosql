of the sheer desire to be free again and come to see Maya. Just to see
her face again.

Rudra brings with him a bottle of Rum and a whirlpool of violent
questions that have no easy answers. The repositioning of socialist
stance in East Europe, Russia today reduces him to a puerile activist, a

common criminal. Even facts prove that he is not even a political
murderer. His complete loss of faith questions the very basis of Ashim's
book. Ashim's attempt is reduced to fulility, of no consequence.
Ashim realises that he had been living in his own isolated world
of socialist morals that donâ€˜t have any value today. Realises that he has
been living and growing like his own cactus plants, devoid of rain, water,
sunshine, devoid of the outer world.

It is he who now is prepared to drink the poison which Maya
keeps hidden in her cupboard.
But the tables have turned. I Maya is inspired by Rudra's
overpowering love, his undefeatable desire to live and see her face
again. She decides to live and face life. She bars Ashim from killing
himself. She decides to go to a sanitoriurn, and undergo treatment and
get better.

Rudra comes like a storm disorienting and stripping off the
couple completely. He leaves as a total neurotic. But having been
completely stripped off, the couple are cleaned, they reunite.

Maya wakes up in the dead of night to request Ashim to sing an
old favourite. Sitting in their dark bedroom, with their squeaky, dirty
harmonium, Ashim sings.

Hai Malik Tere Bande Hum

Aise Ho Harnare Karam
Sach rah par Chale
Aur Bali par chade
Take Haste Huye Nikle dum .... ..
