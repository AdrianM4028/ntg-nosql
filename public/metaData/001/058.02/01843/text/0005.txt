URUKHA is a poetry by itself. It tries to depict a picture of the struggle
experienced by an artist. More than the physical struggle, it is rather the

psychological. or mental agony that an artist faces when conflicting
situations take form between his art and the real material world.

On one end the pulling force is the art and artistic sensibility and the
other one being the material attractions of the real world. The artist is
the subject in between who struggles between these two forces.

There are certain words which when pronounced affects the listner or

the speaker physically. These are such words which are very intimately
tied up with our lives. For instance a non-vegetarian guy when staying

against his will for a long time at a place where only vegetarian food is
available, if suddenly hears words like meat, chicken etc. , his mouth fills

with water. The desire for meat becomes automatically expressed.
Similar thing happens with the world EMELI. Can we not use these kind
of effective words aesthetically as part of acting styles?
