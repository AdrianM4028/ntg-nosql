W11: Note
Kanta Gach is a play about the present state of socialists belonging to
the 70's against the current worldwide confusion in the 90's set around

three friends who come together for a night. The play attempts at
capturing the contemporary loss of faith the lonliness, the betrayal and

its consequences, leading to a brutal confrontation that gives them
renewed energy to face life once again.
