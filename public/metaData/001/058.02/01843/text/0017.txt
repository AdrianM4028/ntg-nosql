One day the innocent people of the village "Phasalpal” hear the news
from T.V. that there will be a National Test range in that area.
The illiterate people don't know what a testrange is? So they go to the

Local School Master. He explains that it will be a defence installation;
which will experiment test firing of missiles and he adds, 'Our area
including nearby villages will be the target of enemy bombs’.

The public with the leadership of the teacher oppose this project. They
blow conch-shells, beat drums and block the roads.

The Government could not function. There is a cease within. The

Government uses force. Tries

to divide the mass. The local

rnusclernen are bribed to kill the master and his wife. The police gives a

report, “due to non-availability of witness the case is closed”. The
tortured villagers remain silent due to fear of life.
In the weakest moment, a small child, son of the teacher come forward,

lifts the banner of revolution and declare “The fight must go on to

Restore Peace”.
