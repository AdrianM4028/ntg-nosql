being held at Guwahati from 16th November to 21st November’s} 1 .
In the great theatre movement of the country, our state has also
a history of its own which speaks of our glorious past. It was Srimanta
Sankaradeva, the great Vaishnavite Saint, who had initiated the
theatre movement in Assam in the sixteenth century with his innovation

of "Ankia Bhaona”. That was a landmark in the history of Indian

Theatre. The East Zone Theatre Festival '91 organised jointly by

Sangeet Natak Akaderni, New Delhi and Directorate of the Cultural
Affairs, Assam is of immense value for the promotion of a healthy

theatre movement in this region. The festival is organised with an

object to enthuse the young theatre workers of this region engaged in
exploring and developing theatre activities inspired by the traditional
and folk elements.

We hope, the festival will pave the way for the young theatre
workers to express their talents and new creation in the theatre world.
