The Pana Lamjel was a race performed as a compulsory rite in

the Thangjing Lai Haraoba. Games and Sports were part of the ritual
activities. The person who won the race was to be chosen as the leader

of the village youths. The King imposed strict limitations while selecting
competitors. Courtiers and Nobles used to interfere in selection of

competitors. The machinations and intrigues were part of the race.
Kharnba, the hero, tried to compete in the race. He had neither

supporters nor influential members in the Court. Chaobanongthon
managed to have his candidature ampted. If he won the race, he would
get princess Thoibi as an award.
Nongban, the rival of Kharnba and Efavourite of Chingkhuba
Yubaraj, was the greatest obstacle. He was the rival 'of the race and his
supporters with arms attempted to eliminate Khamba during the race.

Kharnba won the race. But it was not a fulfilment of a young hearts’
ambition. The race had other meanings more sinister, more dangerous.
The machinations of the Courtiers, the intrigues of the rival, the
tensions the clash of ambitions were more predominant which

destroyed the hopes of the winner of the race. Kharnba became aware
of the sinister forces in operation in society beset with overwearing
desires and passions.
