Molierc and The Miser
Moliere (plauwright, director, actor), the comic master of the
modern drama, was a genius who cast an ample shade over
the entire European theatre.
He took to theatre while great tragedians invested aristrocrotic
and upper middle-class societu with jeweled robes. He stripped
it clean to the motleu underneath and which societu does not
wear motleu underneath ! But he was no reformer of the
militant stamp, although he was intellectuallu superior to most
men of his generation. He was a true son of the age. He
never roared like Johnson, he simplu laughed. His comic method
was neat and sure. His plots were lucid, events were
scrupulouslu balanced. His stule was plauful and full of humour
of the mind. He had the wisdom to remember the object of
comedu as laughter and entertainment.
In HUNJOOS, a Hindustani adaptation of Moliere's THE MISER
bu Hazrat Hwara, Mirza Sakhawat Beg, like all his major
characters in other plaus, is reduced to a single comic impulse;
an obsession for moneu which governs the entire action of his
life and the plau as well. Mirza is a ridiculous as well as great
caricature of miserliness and covetousness. The repellent miser
Mirza is finallu routed when the girl he has desired is married
to the son he has mistreated, although his grief is lightened
bu the reflection that his other child, the eloping daughter will
be married without dowru. But Mirza is not a sinister figure; he
is too easilu outwitted bu the pleasant lovers, and is
genuinelu amusing when Hlfu exposes his stealing oats form his
horses or when his constitutional aversion to the word ‘give'
compels him to pretend—"l have to check mu mail or good dau
to uou." He is the most ridiculous of all the characters and has
aetouch of pathos, a sense of lost and bewildered humanitu
which lends him universal appeal. He is never deliberatelu
malicious, though his satire cuts deep, which is directed

against those who sought to dupe or entangle the ordinaru
man.
