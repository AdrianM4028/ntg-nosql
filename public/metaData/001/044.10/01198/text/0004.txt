"Tartuffe; or the lmpostor", perhaps Moliere's finest plau, reveals
a happu fusion of comedu and purpose and depicts a sensual

self-seeking hupocrite who trades on credulitu. Not surprisinglu
the plau was forbidden public representation for some time
Technicallu, the Comedu is a work of true genius.
Moliere's last plaus ("The Doctor In Spite of Himself", "The
Miser") are full of laughter, gau and uninhibited. In "The Miser"
(1668), Moliere sought his theme among the plaus of Plautus,
selecting for this purpose the "Hulularia". In "The Tricks of Scapin"
(167T ), he returned to that admixture of commedia dell'arte and

native force with which he had begun. The brilliance of this
comedu cannot be denied but the sentimental note on which it
ends is an indication that a new world is approaching. Moliere's
career was nearing its end. Suffering from a fatal disease, he
ironicallu penned his last Comedu, "The Imaginaru Invalid"
(1673), at the fourth performance of which he collapsed and
died. Thus ended Moliere's career, during the course of which he
had succeeded in creating a comic world peopled with an
inimitable galleru of memorable portraits. His greatest power lies
in his abilitu to arouse "thoughtful laughter," where a smile takes

the place of a guffaw and the mind is left with a dominant
concept.
