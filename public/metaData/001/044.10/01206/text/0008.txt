The following is an attempt to
understand Gandhiji through his
opposite. Let us put Gandhiji and
Gandhian ideas against those of
his adversaries and see what

happens. Lets begin with the
fascist dictator Mussoloni.
Mussoloni invited Gandhi ji to
Italy. Gandhiji’s friends cautioned
him, not so much about any
irnmminent threat to Gandhiji’s
life, but about the extrordinary
slander machine that the fascist
propaganda possessed. Ga ndhiji
went sufficiently armed. He went
with witnesses and he put down
everything that was said on
record. Mussoloni showed

Gandhiji the enormous wealth he
possessed and started boasting
about his success. He thought he
was being shrewd. He wanted an
enimies enemy to become an ally.
Mussoloni : We desire that nothing

more shall be heard of
brotherhood, sisterhood,
cousinhood, or their bastard
parenthoods, because the relations

between states are relations of

force. These relations of force are
the determining elements of our

policy. . ..

Gandhiji told him politely but
bluntly that,
Gnndlu'ji you are building a house
of cards.

Gandhiji had gone to attend the
Round table Conference. Winston
Churchill reflects the mood of the
British rulers, towards Gandhiji, at
that time, more succinctly than

any one else.
Winston Churchill I It is alarming

and also nauseating to see Mr.
Gandhi, a seditious middle temple
lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a
type well known in the east,

striding half naked up the steps of
the Viceregal palace, while he is
still persuing civil disobedience to
parley on equal terms with the
representative of the king Emperor.

Gandhiji went up the steps of the
Viceregal palace with supreme
abandon and met the king
emperor exactly the way Churchill
had described him : A half naked
fa kir of the east. Later some one
asked Gandhiji about it, and he

answered thus :
Gandhiji : The king had enough on
for both of us.

Let us contrast Mr. Golwalkars
concern for ’Concept of Hindu
Rashtra, and his enthusiasm
towards German experience, as he
called the Nazi experiment and
Ga nd hiji’s concern for Hindu
Muslim unity.
Golwzzlkm' : German national pride
has now become the topic of the,
day. To keep up the purity of the
nation and its culture, Germany
shocked the world by purging the
country of the semi ticrac es-the
Jews. National pride at its highest

has been manifested here. Germany
has also shown how well-nigh
impossible it is for races and
cultures, having differences going
to the root, to be assimilated into
one united whole, a good lesson for

us in Hindustan to learn and profit
by.

Col wa 1 ka r then proceeds to spell
out the Indian implications of
what he had learnt from Nazism

with enviable clarity :
Golzmlkar : From this standpoint
sanctioned by the experience of
shrewed old nations, the
non-Hindu people in Hindustan

must either adopt the Hindu
culture and language, must learn to
respect and revere Hindu religion,

must entertain no idea but the
glorification of the Hindu nation

i.e. they must not only give up their
attitude of intolerance and
ingratitude towards this land and
its age—long traditions, but must

also cultivate the positive attitude
of love and devotion ins tead; in one

word, they must cease to be
foreigners or may stay in the
country wholly subordinated to the
Hind u nation, claiming

nothing, deserving no privileges,

far less any preferential treatment,
not even citizen’s rights.
