The West did not expect
Gandhiji’s gesture to mean
anything. They were so
completely taken aback when this
simple act of picking up salt made
forty million people rise in unison.
I would like to conclude by saying
only such gestures coupled with
accurate words can produce
meaning. It is the metaphor that
produces the meaning. It is the
staged reality that produces a new
realisation of truth. As a theatre
person I think it is my sacred duty
to produce simple and effective

gestures using words and only
words. It is the gesture that
produces meaning in words and it
is the word that prompts the
metaphor to take shape.
