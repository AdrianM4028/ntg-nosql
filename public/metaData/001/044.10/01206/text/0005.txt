But the Indian realist
unfortunately is ineffective. It is

important today to understand the
reasons for his ineffectiveness.
Because his ineffectiveness is far

more legitimate and deserves
greater understanding than the
shrewd ness of the exporter of
indianness. Like the modernist in
literature, the realist in Indian

Theatre holds on to truth as an

expression of guilt. He feels guilty

How can I play harsh ’Chande’,
for example, inside this small
auditorium prescribed by the
Natyashastra, measuring a mere
32 hastas by 32 hastas. How can I
wear huge masks and do martial
dance on this small and subtle
stage. It can only create noice
pollution and not truth. Why did
we not emphasise the primacy of
words as the most crucial aspect of
our Theatre tradition ? Did we
misunderstand Kalidasa so much ?

After half a decade truth has once

again taken the Centre stage;
though it looks as if a big lie has
taken centre stage. The collapse of
socialism and destruction of Babri
Masjid both shook us badly.
Precisely for this reason I want to
be once again a proud Indian and

better than them. For example I
want to tell the world that it was

I think this contribution of ours is
as important, as for example, our
contribution of the concept of zero.
I have called our traditionalists,
quite contemptuously, mere

exporters of Indianness because
they have missed this crucial
point. The'Indian realist also has
missed this point. If only the
realist had understood that a

The traditionalist has not only
misunderstood Natyashastra but

The West misunderstood
Kalidasa, right from the days of

Goethe, because they only looked

for meaning in it. They are trained
mentally and morally to look for
meaning in everything. Goethe
thought Shankuntalam a great
drama of love. He was more

attracted by the power of imagery
in Kalidasa’s language. The west
for example cannot understand
the significance of a mere ring in
Shakuntalam, nor for example the
significance of a mere gossip in
Bhavabhuti’s Uttara Ram
Charitarn. True the story of
Shankuntalam is complete

without the Ring. _In fact in the
Mahabharata story there is no
ring. Similarly the gossip takes
place after Ramayana is over. The
epic is complete without this silly
gossip. But not 'Bhavabhuti’s play’
In order to understand the
metaphor in Indian drama it is
crucial to understood the
significance of these silly things.
Contrast such a thing with the
fury of gods in Oedipus Rex. The
fury of god and the finalness of
fate is Central to Western thought.
It is concrete and unchangeable. It

is a meaning and not a metaphor.
Western Theatre fought a

torturous battle for two thousand
years to arrive from this finality to
an ambiguity called I’roscenium

stage. But still they have not
arrived. Yet I like them for their
stoicity and their dogged ness.
