For Gozzi, an aristocrat and conservative whose

nostalgia for a time of courtly and classic ideals inﬂuenced his literary tastes, the commedia dell’arte was
the the consurnate model for the theatre. The be-

liefs underlying the age of Enlightenment, beliefs
Goldoni shared, were hypocritical and reprehen-

sible to Gozzi. In his view, the philosophy of the Enlightenment threatened to destroy the traditional
aris-

tocratic European values with the vulgarity of social
upheaval, scientisrn, and middle-class morality.
The
world he created afforded him an escape from
the one
around him, in which bourgeois values were
becoming

more and more generally accepted, as his family
fortune dwindled and his way of life faded
with the
decaying aristocracy.

In the tradition of the commedia dell
’arte, some of
the scenes of Gozzi’sﬂabe are left to
the improvisation

of the actors, although the action is wor

ked out in det

ail
by the dramatist. But the majority
of scenes are cornpletely written out in a dialogue
of verse and prose
studded with polernical speeches.
Thus, curiously
enough, having criticized plays of
fixed dialogue, nonimprovised drama, and moralizin
g speeches, Gozzi

indulged freely in all three technique
Chiari, and others were doing.

s, just as Goldoni,

All Gozzi’s dramatic ﬁabe are cha
racterized by
great variety and complexity: fantas
y is contrasted with
realism ; moods alternate, moving
rapidly from gaiety to
solemnity; satire is bolstered by
imaginative ﬂights;
and the standard Tuscan speech
of the nobility is
counterbalanced by the Neapol
itan, Venetian, and

Bergamask dialects of the lower-cla
ss stock characters

. Through the plays marches the
gallery of great
com

media dell’arte figures: Pantalone,
’I‘artaglia, Truffaldino, Brighella, and Smeraldina.
