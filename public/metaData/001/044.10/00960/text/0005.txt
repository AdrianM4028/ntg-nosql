scandal that ended with Gratarol’s disgrace and departure from Venice.

Gozzi continued his association with the Sacchi
troupe until the mid-17805. when things began to go
badly. Sacchi, as he grew older, became more tyrannical, and the troupe finally disbanded, Sacchi himself
leaving Venice to seek his fortune elsewhere. After the
dramatist and the actor-director bade each other fare-

well, Gozzi never again wrote for the stage. Gozzi died
in Venice on April 4, 1806.

WORK
Count Gozzi created in his ten major plays, or
ﬁabe. a distinctive world of fantasy and wonder based
upon popular and Oriental tales. Coming to the theatrical world with the advent of the age of reason and
realism, his work was a reaction against the social

forces of the Enlightenment, which were ushering in an
age and attitudes that he despised. Thus Gozzi adhered
to the traditional: his dramaticﬁabe are adaptations of
themes and plots of the, commedia dell’arte, the immediate source and inspiration of his genius.
At this time the commedia. though still highly
admired in Gozzi’s native Venice , had fallen into artistic

and popular decline. Gozzi is believed to have recognized
this. but he imputed its decline to the introduction of
bourgeois values. exemplified in his eyes by the plays of

Carlo Goldoni. He also took issue with Pietro Chiari,
who though critical of Goldoni’s naturalism, nevertheless
wrote fixed dialogues in highly polished Martellian
verses. In an attempt to denigrate Goldoni's
sentimentalization of the classic “masks” , the traditional
stock characters of the commedia who wore masks,

Gozzi penned his first play. Love for Three Oranges
(L’amore delle tre melarance, 1761), in which the
characters F‘ata Morgana and Celio the magician are
clearly satirical portraits of Goldoni and Chiari. Apart
from its intrinsic merits as drama. the play is a document
of one of the theatre’s most celebrated controversies.
