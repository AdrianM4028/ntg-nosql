An annual Fest
worth waiting for
SKP Drama Festival

Shri Ram Centre

" ‘HIS annual hosted by the
Sahitya Kala Parishad proves
one thing beyond doubt: theatre off
Mandi House, in cities beyond the
Capital, through unostentatious
amateur groups, is fresh, vibrant
and meaningful. lf last year SKP,
in collaboration with the North
Central Zonal Cultural Centre, regaled theatre buffs with gems from
Patna, Bhopal, Jaipur, the trend
continues this year too with groups
from Bhopal, Lucknow, Patna, Allahabad and a lesser known one
from Delhi displaying its professional skill before a near-packed
auditorium.

The highlights of the festival were
Kala Sangam’s Amali and Maila
Anchal, 'Darpan’s Kamala and the
Parishad’s lnsaf-urf-Dilli Darbar
which recreated the bygone splendour of the Parsi Theatre on a
modern stage. The play, based on

the rivalry between Aurangzeb and
Dara Shikoh, uses all the hallmarks
of the Parsee genre: poetic strain of
dialogues; heavily painted curtain
backdrops; ornate, gold-sequinned
costumes;
exaggerated

characterisation; a dramatic tone
bordering on melodrama. Written
almost 70 years ago by Sulaiman
Ali Asif, the play retained its
quaint old world charm even as it
brought to light power struggles
and internecine feuds that began to
raise their ugly head during Shah
Jahan’s reign. For its bid to revive
and rejuvenate a traditional theatre
form, the Parishad deserves kudos.
In a more contemporary vein,
Satish Anand has been trying to
experiment with another folk form:
Bidesiya. Anand uses this Bihari
style of expression to present current themes and tales or the
classical plays themselves. Last
year he presented Mati Ki Gadi in
a spellbinding show that was startling in its simplicity, lyricism and
mesmeric rhythm. This year
Phanishwar Nath Renu’s classic
novel, Mai/a, Anchal that _documents the decline in the political
and meal fabric of the country
after partition, was rendered in.
Bhojpuri. Once again, minus the
frills and ﬂounces of proscenium,
with music, dance, colour and vig-

our.
His second play, Amali was
equally topical in its indictment of
a socio-political set-up that makes
उम---------------------- .

it impossible for a lone woman to
survive with self-respect.
The narrative was dexterously
unfolded by the traditional
sutradhar (Nilesh), the irony
brought to light by the wide-eyed
queries of the village fool (Pravin),
and the sinister wheeling-dealing of
the village power-brokers laid bare
through the snarl and leer of the
feudal landloﬂ, Mahadev Rao
(Satish Anand). But the vulnerability of the woman seemed to get
lost in the cliched characterisation
of the protagonist, Amali. She, like
the traditional weepie, displays no
spark of rebellion or anger.
Bogged down by a similar strain
of melodrama and overacting was
Surya Sethi’s Boeing-Boeing. A
play which could have been a
breezy comedy of crazy mix-ups
and misdemeanours of a habitual
lothario trailed off into hysteria, an
overspill of physical assault, overacting and boredom. Young and

between three girl friends, Rosy,
Rukhsana and Radha.
It is here that the drama suddenly
veers off into uncontrolled hysteria
where the three ‘exploited’ damsels

choose vent their distress in a
series of blows dealt relentlesst on
the hapless Bansi to the accompaniment of high pitched
shrieks,bringing to life the cliched

visage of a woman scorned, hell’s
fury et al. Sheer amateurism that
needs a strong dose of polish.
Providing a contrast was
Darpan’s professional rendition of
Tendulkar‘s Kama/a which, by far,

was the most neatly rounded
production of the fest. The questionable merits of ‘investigative’
journalism, the firmly entrenched
male bias in society, the intrinsic
secondary status of women and the

clash of values between a cornmitted newsman of yore and activist-journalists of today: all this
comes across with exquisite finesse
through a series of tense encounters between the protagonists The sets were impeccable, the
acting controlled, the drama accen-

tuated in all the right places, the
pathos implicit and never everstated and the message came forth
in a style that was uncluttered and
understated.
All in all. a festival that is worth

waiting for every year.
