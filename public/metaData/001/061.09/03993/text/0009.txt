JAB SHAHAR HAMARA soTA HAI
जब शहर हमारा सोता है

The Play is about noble and base feelings, about hope and justice, and
so contrasts with the world we actually live in. Tragedy, passion, struggle and
violence are all dimly perceived in an as yet hazy plot.
It synthesises the almost tragic dynamism of the characters and their च
behaviour with cruel impasse of their lives.

"Jab Shahar Harnara Sofa Hat" is about a generation which dsplays
youthful directness, which is no more tolerant, no more subtle and is
emotionally charged. It brings to the stage a whole world of injustice, irate
and intolerance. And there in the rniddte of it all stands a girl with a gentle,
hesitant, slightly puzzled smile looking tenderly, searchineg into her lover's
eyes, listening intently and slightly anxiously to what they are saying.
It is all about innocence scarred by the truth life introduces it to . The
lovers benevolence, strangled by the vice grip of fanaticism.
What matters to them is the love they have sworn for one another.
What threatens them are the looming clouds of seething hatred their people
have inherited.
The pair, like pigeons, takes off in flight searching for a part of the
sky from which a ray of sunlight pierces through the overcast sky, promising
that there is a light beyond. Light of reason, light of sanity and lighth hope.

The pigeons must race. They do. Together. Forever.
It is based on "West Side Story" by Jerome D. Robins
