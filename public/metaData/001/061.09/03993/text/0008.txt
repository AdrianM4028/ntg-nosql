Virat saves his country by winning a war against enemies
in the face of insurmountable odds, for which his king
rewards him by making him commander—in—chief, But Virat
happens to have inadvertantly killed his own brother, who
had joined the enemy camp, and therefore refuses the
honour. The King then makes him the chief justice of the
country, which positionVirat gratefully accepts.
One day, however, when Virat sentences a man accused of
murder with imprisonment, the convict glarse at him in
anger and in his eyes Virat sees the same eyes, the eyes
of his dead brother, accusing him of injustice. On this Virat
renounces his post and decides that all action results in
some bad consequences for others. Hence he choses a

life' of total inaction.
One day, however, when he notices his son whip a slave,
he realises that inaction so practised also produced harmful
social ramifications, for in the eyes of the slave he again
notices his own brother's accusing eyes. He then decides
to live a life of renunciation.
One day, however, a woman makes him the offering of her
dead child, saying that as Virats fame as a saint spread
around, people began to emulate his example and his own
man, the only earning member of the family, followed suit
and left for the jungle, with the results that his children
began to die one by one, This last being her third. In her
eyes Virat again perceives his brother's accusing gaze. He
decides to approach the King and request him to allow him
to do the meanest service, for he had realised that the
lowest of the low, doing the meanest of all mean jobs
without ever questioning, truly attain spiritual salvation.

He finally. serves as a ‘Chandala’ in the Cremation ground
and himself Collapses while taking king the dead body of
the King, who is Killed by the enemies, to the cremation
ground.
