A search into the
annals of native
dramatic forms
and an. effort to
widen the possi-_

bilities

of

the

proscenium. seemed to be the hallmarks of the plays presented by the
Sahitya Kala Praishad.
Satish Anand‘s use of the
Bideshia style (of Bhikari Thakur of
the 19305) in the dramatised version
of Phanindra Nath. Renu’s novel.
Mai/a Anchal. endeared itself to the

audiences as it did last year. blending as it did organically with the
Bhojpuri dialect and the music. in
chronicling the history of a village in
the North-East of Bihar. from the
pre~independence days to the phase
after.
The political heat outside is felt in
the village through the idealistic
G‘andhian. the revolutionary socialist. the scientific approach of ‘the
doctor. and so on. Condensing "the
400 page novel of Phanindra Nath
Renu to "a; tautly strung play of 60
odd pages , this presentation by Kala

Malavikagnirtll‘itra
Kalidasa’s‘ Malav‘ikagnimitra. an
ordinary love stOry in Sanskrit cornposed for the Gupta royalty. was
lifted out of the Classical milieu and

made familiar through the Bundeli
dialect by B.V.Karanth. Thisfpro‘duction by B'l'i'arat Bha‘van‘s Rangmandal. showed an electric choice
of elements from different ~per-

‘civilised’ urban‘ intelligentsia and
the 'barbaric” practices in. tribal
societies. The play draws upon the.
true story of the purchase of Kamla.
the tribal Woman. by a . journalist.
But saved from being a commodity.
to be auctioned, she becomes just
an interesting exhibit. The use of

formative traditions. For instance.
the use of 'Ihirasheela (Curtain) in'

tribal music as a sigriature tune
whenever Kamla entered the middle

of the romance.

The director uses the persona of
the ~.S'utradhar to entertain as ‘ well as
perform the choric function. A
theatrical adoption of each move-

ment of the actor‘s body, imagina—
tive use of space and appropriate
sense of lighting sustained the
vigour and speed of the dramatic'
a'ctiorr. Amali. also directed by sat,ish Anand. which followed Mai/a

Anchal. mapped the fortunes of a
village through the battered woman .
Amali becomes the prism through
whom is perceived the slump in the
village economy. the displacement
of the local labour. a break-up in the
traditional family units and the corisequent victimisation of village
women. Amali‘s suffering .symbolIses a larger social reality of the
rural woman. of deprivation and
exploitation .1: the hands of power,

tive memory and acutely conveyed
the pain of uprodtedness which. was
perhaps several shades more humiliating than the customary auction.
Presented in a realistic model by
Darpan. Lucknow. Thapliyal effectively brought out the subversive
energy of the play. ‘ His interpretative depth was particularly evident

in the dramatisation of the press
conference. where the lewd corn—
ments of media men. reported
through the drunken voice of lai

light concentrating on the corner
where Kamala sits. quivering in'

little restraint.

The festival also presented a farcical
comedy. Boeing Boeing. based on
an English novel. Directed by Suiya
Sethi and presented by Bahubhashi
Kala Sansthan. Allahabad. the play
lagged in finesse and maturity in its
portrayal of comic situations. The’
teak moment of confusion in the
plot was spoilt by overacting.
