“UCHAKKON KA KORAS”

उचक्कों का कोरस

The play Centres around an honest but lazy villager, Achhaybar,
whose crazy actions unwittingly create tension among the
Hindus and Muslims. The unscruplous and self—seeking
leaders of both the communities use a makebelieve situation
about Achhaybar’s death to cause frenzied confrontation.
When Achhaybar himself appears in order to prevent the
bloodshed, instead of relief they feel cheated and beat him up
mercilessly. The play seeks the opinion of the spectators

whether Achhaybar was quilty of cheating or not.
A part from the obvious satire on politicians and the plight of
the unemployed, the play comments on our tendency to see
only what we wish to see.
