the single pilgrim. . .
If man could see
that he elbows

Each day he walks a mile,
which catch at him,

Which fall behind and graze him
as he passes,
Then would he know that
life’s a single pilgrim
Fighting unarmed among
a thousand soldiers
Tonight he will sleep serene
He won through this fortunate day

Ebr his armour somehow
withstood the day’s assaults
But tomorrow he may be under
siege again
Who, then, will give him the
armour that shields
Strong enough to meet tomorrow’s
needs?
Perhaps our research will
The medicmes we discover may cherish
111m through tomorrow’s mile
