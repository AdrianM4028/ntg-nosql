It gives me immense pleasure to learn that the Recreation Club of Ministry of

Petroleum, Chemicals 8 Fertilizers is organising its annual function this year in
July, 1978,
Our Ministry plays a significant role in the stream of development of the country
in meeting the requirements of petroleum products, fertilizers. chemicals, drugs etc.
Our efforts should be directed towards self-sufficiency and self-reliance over a reaso-

nable period.

But this can be achieved only by solid determination and hard labour.

In order to enliven the mundane atmosphere prevailing in our establishments,
sports, games and other recreationary activities play an important part. Apart from
inculcating a spirit of kinship, they also help in taking victory and defeat in the same
st r i d e .

It is heartening to note that the Recreation Club has been organising sport
events, get togethers, entertainments, cultural programmes in the past also. Let us
hope, this will continue to undertake such healthy activities during the ensuing
year also.
I wish the Annual Function and its organisers all the success.
