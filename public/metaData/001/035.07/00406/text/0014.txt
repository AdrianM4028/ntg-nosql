whydon’tdoctorsfollow their own advice?
"Slow down", your doctor tells you,
”Leave office at 5.30. Spend more
time with your family"
And yet, he seldom follows his own
advice.
His is not an easy life.

indie has just one doctor for
every 4000 people. In some areas
the situation is much worse.
Yet each patient must receive
personal attention .
Your doctor is a human being
carrying an inhuman load. But he's
doing a marvellous job.
Helping him to heal
A few years ago, India faced a
different situation. Many of our vital
medicines were made from imported
basic drugs. Naturally, the prices
were high and supply was irregular.
To set matters right, Indian Drugs 8
Pharmaceuticals Ltd was created.
lDPL today, is the foremost
manufacturer of basic drugs and
medicines.
Billions of tablets, capsules and vials
of essential and life-saving medicines
go out to hospitals, dispensaries and
chemists all over the country.
This has meant a lot to the people.
Prices are kept in check and
shortages are being rapidly overcome.
There is another interesting feature
of lDPL‘s contribution. All the
pharmaceutical firms in India, even
those of international standing, rely
on basic drugs from lDPL to make
their own medicines.
They know lDPL drugs and
medicines meet world standards in
quality.
