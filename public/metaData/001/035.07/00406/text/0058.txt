700 steps to confidence

Public conﬁdence in modern medicines made in India—as
good as the world’s best—has been won the hard way.
Rigid quality control at every stage of production can mean

as many as 700 internal checks on a batch of medicine,
with every ingredient checked for purity, stability, efﬁcacy
and shelf life.
On an average. one out of every six persons employed in

pharmaceutical production works on quality control. The
drug industry employs a higher percentage of scientists
than most other industries— 15 per cent as compared with
4.8 per cent in the chemical industry and 0.8 per cent in
other industries. This kind of emphasis adds up to an
undisputed guarantee of world—class quality.
