As always.

ing decided on ' The Tempest ' . we were faced with two choices — the ﬁrst being to
allow all that is creative and fantastic in the play a free rein and support it with
everything at our command ; and the second. to minimalise the wildness and activity
that Shakespeare intended on stage and hope that the actors energy would put across
the message .Needles to say, we bravely chose the former, thereby saddling our—
selves with the inevitability of a high —budget production. Even as I write, finance
continues to be our main worry and I can just hope that things workout eventually.
In this production of 'The Tempest ’. moods have been kept intact. times have been
changed, the location could be anywhere. Prospero has been depicted as three different people to bring out the three clearly defined characteristics of his personality. A
revolving stage has been used to the continuous process of disorder and change that
plague the characters of the play. Coupled with intricate lighting and set design. the
play promises to be a visual spectacle.

There are some people without whom the production would have been in jeopardy;
I am deeply indebted to them Firstly. I 'd like to thank Zuleikha for her dedication
and involvement, which were of a degree I've never seen before. Dr. Roy, as always,

has been a pillar of strength. Vikram, thanks for taking the burden off my shoulders
- you probably handled things better than I could have. I would also like to thank
Rahul, Payal Mihir, J.J. and Kiran for their help and support; Antara, Anant. Amar.

Aftab. Arijit. Dhruv, Malati, Siddharth and the rest of the cast and crew for their
hard work.
