it is. she will probably be joining Gomia soon. In which case. the revolve could perhaps be called the cast
system. If she falls on her face. of course. the revolve will break.
Payal has been taking large amounts of money from the secretary supposedly for costumes. So far it
appears that the only wardrobe that has been increasing is hers-and that in proportion to her waistline and
mysterious trips to the cafe.
Amar has broken all records by submitting a transport bill for Rs. 400/—. Need we say his waist size is
also increasing.

So is Asthana's. And he's been finance co-ordinator for two years.
People are saying that if Siddharth Correya becomes secretary the Pr‘abltu family will follow tradition
and make it to the EC by methods not open to one half of humanity.
Akshay Roy’s near and dear ones have caused something ofa stir. especially around Rushad. Akshay
himself is in grave danger because of his objections. Apparently Rushad killed a rat in D-School under the

impression that it was Akshay. after a bath. Understandable mistake. Putatunda should watch out too.
Brighu and Prerna are still just good friends. All evidence to the contrary is inauthentic
Stuti is raising a stink when she is not tearing her hair out. Apparently. Nihal is not giving his all.
Zuleikha is worrying that the vigour in the love scenes is remarkably one-sided. But Nihal is not to be
blamed. I lis mind is probably occupied by thoughts ofhis aunt. His mind couldn't very well be occupied by

Sarah because given her size and that of the organ in question there wouldn't be enough left over to remind
him how to breathe.
11 seems that Mustafa has been cast as a person of doubtful gender and Correya as a drunk butler who
puts on an accent. Funny. . . I thought they joined ShakeSoc to act.
Nishtha isn't working much. I believe Sunando is planning to tell her that Aneesh Khanna is on the
‘
Shakesoe EC as well.

Sunando ‘without-a—eare-in—the-world' Sen has taken to keeping pets around the home. There's his
CAT. his electonie puppy and Choitali (puppy cat?)
। think that‘s about all. Baba. Don‘t forget to come for the shows and laugh at the places marked on the

script I gay e you. 1 wrote those bits.

P. S. Have you seen my Parachute hair oil’? Nobody else likes dandruff.
