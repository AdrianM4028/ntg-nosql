SECRETARY'S REPORT1 1937 'STEPHANIAN'
३ The Tempest' was staged by the Society in the College Hall on 9th, 10th and 1 1th of
February. There was a fair audience at the first two shows. whilst on the last day the Hall

was packed to its full capacity. Ariel with his silvery voice and graceful movements won
the hearts of all; Prospero spoke his lines well and acted with great dignity: Caliban was
really ‘calibanish': Trinculo and Stephano played the roles of Clown and drunkard very
effectively and became great favourites with the audience. Everyone was satisﬁed with
the general standard ofacting—but many wished to see more ‘Ariels’ and ‘ Prosperos' on the
stage. We wish the College could produce many more.
The success ofthe play depended largely on the hard labour put in by Mrs. Richardson
for which we are greatly indebted to her. The costumes and scenery were all designed by
her. We must not. however, forget the tireless efforts of Mr. Close to teach 'the dance‘ to
the Intermediate nymphs. I am sure Mr. Close did not know that teaching one. two. three—
one, two. three — could be a difficult as he found it i. The make- up waswell done for which
Mr. Sarkar and Mr. Richardson are to be congratulated. The girl-students must also be
thanked for helping the Secretary in disposing of many tickets—especially Miss Thakardas,
Miss Beckaya, and Miss Joseph for spending many a1 day without lunch and tea ! !
