Telling lies to the young is wrong

Proving to them that lies are true is wrong
Telling them that God is in his Heaven

And all is well with the world is wrong
The young know what you mean.
The young are people.

Tell them the difﬁculties can‘t be counted,
And let them see not only what will be
But see with clarity their present limes

"Say obstacles exist, they must encounter
Sorrow happens, hardship happens.
The hell with it, who never knew

The price [of happiness will not be happy.
Forgive no error you recognize,

It will repeat itself, increase,
And afterwards our pupils

Will not forgive in us what we forgave.
