Note

The play 'Andha Yug' has been a challenge to all theatre workers
always perturbing the creative self. It is an experience in itself
depicting the clashes between enduring faith and disbelief, the
rational war against irrational love and about hope winning ever
despair.
lt constantly unfolds the pathos of human values and relations
against the backdrop of the great epic evertold; 'Mahabharat',
marking the end of the era of truth with the death of Lord Krishna.
Each character reveals the various dimensions of human
nature caught in the fight between the sociological moral values
and the psychological self thus giving the presentation a
contemporary relevence.
As the director, what appealed to me the most is the plight ofeach
character'in the script rather than his mythological status and hence
I have brought them to a common level from the supernatural one.
All the characters are made to emerge from the chorus itself as
my chorus is more important through which the story is told.
The concept of mixing classical dance and music with the
traditional narrative style, is to strengthen the power of expression.
This has not come as an experiment, but as a necessity and I am sure
it will create in the audience, the desired impact.
