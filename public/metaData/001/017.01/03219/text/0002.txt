PREM JAGOR is a play of a pure, tender and unselfish
love between the younstersfrom a rural community. The play
depicts that emotional love supercedes the practical compro-

mises, other barriers and obstacles. It is quite innate and
natural. This natural and incredible love portrayed in the play is not
polluted due to other selfish human motives and greed. Handicap may

be physical but definitely it does not imply to mental or physical
disability.

About Director

Satish Gawas has been working as theatre activistfor last
eighteen years in Goa while doing so, he had shouldered many

10-12 plays that he had directed so far, because it has its uniqueness in

Director Says
Initially the script ofPrem Jagor is based on the Goanfolkform JAGOR.
It included both the technique of a folk play and concept of the theme
.
I have given special emphasis on songs, music and dance which
are the
distinct and inherent characteristics of a folk theatre. However due
care

has been taken to ensure that the central theme should not loose the
bearing while conceiving the production. Besides special efforts are
put
forth to spread the messages of human values and the principle of
high
regard and respect for womanhood; aimed by the playriglit.

The able gudance of Guru Shri Vasant Josalkar and immence
co-operation of my collegue Shri Kanta Gaude are the two factors that
played
the major role in my present endeavour.

Academy Goa for providing me the chance for dire
