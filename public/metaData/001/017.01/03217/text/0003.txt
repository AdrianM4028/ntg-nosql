Les Fourberies de Scapin in Konkani

Pitpiteachi Kartupa
To celebrate the 50 years of Indian Independence,
the French Embassy together with the General
Delegation ofAlliance Francaise in India, launched
two parallel projects. Having adaptations of
Moliere plays in different Indian languages on the
one hand, and translation and publication of short
stories from regional Indian languages into French,
on the other. Both these projects of Cultural
Exchange are implemented through the I 5 Alliance
strong network in the country.
Alliance Francaise de Goa, chose Les Fourberies de
Scapin for adaptation in Konkani. In order to have
the translation closest to the original, it was

important to translate directly from French. Goa’s
well known poet and littérateur, Dr. Manoharrai
Sardessai was entrusted this task, and hence was
born Pitpito, the Konkani Scapin, who regales
audiences with his kartupa.
The production is put up in collaboration with
Kala Academy Goa, with actors from their
Repertory group, Rangmell. The play is directed by
Dnyanesh Moghe, well known in the ﬁeld of
theatre and an alumnus ofKala Academy.
In the Konkani adaptation “Pitpiteachi kartup’a”,
necessary changes in names and setting are made.
French idioms are turned into Konkani ones, all the
time remaining faithful to the spirit ofthe play. The
scene is set in the nineteenth century Goa.

Shravan (Octave) is in love with Gomati (Hyacinte),

daughter of the money lender Govardhan

Gulabi (Zerbinette), a Gypsy girl and marries her. In
fact, Gulabi is Jairaj’s lost daughter. Both the
fathers are not in favour of their sons’ loves. The
two lovers ask for Pitpito’s (Scapin) help. Pitpito
with his mischievous machinations forces the two
fathers to succumb to his designs and at last they
consent to marry their sons to the girls of their
choice.
