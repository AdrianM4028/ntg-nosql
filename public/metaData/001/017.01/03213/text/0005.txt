D | R ECTO R ’S NOTE
The traditional folk theatre has close

relation with Bertolt Brecht’s concept of
epic theatre. The principle of ‘alienation’

which Brecht adapted in his writing as
well as presentation is derived from Oriental theatre which also exists in Indian folk theatre.

‘Teen Paishancho Tiatr’ has elements of satire and

parody - at the same time it is highly entertaining.
Although the plot is purely imaginary it also seems to be
real. It is a musical, rnulticast mob play.
The play has basically evolved through experimentation and improvisation. A vague picture of the form to be

used for presentation was in my mind when the
rehearsals began. The full script was not in hand but the
content was thoroughly discussed with the author. The
actors initially were not given the script. Instead, they
were asked to improvise certain scenes relevant to the
३ plot. Even the musical score was evolved right from
begining. The idea to use a wide range of musical
compositions was in synchronisation with the diversity
of language and plurality of the characters as depicted
by the play-wright.
Efforts are made to bring ‘lndianness’ and regional flavour
in such a way that the audiences from all sections of the
society would derive theatrical experience blended with
aesthetic pleasure while watching the play.
‘No matter how fearful the problems they handle, plays
should always be playful.’ —— These are the words of
Bertold Brecht. l have tried to do justice to this thought.

That is why I have adopted a free form instead of
choosing a particular ‘ism’ or style.
I have given necessary freedom to all the performers
and the artistes to explore their charecter and discover
their actions and reactions within the given space.
This is one of the reasons that ‘Teen Paishancho Tiatr’ is
the creative outcome of all those who are involved in the

production process.
