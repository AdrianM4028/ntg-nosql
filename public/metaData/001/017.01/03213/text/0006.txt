M U S I C DIRECTOR’S NOTE
Composing the music of this multifarious

play came as a sheer pleasure to me. At
the same time it was a thrilling
experience. The lyrics - composed by the

author himself contained a lot of variety
which came as a challenge to all my experience in the

field of music. I have tried to make use of all types of

music, which can cater to all the sections of the society.
At the same time I have tried to adopt the ultrarnodern
musical techniques which go in accordance with todays
techno musical revolution. l sinceerly thank my
instrumentalists viz Vishnu Shirodkar, Mayuresh Vast,
Milind Chari, Prakash Amonkar, Vishwas Chari for the
excellent accompaniment they have provided.
