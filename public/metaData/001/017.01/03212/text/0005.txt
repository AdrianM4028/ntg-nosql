The Play deals with the impaccable relation of human beings with Mother Nature. The Indian philosophy,
right from the times of Vedas and Upanishads, has taught us to bow in sacred reverance to the supreme
power of Universe as manifested in the natural entities. However, Man slowly started distancing himself
from these teachings and he took to the destruction of natural beauty just to satisfy his lust and hunger
for his personal luxuries. Ultimately man evolved as the biggest destructor of Mother Nature.

The play tries to explore this age-old relation in an entertaining, yet educate manner-though the content

is very serious, the overall mould of presentation has been deliberately shaped in a playful manner. To

maintain informality, we have stressed on shaping the script basically through improvisations done
during the rehearsals, so that even the actors could participate in the process of creation.

By nature, the play is multilingual. This has been done keeping in view a cosmopolitan audience-which
would like everything from recitation of Vedrnantras to film parodies.

We have also used extracts from Upanishadic stories, folk traditions, Jataka tales, Panchant
antra and

other oral literary streams that have been flowing through the ages. Attempt has also been
made to add
a Goan ﬂavour - which is very typical and disctinct. The traditional Goan
“tiatro” (Christian Theatre)
also came useful to make this play a bit more colourful.
