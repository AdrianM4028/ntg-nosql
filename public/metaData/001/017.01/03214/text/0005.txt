‘ RANGM ELL’
It is a well known fact that, people of this State have

tremendous amount of interest in the theatre art. With a
view to giving a boost to the development of this faculty
and putting it on a scientific pedestal the Kala Academy
started School of Drama in 1987. A natural corollary of _
the functioning of School of Drama for a few years, was
the establishment of Repertory Company ‘Rangmell’.

‘Rangmell’ provides a platform for professional training to
the graduates of School of Drama as well as local talent. :
It helps them gain confidence, develop the attitude of
collective responsibility and mutual understanding 1 _ ३ ३
