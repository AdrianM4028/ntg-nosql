BAKASUR !A traditional SUTRADHAR starts introducing the play to
the audience, when a modem SUTRADHAR interferes

and frankly confesses that a traditional entertainment with
classical decorations is not possible in the present
circumstances. However, they would present a

mythological play inevitably mixed with contemporary
social and political situations. We see five modem youths

transformed into Pandavas who, along with their mother, ’
enter a city ruled by terror. They are looking for a shelter

when a honest journalist is killed before their eyes. No
citizen is ready to give him a decent cremation for the fear

of a Swami an ardent worshipper of Bakasur the Demon.

But Bhim decides to confront the Demon. Thus starts

BAKASUR!

’

The play takes its inspiration from Bakasur episode of
Mahabharat wherein Bhim kills Bakasur, the demon, fed

and fostered by the king himself. The episode is neatly
linked with the growing terrorism sponsored by various
political parties working hand in hand with the underworld.

Yet the play is not only a mythological parallel but
an
innovative superimposition of two themes, one mode
rn
and another classical, a fusion of two
different

atmospheres working simultaneously on two sepa
rate
planes to create a unified impact. It is also unique in
letting

the audience think for themselves and also affo
rds a
glimpse in the characters of the actors who play
the key
roles. The imaginatively constructed play is surnptuo
usly
mounted by free use of music, dance and
colour.
