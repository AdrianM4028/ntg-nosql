Doing business in Eastern Europe
might raise some questions.

If that’s the question,
we might have the answers.
As Eastern Europe changes rapidly,
there are undoubtedly new business
opportunities to be exploited. But the
question which arises, is whether prudence
might be more appropriate than enterprise.

३ For a satisfactory answer you need a
reliable business partner who feels at home
all over Europe, speaks its languages and
knows its ways. A leading bank like ABN
AMRO Bank which has blazed the trail,
opening new branches in many East European countries and which has made a firm
commitment to persevering through.
With this headstart, we can guide
you through unfamiliar economies and
jurisdictions, pointing out the pitfalls, set-

ting you on a profitable course. The way
we do it is plying you with critical questions. And as a reliable guide, we never
pretend to have the answer when we don’t.
In any event, you benefit from our
solid financial foundation of US $ 242.7
billion in assets and US $ 9 billion in shareholders’ equity. But just as significant is
the fact that you also benefit from a business partner who knows that the right
questions are as important as the right

answers.
