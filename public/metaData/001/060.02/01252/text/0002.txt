The Play

The question now arisen as to who should be the victim.

ultimately agree for secret ballot.

They

Each one compaigns for his safety and gives reasons

in favour of his right to live on.

In the process of voting, there occurs some foul play; as there are four ballot papers
in the box (in this case—a hat) instead of three.

It is then proposed that someone with

a sense of sacrifice must offer himself voluntarily, and Sookhata is considered to be the
best choice. Sookhata rejects it and claims for justice. It is revealed that except Sookhata,
the other two are orphans and the orphans

should. in no case, be killed if the cause of

justice is to be honoured. In the meantime, the death of Sookhata’s mother is conveyed
and all the three fall beck in the same category—orphans.

While exploring the element of historical justice it is found that Sookhata's father
was a clerk in an office and Mota's father was a woodcutter, and Majhola had no father
at all. The clerk was a bureaucrat and Mota's father the woodcutter—a labourer. Therefore,

the historical justic goes agains Sookhata. It is settled that Sookhata should be killed.

The pressure mounting on Sookhata

becomes so unbearable that he becomes

mentally deranged and virtually gives cansent.

Tneprocese starts.

But, luckily Mote

and Majhola get some tinned food and start eating in a corner Seeing this Shookhata
comes back to his senses and proclaims that he will not die.
