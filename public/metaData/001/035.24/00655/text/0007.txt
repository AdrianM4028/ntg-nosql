his concepts of love and history: Eve and Kathchen, Alkrnene
and Penthesilea. They are so many enhancements and exaggerations of the concept of “Love”, as most of the love poetry of

our literature has remained ﬁxed in the fate of Gretchen.

For

Kleist’s girls’ and women it is not a matter of private or married
happiness or unhappiness, but of veriﬁcation and conﬁrmation,
of conﬁdence in the origin and feeling of the high, irnpregnable
vocation. Lovers give themselves up and hand themselves over,
to earn a real existence. The dying Toni in Betrothal in San
Domingo complains that she should have been trusted, and the
humble Eve of the Broken Jug protests against making admission 3 to the tribunal which do not concern it. She possesses a
secret of which Adam knows only the word : Love.

The Broken Jug is a major and regularly performed classic
of the German comic theatre; indeed, Adam and Frau Martha
Rull are a part of dramatic tradition. Written in verse, the play
opens with a petty larceny trial in an eighteenth-century village.

As further circumstances come to light the bumbling

local

magistrate is forced to go to increasingly absurd lengths to
protect the real culprit—himself. In attempting this lively production we have tried to capture the spirit and complexity of the
play, the earthiness of the characters, the humour - and the
tragedy, for the play raises fundamental issues and reﬂects the
elements in Kleist’s work that demonstrate his continuing
importance as a rnaior European dramatist.
