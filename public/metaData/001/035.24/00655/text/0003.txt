PREFACE TO THE PLAY by Heinrich von Kleist
The origins of this comedy lie in all probablity in historical
fact, although I remain in ignorance of the details. A copper
engraving which I saw several years ago in Switzerland led to
. the writing of the play. The ﬁrst ﬁgure which caught my eye was

that of a judge solemnly seated on the bench.

An old woman

was standing in front of him, holding a broken jug; she appeared to be demonstrating the unjust treatment it had received.
The accused was a young farrnhand who was weakly attempt-

ing to assert his innocence in the face of the fulrninations of
the judge, for whom guilt was proven. A girl who had probably testiﬁed in the case (who knows what the circumstances
surrounding the offence had been?) was standing between her
mother and her ﬁance, twisting her hands; she could not have
cut a more sorrowful ﬁgure it ‘she had given false evidence.

The clerk of the court, who had perhaps a moment before been
looking at the girl, was now glancing sideways in distrust at

the judge; rather in the manner of Creon looking, in similar circumstances at Oedipus when the question was being asked :

who killed Laius?

The title below read : THE BROKEN JUG.

if I am not mistaken the original painting was by a Dutch
master.
