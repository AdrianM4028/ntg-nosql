There is a youthful poem of Kleist’s in two versions, the
Jitnglingsklage (Lament of Youth), of which the second runs :
”Winter retreating
grizzled and dear,
stilled all our feeling
to ice, hard and clear.

Now under Springtime’s
exuberant breath
the streams are all thawing,
and you too, my breast!"
What winter’s passing is lamented here and what exuberant spring does the poet fear? Like almost all Kleist’s work,
this poem also conceals more than it reveals. One finds in it a
universality of judgement, the youth’s feeling played out through
the motif of the contrasting seasons, through the imagery of
which the mysterious sensual torment of boyhood glirnrners.

Kleist feared lust because he feard its pararnountcy, and begs
winter to still his feelings into ice In his utterances on love we
find an astounding realism which is converted at a certain level

into pure lasciviousness, in the person of the village judge
Adam in The Broken Jug, who likes getting in with pretty girls
at night, whereas on another level it is the extreme of gallantry,

in the person of Jupiter approaching Alkrnene in Amphitryon.
Love, in particular, contains a dialectical ‘for' and ‘against’;
it is love which shows human beings in the entanglement of
spiritual and physical, of the psyche and the body. So we have

on the one hand the efforts of Adam to taste the most primitive
side of love, physical possession, and on the other side stands
Evchen, the sweet creature whose very existence lies in the

preservation of what Adam would like to steal like a thief in the
night. Appearances are against Evchen and the guilty judge
Adam encourages the world of this false appearance and thereby commits his crime: the false attribution of guilt to the innocent. One should not try to mould Adam and Eve on the basis

of their names, as though Kleist's Broken Jug were a cryptodrarna on the fall of the ﬁrst man. Insofar as the biblical Fall
