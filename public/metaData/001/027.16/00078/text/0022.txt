Once upon a time there lived a

Brahmin.

One day

as he was returning home after a big feast he decided to
rest a bit under the shade of a big tree, he opened the
_ bundle in which his host had packed some food and began
to count the loaves of bread. He found that if his family

shared the loaves equally, there would still be one extra
left. Realising that this extra loaf could be the cause of
a quarrel at home, he decided to leave it in the jungle so
that some needy animal could enjoy it.

He had hardly left when two wild cats pounced upon
the loaf and began to ﬁght over it. One claimed she had
SEEN the loaf ﬁrst, and the other contended that she had

TOUCHED it ﬁrst.

So they gnarled and hissed at each

other, clawed at each other, but could find no solution.

Just then a fox came by.
She asked
them why they were fighting. When the
cats had explained she slyly suggested that
the loaf may be given to her to establish
peace. But of course the cats could not
be taken in so easily and they refused.
The fox angrily muttered something
under her breath, and left them.
Soon
after a meek little mouse who was taking
a walk, passed by them. The cats appealed to him for help,
but added that if he was unable to divide the loaf properly, his life would be in danger. Now the little mouse
did not want to take any risks and before the cats could
grab him he quickly slipped away.
