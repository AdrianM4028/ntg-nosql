Madho Baba was about to return home to give his wife
the good news when his friend Chalaku Ram met him.
But
Madho Baba told him all about the wonderful plate.

Chalaku Ram was a very cunning man. He fooled poor
Madho Baba. He put his own ordinary plate in the old
man’s bundle and ran away with the magic one.

Soon after Madho Baba’s wife came out looking for
him.

She found her husband very happy and he told her

all about the plate.

Then he took it out and told her to

ask for anything she liked. The old woman asked for a
loaf of bread. But alas ! on the plate there appeared
nothing!
She was very annoyed with her husband and
went home.

Madho Baba tried the trick again.

“Should I eat one,

Should I eat two, Should I eat all of them.” , This time

the fairies gave him a magic hen which laid golden eggs.
Madho Baba decided to take a little nap before going home
to show it to his wife. But in the meanwhile Chalaku
Ram came and seeing that Madho Baba was asleep, he
slipped away with the magic hen.
Now the old man became very unhappy and began to

cry.
The fairies. however, had seen that Chalaku Ram was
thief and they decided to punish him. So they gave
Madho Baba, a magic stick. Next time when Chalaku Ram
tried to be clever, he got the stick of course and the
stick started beating him very hard and did not stop till
Chalaku Ram returned the plateand hen to Madho Baba.

The bad man thus realised that it did not pay to be too
clever.
