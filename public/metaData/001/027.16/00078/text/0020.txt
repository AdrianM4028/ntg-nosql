Now bear in mind what the Prime Minister has
you.

told

Of course you are impatient to see the plays but do
you know who wrote these three plays which you are

going to see ?

He is ROM ESH MEHTA. Romesh is a short, stout, little
fellow. And what is interesting is that one of his teeth
like that of some of you is broken. You know children
loose their milk-teeth. But Romesh lost it in a fall when
he was a child. He remembers having broken that tooth.
We are sure. many of you have had a fall one time or
the other and have broken your teeth. In any case
we wish that you preserve your teeth. Now let us give
up the talk about teeth and come to tell you something
about Romesh.
Romesh went to school and from early childhood he
loved writing and he loved writing so much that so far
he has written 20 plays all of which have been staged at
one time or the other.
Besides the three plays you are going to witness. the
Three Arts Club has produced eleven of his plays like
India Today, Jahez, Dasturi, Faisla. Zamana, Hamara Gaon,
Pagal, Uljhan, Dhong, Under Secretary and Roti aur Beti.
Romesh won the best playright award of the Delhi Natya
Sangh in l95l and l 952 and was mentioned for corn“Aur Bhagwan
rnendable acting in Mama Warerkar’s
Dekhta Raha" staged by the Club during the Centenary
Celebration of the First War of Independence. Romesh
has also acted in all plays written by him and produced by
the Three Arts Club.
Here it will interest you to know that Romesh loved
acting even when he was a child like you. He sought new
roles but as the luck would have it, he was always assigned
the role of a monkey.

We. hope that most of you will also take to writing
and acting like Romesh. And let us hope that your plays
Will also be staged as the ones you are to see now.
I And now let us give you the stories of the three

pays.
