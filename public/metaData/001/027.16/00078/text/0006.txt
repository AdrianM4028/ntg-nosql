. ' ﬁcompartment choking with luggage
with passengers positioning themselves
like plums in a cake.

,

When the

train reaches a station, men, women
and children clamber out.

Endless

bedding-rolls, suitcases, pots and pans

pour out through doors and windows,
and by the time the train starts again,

some of the goods may still remain to
be cleared.

All this could be avoided

if passengers had put their heavier

luggage in the brake-van.

Next time

please do so for a comfortable rail journey
