configure nostalgia, then the sound-space of memory — relayed in the living voice of Vidya
herself — to create a resonating dimension.
Nilima Sheikh and Badrinarayanan's stage design seeks to create these real and imaginary
spaces, spaces of dream, reverie, and desire. The mis-en-scene quotes from the traditions of
miniature painting and puts to question the naturalistic ways of figuring a character within the
single point of View. The theatric meaning of colour, volume, Vista — of the vignettes of image
painted in Nilima's own manner are like Vidya's in the dimension of memory as well —memory of an oriental aesthetic where everything appears to unfold pictorially as if on a
splendid screen.
Using her long experience as actress and designer, Dolly Ahluwalia has worked through the
colours and details of traditions of miniature painting, inventing a series of costume that do not
attempt to recreate a period specifically but to expand the mis-en—scene with pictorial quotations. ].5. Shraddha’s poster has been devised on a late nineteenth century photograph of a

this production making a rich contribution.
I am enormously grateful to the actors who have stayed with the production from the time
when Geetanjali was writing up the text, to when Vidya conceived the music to now when
Nilima and Badri have fabricated the set. Working through the text with Uttara Baokar has
been a real pleasure. I am very grateful to her.
