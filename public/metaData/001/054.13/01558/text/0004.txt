Ruswa's
master narrative — the kidnapping of an innocent child, her initiation into the arts of a
courtesan, her brilliant, lightning-like career and then her old age in which she recognizes her

sins and repents. The courtesan's life almost always describes this arc. Yet a novel like Umrao
Jan Ada has spaces in which to introduce shifts. The spoken (auto) biographical mode of the
novel can be interrupted and resumed at different planes of reﬂection. And, correspondingly,
the novel as dramatized by Geetanjali Shree is emphatically positioned. The play has been
structured to include soliloquys where characters, specially Umrao, think through their circumstances and try and align their many worlds. Is Umrao more woman when young and less
woman when old? Does old age ungender women; can a woman character be neither Victim nor hero, someone just ordinary; can the ordinariness of her life be part of the storyline of the

play; and in what voice can a woman, specially a woman as iconic as Umrao, talk about fear or
aloneness or the small and big longings of life.

Even as you ask these questions the world of the noVel opens out, the world relayed from a
real/unreal woman to a male writer — both fictions in the hands of the present writer, a
woman here and now.‘ This is not a whole substantial world but several and they are incomplete, these several worlds. The characters reﬂect on the meaning of friendship and companionship for example, and on romance, desire, and gender. Events fix and unfix, loop and swell and

even fall away. These worlds are made up of memory and of reminiscence, where the gaze is
refocused every time as it moves inward and outward, connecting private events with glittering careers.
