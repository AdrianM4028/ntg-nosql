Dronacharya, the great Guru of Kauravas and
l’andavas ! the education and training imparted by him to
the young princes, no doubt, made them great warriors,
but devoid of humanity. This, according to the author,
was the real cause of vast death
Mahabharata.

and destruction

in

Why did not the great Guru creat perfect human
beings, instead of revengeful, power-seeking, warriors है
Why did he demand, and had, Eklavya’s thumb as

Gurudakshina, though he had refused to teach and train
him on the basis of his being a tribal youth ?
The facts on record prove him to be a great teacher
turned into a crafty, comfort-loving and compromising
man, bowing bef’ore injustice and siding with the unjust
and barbarous Kauravas. And in the battle of Kurukshetra, his own mighty ﬂaws recoiled on him, in the
form of truthful Yudhistra’s announcement, regarding

Ashwatthama’s death, resulting in the tragic end of this
Guru.

But what made this great idealist Guru to compromiSe
draggingf'himself to his own doom ‘?
And what forces the great intellectuals and teachers of
to-day‘ to compromise, and to lead themselves to their
own doom ?

Perhaps power, perhaps circumstances, perhaps sociopolitico-econormc envrronment, perhaps the innate human

weakness” ~The play probes !
