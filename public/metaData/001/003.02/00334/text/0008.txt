The Director

Prasanna was born on March 23,

1951 in Karnataka. A student of
science, he completed his Master’s

Degree in Inorganic Chemistry
with distinction in 1971 and joined
the Indian Institute of Technology

(Kanpur) as a research scholar.
Soon, however, he gave up science
for theatre. From 1972 to 1975 he
acquired training as a stage-director

at the National School of Drama.
Since 1975 he has worked mainly in

the \Kannada theatre as a playwright,
director and designer and has been
instrumental in building Samudaya,
a state-wide cultural movement

in Karnataka which uses theatre
for radical mass education. He has
directed several plays of Brecht,
Shakespeare and Kannada

playwrights and writers like G.B.
J‘oshi and 'I‘ejasvi. Prasanna has
three major plays to his credit as a
playwright-director, namely, 0ndu
Loka Katha, Dange. . . . and

Tadroopz’. At present he is working
on a new play under the Sangeet
Natak Akademi Fellowship for
Young Playwrights and Directors.
