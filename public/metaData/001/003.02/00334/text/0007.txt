From the Playwright

Tughlaq, my second play, was
written and published in 1964. I

I think that a person struggling
against failures and failing more

chose a historical theme after I came
across a masterly book on Kannada
literature called Nadedu Banda
Daari which said that Kannada had

must have somewhere found

an immediate echo in me.

produced no signiﬁcant historical
(Enact June ’71)
plays. This was a challenge. I went
through a history book and came
across Tuglaq. It was a marvellous
discovery. I started collecting
data on him. I had no idea how the
play was going to shape until I had
been at it for nearly a year and a

half. Then things started falling
into place,

What struck me absolutely about

Tughlaq’s history was that it was
contemporary. The fact that here
was the most idealistic, the most

intelligent king ever to come on the
throne of Delhi, and one of the

greatest f'ailures also. And within
a span of twenty years this

tremendously capable man had

gone to pieces This seemed to be
both due to his idealism as well
as the shortcomings within him, such

as his impatience, his cruelty, his
feeling that he had the only correct
answer. I felt that in the early
sixties India had also come very
far in the same direction—
the twenty year period seemed

to me very much a striking
parallel.
However, contemporaneity aside,
one ultimately picks on a theme

because somewhere it hits one.
