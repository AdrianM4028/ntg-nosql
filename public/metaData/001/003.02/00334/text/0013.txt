Scene 12. Daulatabad Fort.

Shaken by the violent riots in the
city and the unpredictable temper
of the Sultan, Azam loses his nerve
and, against the advice of Aziz,
tries to escape.
Scene 13. Daulatabad Fort.
A Terrace.

Barani begs for leave to depart
for his mother’s funeral. The news
of Azam’s murder is brought. Aziz
admits to the hoax and goes on to
relate his life story, which is a
chronicle of how he has exploited

all of the Sultan's ideals for his

own purposes. His own immoral

life is a parody of the Sultan’s high
motives. Barani urges the Sultan

to destory Aziz by torturing him.
But the Sultan has, for the ﬁrst
time, met a man who understands
him. He lets Aziz go with the

promise of a post in the army.
Exhausted by the searing revelation,
he expresses his wish to return to
Delhi with his people. Barani,

horriﬁed by the element of violence
that he has found within himself,
begs for permission to leave

before he completely succumbs
to It.
