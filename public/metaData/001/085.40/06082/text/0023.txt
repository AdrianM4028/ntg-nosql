teachers who work at several levels

groups of children.

Firstly they perform plays for different age

These p ays are aimed at creating awareness for them to

question som of the prevalent attitudes in the society around them.

These could

be attitudes towards environment, towards religion or even towards parent-child
relationships. In all such plays the attempt is to see the problems from the child’s
point of View - so that one is not talking down to them but placing them centre
stage. The Company also prepares plays which are directly linked to some areas
of children’s formal study. in order or make their lesson come more alive and

therefore become a part of their live experience to which they can relate directly

them to use their imagination and creativity to create their own plays In this way
children learn to choose, explore and discover themselves.

Our aim is to build a rapport with parents, teachers, psychologists and other
who share the same concerns. Through regular participatory workshops, through
mutual co-operation and involvement we can help children grow into adults who
are curious, imaginative and confident of making choices based on ethical values.
We therefore hope that The TIE becomes a countywide movement and helps in a
healthy growrh of our future generation.
