Principal’s Note

While I have been consulted from time to time and even subscribed my signature whenever necessary while THE MIRACLE WORKER was being prepared for staging by the J MCites, l have been very much an onlooker and even an outsider to the extent that l have not»
read the text or witnessed a rehearsal up to the date of writing this note.

To all engaged with the work of production,

I very sincerely say: I appreciate you,

your sense of dedication and your ability to work hard and to attend to detail.

Within a

team effort such as yours there are manifold roles, it is important that these complement

one another and it is pleaSant to witness you striving to achieve oneness in this reSpect.

Those who perform on the stage and those immediately concerned with production and

direction will, I trust, receive merited acclaim from the critics.

There are others who may

be forgotten eg, those concerned with the thankless chores that support the smooth
running of rehearsals and those whose function it is to ensure that enough money is forth-

coming for those necessary "extras" for cast and helpers.

While these others, I would

venture to wager, work the harder, and shoulder the more responsiblilty they also benefit the

more from their experience with economics, social living, and perhaps a measure of politics.

The faculty immediately involved with English dramatics in J MC have been
readily
available to inspire and to guide and to support, yet it naturally fell to the lot of
the student
president of the drarnatics society to accept for herself these thankless chores.
With a spirit
of confidence and commitment that is at once traditional and unique Afshaan
Shafi of the

111 year English

Honours class has accepted and played her role.

And so it is with a

modest sense of pride that I look forward to see THE MIRACLE WORKER
.
