in 1880, Helen Keller was blinded by an illness when she was only 6 months old. lnspite
of being deaf and blind, she was a very intelligent child. The рео violent fits of temper that
she exhibited in her childhood were not mere fits of madness, but the expression of her
pent-up frustration which was the result of her inability to communicate.

helping Helen to communicate and reach out to the world outside.
