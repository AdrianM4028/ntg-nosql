This year being the birth-centenary year of Helen Keller (1880-1980), the English
Dramatics Society decided to stage The Miracle Worker, a play based on her life.
Barry John readily agreed to direct the play. Before selecting the cast for the play, a
series of drama workshops were organised by him to familiarise the girls with ‘theatre
mechanics’ .
The English Dramatics Society has also been very active meanwhile. Various cornrnittees were formed to involve as many students as possible in the production of the play.
