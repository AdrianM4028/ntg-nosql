I mpact of Vaishnavism on Manipuri Culture

Indian culture represents a composite product. To identify Indian culture with Aryanism is now an exploded

stream of Indian culture is believed to
have commenced in North India in,
the Indus and Ganges valleys. In the
opinion of the scholars like Dr. S. K.
Chatterjee, this process of synthesis
took a deﬁnite shape towards the end
of the Vedic period (roughly 1000 BC.)
The contributions of the Dravidians
and other non-Aryan elements constitute as much as 75% of the composite
Indian culture which even extended
to Indo-China and Indonesia. To
quote Dr. S. K. Chatterjee, “Like
the warp and the woof of a piece
of woven stuff, the Indian or Hindu
Civilisation and culture, as a ﬁnished
and completed product, is the result
of a profound intermingling of the
Aryan and the Non-Aryan, in race,
in language and in the various items

of material as well as mental and
spiritual culture”.

But here also one does not always
stand on a ﬁrm ground. Opinions are
still divergent as to whether the Big
veda represents the earliest monument
of Aryan or Indo-European mental
life or a composite product of the
Indian mind. The samhita texts of the
Vedas were brought into their present
form at a much later date and it is
just possible that the editors might
have exercised their discretion in ex—

punging such texts. It is also possible
that the 'I‘antric view of life which
emerged from the 'I‘arrtric belt of
North India which extends, in the

opinion of a Bengali scholar, Dr. S.B.
Dasgupta, from Kashmir and passes
through Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, Kamrup and Bengal ( and most possibly

ancient Manipur also in my opinion ),
might have crept into the samhitas
of the Rigveda. The present stage
of Indo-logical Research reveals an
inadequate understanding of the
people of Tibet and Central Asia,

more particularly of the culture of
