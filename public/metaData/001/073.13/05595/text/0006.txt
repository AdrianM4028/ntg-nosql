Dear Shri Singh,
I am very happy to know that an all Manipur Theatre
Conference is to be held in December. I am glad to send you
my sincerest good wishes on this happy occasion. The Manipur
Natya Sangh has always been a very active and enterprising
body. Manipur as the Centre of great culture has much to
contribute to the Theatre movement of India.
I congratulate the Theatre artists on this project and wish
the Conference every success.

Yours sincerely,

KAMALADEVI CHATTOPADHYAY
