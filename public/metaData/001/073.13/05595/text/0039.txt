Shankha, Chakra, Anjali, Tarkshya, Pasha, Karkata, Samputa, Ram—

bhasuma, Pushpaputa, Kokila, Swastika, Shuka.
All the above variations can be

presented in one of the three following
distinct ways :

(l) Swanugata : In which angikabhinaya ( body movements ) is independent and extremely important
which seek to convey its own meaning.
Even when the body movements are
complimented by songs, they do not
seek to interprete the exact meaning
of the songs. This is extremely suitable
for Krishna’s play like Kanduka
Krida ( Ball game ) and Bolikakrida

(Festival of colours ) etc.
(2; Anugata : In which vachika—
bhinaya is extremely important and
angikabhinaya i. 6. body movements
are evolved to interprete the meaning
of geeta, prabandha and vakya.
(3) Gamaka : In which though the
vachik‘abhinaya is important the body
movements are evolved only to suggest
the meaning of geet prabandha and
Vakya.

(4) Nritya Bandha : Any dance composition and choreogoraphy evolved for
the purpose of any one or more of the
four abhinayas and in any one of the
above types ( i. e. either swanugata,
anugata and gamaka) is recognised
as Nritya Bandha.
Indian texts classify Natya into
two varieties. Rupaka—Major forms
of Drama and Uparupakasnminor
fOrms of Drama in which music and

dance predominate.

While according

to the Manipuri texts, particularly
the Govind Sangeet Leela Vilasa,
Natya is classiﬁed into Rupakas and
Rasakas, Rupaka means drama and
Rasaka means dance-drama.

The imortant

dance

dramas of

Manipur are Rasleelas, celebrated at

different occasions. Maharas on the
full moon day of Kartik, Vasantras
on the full moon day of Chaitra, Kunjs
ras, on the eighth day of the month
of Ashvin, Nityaras performed at
any occasion, GOpa Ras ( Goshtha ‘,
in the month of Kartik and Udukhal
Ras in the month of Kartik.
The ﬁrst four Rasleelas—«relate
Krishna’s amorous play with Radha
and GOpis and the other two depict
the adventures and pranks of Lord
Krishna.
The dramatic description of Rasleelas are found in Vaishnava texts like
Geetachandrodya Ashtamaparicheda
