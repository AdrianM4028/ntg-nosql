MANIPURI THEATRE AS OTHERS LOOK AT IT

high order.

Many provinces which

consider themselves foreward, could

take a lesson from this troupe” ८- Mama
Warerkar ( Sangeet Ratak Akademi
Bulletin 3 of July 1955 ).
“The production showed a praiseworthy striving after realism. The
stage settings were simple and effective, the costumes, colourful and gen-

uine and the effect of the piece was
altogether charming. 'I‘he groupings on
the Whole were also commendable. But
surely the most pleasing aspect of the
play were the songs and dances, adaptations from the ancient Manipuri
tunes, which heightened the effect of
the piece and were instrumental in
giving it an authencity which it would
have otherwise lacked.”

( The Statesman—Dec. 25, 1954 )
“The Superb acting by the troupe

from Manipur showed the genius of
the Manipuris at their very best. The
play was powerfully acted, depictinor
the tribesmen in all their virility and

61

vigour as also showing the tender
sentiments of their wmnen folk and
youth. The play had every thing—
thrill, suspense, tragedy and sparkling
dialogue
. The role of the heroine,
Saphabi was exquisitely rendered by
Tondon Devi
.”
(The Times of India—Dec. 25, 1954:)
“It was a truly pleasurable thing
to peformers attempting to transform
this story into reality on the stage.
To those who saw it, there cannot be

the slightest doubt about the delicate,
aesthetic sense that seems to be part
of the consiousness of the Manipuri
people. Practically no detail had been
ignored in the presentation. The sets

were remarkably realistic. The songs
and dances, as was to be expected,
were very appealing. And there was
plenty of good natural acting. ']‘ondon
Devi, who played the role of the princess, distinguished herself particu—
larly”. ( The Hindusthan Standard——
Dec. 25, 1954 )
