NOTE. ON THE 'I‘HATlI—TOTAL AND MANIPUII

«if the seminar still keeps on ringing
in my ears : out of the chaos came
the most constructive contacts. Little
'ﬁne threads are thrown across the
'world weaving the cloth of understanding. Beautiful words, these indeed ! Personally I had the rare privilege of meeting face to face some of the
eminent theatre personalities of the

East and West, listening to them and
sharing also a little of our deep
thoughts and experiences. It was a
good seminar, after all, and perhaps
Miss R. Guilder was not far from right
when she characterised it as “one of
the best I have attended.”

My eyes practically feasted on
deeply moving spectacles of some of
the performances of the Theatre Festival. 'I‘agore’s “Raja” presented by
Sambhu Mitra and his group was an
excellent play which any nation can
'be proud of. I shall not take up the
detailed discussions about all the
plays and dance dramas. But seeing
the Indonesian balletmﬁamayana
( presented in three instalments ) I
was at once transported into a dream
world of my forefathers, listening to
timeless and far-off intimations, fully

overwhelmed by the haunting beauty
of its rendering.
This is what an
Asian ballet should be like. Compared
to this ﬁne spectacle, Kalakshetra’s
Geet Govinda, Mrinalini’s Darpana,

Kathakali and Kuchipudi presentations

pale into insigniﬁcance. It is now
perhaps time that exponents of Indian
culture should learn to be a little
modest. It is true that we inherit a
great tradition and yet we have not
made it greater, by keeping our eyes
and ears open. And what a satire
and humour in the Czech pantomime
show and what delightful three Nomuras displaying a degree of stylisa—
tion and the Japanese genius of econo~
my of expression 1 These are some of
the excellent species of the Asian V
theatre which must be closely studied
and properly appreciated in the con—
text of enriching our own Indian
dance-dramas. If this festival teaches
us anything, it is this that the Indian
exponents of our rich
heritage
should learn to be a little humble

( with selfurespect, of course ) and be
prepared to proﬁt by the beauty of
the neighbouring countries regarding
their theatrical expressions.

I have now before mean ofﬁcial
summary ofthe discussions drafted
by Shiv Kapur (India) and accepted

unanimously in the recent East-West
Theatre Seminar at New Delhi. It ३
makes apparently graceful reading
but strikes me as something off the
main tract of our discussions. It is
evidently a compromise which. along
with that resolution on Total Theatre,

is forced by many on a protesting few,
leading to almost a crossing of ﬂoors
