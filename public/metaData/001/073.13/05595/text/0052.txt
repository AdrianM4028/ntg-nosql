that modern theatre which seeks “to

assumption which cannot stand a
close scrutiny. This is as good as

I saying that Shakuntala or king Lear

Art is not an instrument “to

hammer question marks into exclae

as a modern substitute for artistic
vision, despite the cry from Rukmini Devi and some others; I am
happy that India has such eminent
theatre personalities like E. Alkazi

reafﬁrm faith in contemporary theatre

to note that even the Delhi press
could not ( or did not ) do justice to
Mr. Alkazi, though I personally liked

some of their comments ( more particularly of Shiv Kapoor ) on the entire proceedings. The presence of such
