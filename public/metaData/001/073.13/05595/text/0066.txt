of a few drama-loving ladies,

MJIUPUBI THEATBE‘

who,

since 195:2,ihas been staging dramas,
particularlyduring the Durga Pujas.

The y have since produced with much
SUCOPSs “Ma-ir Ghar”, “Laxmir Pari-

kha”, "Tabe Keman Hata”, “Jhansir
Bani” r-tc. Some of the actress of this
group are—Bhndan Das, Deepali
Choudhury, Vijaya Sen, Anima Dutta,
etc.

At present, a new wave is being
seen for repairing the old damaged
hall and stage and a special interest
has been found among those postcwar
actors of Victoria Club and among
some young people of Bazar areas
who are contemplating the better-

ment of Bengali Drama in the light of
advanced thoughts of present dramatic world. I trust this would materialise with the production of modern
dramas in well-equiped modern stage.
In 1952 some of the actors and
dramayloving gentlemen of Bazar
Area, who were previously connected
with Victoria Club, formed a separate
group and have produced a series of
remarkable dramas with much com-

pet‘ence and consistency. They have;
rendered incomparable service ., for.~
over a decade to make the theatreri
movement free. from all sorts of catasqc.

"Banhishikha”, “P. W. D.”, “Ritimata‘
Natak”, ‘ Ajkal”, “Bish Bachar Agey”,
» and the following artists have gathered fame in acting in the above
mentioned dramas—Reena Dutta,
Khuku Dutta, Anjali Mukherjee. Mati
Das, Rashbehari Das, S. Roy Choudhury, Shanti Dutta, Dipak Sarkar,
Sadhan Bhattacharjee, Jagadish Bhattacharjee,

late Haran Chandra Mu-

kherjee, Satyajyoti Chakravarti, Gopal Nath, P. N. Mukherjee, etc.
To me Khuku Dutta, Reena Dutta.

P. N. Mukherjee, Sadhan Bhattacharjee and Gopal Nath are having rare
talents which can make them the
most successful artists, if properly
guided and taught the technical sides
of acting.
