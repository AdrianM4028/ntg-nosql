I styles of delivery.
The conventions of speech are
further complicated by interweaving
the dialogues ‘ of the actors with the
narrative sung by the Chorus. The
Chorus occasionally recite and sing
the dramatic dialogues of the various
charaters as well.
This function of
the chorus gives relief to the actor
from singing and he utilizes it for
interpreting the text in highly stylised
gestures and movements.

THEATRE

THEATRE ARCHITECTURE
Whether it is a simple platformstage or the level-ground acting area
used for a large variety of Asian
plays or the highly specialised and
elaborate stages for the presentation
of Noh and Kabuki plays, the theatre
architecture in Asian tradition has a
ﬂexible character and gives maximum

scope to the actor’s art and helps in
creating closer ties between the actors
and audience. Kabuki of Japan provides hanamichi—a ‘ raised platform
running through the auditorium—for
the enactment of certain scenes and
some of the action of the drama ; and
in the Leela plays of India, sum of
the action is enacted in the midst of
the audience.
Even in the secular
drama of lighter variety, passages
and corridors are created running
through the audience which are used
as secondary acting areas. The Noh
stage is built out into the auditorium
so that the audience actually sit on
two sides of it.
Flexibility of the
theatre is further exploited through
' many devices, such as the projection

of stage, creation of several levels and
acting areas on the stage and relating
the off-stage action to the onestage
action through the actor’s speeches.
