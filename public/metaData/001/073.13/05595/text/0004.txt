'

I am glad to know that the Theatre Centre. Manipur, is organising
All Manipur Theatre Conference to evaluate the existing situation and
to
give further ﬁllip to their theatre movement. Theatre has always been in
our society a very important element of our culture and as such I attach
great importance to the development of the theatre in different regionsManipur is known for its rich artistic traditions. The graceful and lyrical
Manipuri dance is internationally known. The traditional theatre Jatra
has also deep roots in the artistic and cultural life of the people.
I send my good wishes and felicitations on this occasion and wish the
Theatre Conference a great success.
