possible scenario for us. And to get there we need to move in exactly
opposite direction to the one we are being enticed to move in. "
"

Remember Gandhi had said over half a century ago that :"I must notfear if the world is going in the wrong it direction and like
the proverbial moth burns itself eventually in the ﬂame around which it
dances more and more ﬁercely. It is boundenduty to my last breath. to try

and protect India and through India the entire world from such a doom. "
For Bapu knew that his new education his ‘Nai ’I‘aleem’... "will provide a
healthy and moral basis of relationship between the city and the village
and thus go a long way towards eradicating some of the worst evils of the
present social insecurity that has poisoned the relationship between the
classes. It will check the progressive decay of our villages and lay the
foundation of a juster social order in which there is no unnatural division
between the haves and the have-nots and every-body is assured of a living
wage and realfreeclom. ’
This then was the message that I wanted to share with the youth of Avikal with the 1 _

youth of Dehradun and the youth all over the world. Think. . . . think twice about all that
we assume. about all we believe to be true for then the words (if General Douglas Mac
Arthur will become clear to us.. "in the evolution of civilisation if it is to survive. all
men cannot fail eventually to adopt his beliefs". This then was my tribute to Gandhi and
my message to Avikal.
"Sandeep Singh Batu is presently running Susuwa "an Initiative for Holistic
Development" on the periphery of Raja jee National Park, village Dooth. "
