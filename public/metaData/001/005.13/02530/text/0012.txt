Anita 15th . Jan.
As the quiet night passes by
And the dawn breaks,

With the sun rising up from behind the mountains
Glittering its light upon nature,
The curiosity to reach the sacred place increases.
The place where no one is someone,
Where there is no boss and no clerk,

. Where we are all one
And only one
Working together to know and dig out something
Which no one has done or achieved before.
Sandeep K. 16th. ofJan
We heard the script, it was very nice. We were all very happy with the play and

had become more enthusiastic about it. I think everyone was determined to produce
something which would make a strong impact.
