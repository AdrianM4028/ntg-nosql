A Message from Sadhana Ulfat
Our body is a vehicle in which we carry our hopes and wishes, desire
and passion, antipathy and sympathy, an ever active mind, a throbing heart,
ever contracting and expanding lungs," self, selflessness' and selfishness and

including all that which we call ATMA.

'

Our senses stand at the threshold of the known and the unknown. A
weak body, unhealthy senses and a sick mind does not allow the soul to
evolve.
Among the many tasks of education the most important are to sharpen
the faculty of senses, to help the individual to have a complete experience, .
to develop curiosity, physical abilities, a sensitive outlook to life, an ability to

differentiate between things and to make right choices.

рей

Physical death is as certain as our birth; our memory must fail, our body
disintegrate and "our wishes expand into the cosmos, realized and unrealized.
in the ever changing and dying physical world the soul is eternal and com-

plete. The task of education is to nourish the soul. Our clever plans and
sympathetic mind are not enough to save the earth. The problem of the
environment have become soul size and now we need to evolve our soul to
save and restore the environment. Earth is truly a mother who provides .for
us all and will continue to provide, DUt only if she lives?
