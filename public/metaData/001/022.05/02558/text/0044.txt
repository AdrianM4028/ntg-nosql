There is a paradox here which can only be understood by realising that

Shaw’s own “naive feelings“ were dominated by a passionate desire to
understand, to be intellectually in control of feeling, laughter,
happiness,

as well as argument.

He wanted a drama that

and

reflected his

own sense of being most alive when in pursuit of some idea or action
in which he could have absolute faith. In this he was a resolute romantic,
a writer in quest of some secret that was always eluding him. Many of his
characters express such an involvement directly:
Everything I think is mocked by everything I do.
ARMS AND THE MAN
I think I'm going to die for God.
to die for.

Nothing else is real enough

… What is God? … When we know that, Captain,

we

shall be gods ourselves.
ANDROCLES AND THE LION
What is life but a series of inspired follies?
is to find them to do.
PYGMALION

The difficulty

I'm always expecting something. I don‘t know what it is; but
life must come to a point sometimes.
HEARTBREAK HOUSE
Underlying the plays, in all their fantasies, jokes, surprises, provocations
and serious arguments, is their author‘s p ssionate insecurity, his unfulfilled
desire to understand the whole business and absurdity of life around him, to
know what it is like to see with each person's eyes and feel with each person's
senses and intelligence. Bernard Shaw dramsaudiences into theatres because he
shares the exhilaration of his own endless passion to understand.

Abridged and adapted from a prefatory essay
to a new student's edition of Shaw‘s plays
that is being published by Longmans; reprinted
