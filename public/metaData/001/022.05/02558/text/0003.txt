BERNARD SHAW
Bernard Shaw was born in Dublin on 26 July
1856, the third and last child — and only son —
of George Carr Shaw, a civil servant, and his wife

Lucinda. At an early age he was educated by a
clerical uncle who was Vicar of St Brides, Dublin

and later at a Wesleyan Connexional School.
In 1871 he joined the land agency as a clerk in

Dublin and subsequently moved to London in 1876.
Between 1879 and 1883 he wrote five novels,
four of which were subsequently published. In
1885 he joined the reviewing staff of The Pall

Mall Gazette and the following year became art
critic for The World. From 1888 until 1890
he contributed music criticism to The Star as
‘Corno di Bassetto’ later becoming music critic

for The World and drama critic for The Saturday
Review.

His first play, WIDOWERS’ HOUSES, was
produced in 1892 having been started seven years
earlier. The main popularity of his plays,
however, dates from the Court Theatre repertory
season under Granville-Barker and Vedrenne.
Between 1904 and 1907, seven hundred and
one performances were given of eleven of his

plays. Included in this season was GranvilleBarker’s production of CANDIDA in which Kate

Rorke played the title role.
In all he wrote over fifty plays of which the best-

known are probably: MAN AND SUPERMAN,
ARMS AND THE MAN, BACK TO METHUSEIAH,
PYGMALION, MAJOR BARBARA, CAESAR
AND CLEOPATRA, HEARTBREAK HOUSE,
YOU NEVER CAN TELL, THE DOCTOR’S
DILEMMA and ST JOAN. His film association
with Gabriel Pascal in screen adaptations of

PYGMALION, MAJOR BARBARA and CAESAR
AND CLEOPATRA also brought his works to a
wider public.

He died on 2nd November 1950 at Ayot St Lawrence
in Hertfordshire in the house which had been his

home for many years and is now maintained by
the National Trust.
