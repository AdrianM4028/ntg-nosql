EARLIER PRODUCTIONS OF CANDIDA
Written'in 1894, CANDIDA was Shaw’s fifth play
— following WIDOWERS’ HOUSES, THE
PHILANDERER, ARMS AND THE MAN and
MRS WARREN’ S PROFESSION. Prior to its first
public performance in 1897, the play was given a
performance to establish copyright at the Theatre

Charles Carrington as Morell; Courtney Thorpe
(Marchbanks); Lionel Belmore (Burgess); Robert

Farquharson (Lexy) and Edith Craig as Proserpine.
The cast (with the exception of Granville Barker

who played Marchbanks) remained the same for
the first performance given in London by The

रैहुँठेंद्धृष्ट Society at the Strand Theatre on July lst

CANDIDA has since been revived in London on

a number of occasions. In 1920 Sybil Thorndike
played in a production at the Holborn Empire
and in 1937 the role of Candida was taken at the

Globe Theatre by Ann Harding who was followed
in the production by Diana Wynyard. The 1947
revival at the Piccadilly saw Fay Compton in the
title role and Jack Hawkins as Morell. The last
London production in 1977 was at the Albery

Theatre and was directed by Michael Blakemore.
Deborah Kerr played Candida with Denis Quilley
