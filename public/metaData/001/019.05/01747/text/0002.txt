The Troupe
The Departmental Drama Troupe of the Song and Drama Division came into existence seven years ago and its
performances are not new to Delhi audiences. The Troupe stages plays only in Hindi.

Its performances have been equally appreciated in other parts of India.

Particular mention may be made of the

Troupe’s visit to the South and more recently to Rajasthan when its performances won laurels from the press and public
alike. The Troupe has so far presented more than five hundred performances in various parts of the country.

The Play

The play depicts a day in the life of inhabitants of the North Eastern parts of India in an hour of crisis, and
through the image strives to focus light on the valiant resistance movement organised against the Chinese aggressors
by a handful of these vanguards who stand as watch-dogs of the freedom of our motherland on the north eastern
borders.

The narrative achieves an extra dimension as the author weaves, in the colourful fabric of the life of these simple
folk, sufﬁcient motifs and symbols which give us the privilege to see through them a people desperately moving

towards mature and adult preferences in their attachment and kinship.
In the ﬁnal moment of blowing up of the linking bridge and self-imposed martyrdom of local leaders, a ritual is
performed through which the small society emerges puriﬁed of its taint of the alien intervention in their life.

The tragedy brings to focus a close-up ofa small section of a community which is Indian ﬁrst and Indian last and
through the same token spotlights a picture of a mature, adult and up-coming nation.
