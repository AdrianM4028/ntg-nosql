Synopsis of the Play
‘ SHIJA LAIOIBI ’

The action commences when Bhaigyachandra Maharaj of Manipur got defeated at
the hands of the Burmese in 1759 A.D. He escaped to Tekhao (the modern Sibsagar) where
the king of that place (Rajeshwar) kept him in his palace withdue regard and
honour.
Bhaigyachandra known as Karta had to catch a wild elephant in order to
prove his
identity before the people of Tekhao. The king overwhelmed with sorrow and
grief lay
asleep and in his dream came Lord Krishna and gave him divine instructions. Accordi
ngly
Karta Maharaj caught the wild elephant.
Karta Maharaj (Bhaigyachandra) returned to Manipur and with the help of the hill
and valley people he completely defeated the Burmese and ascended the throne
of Manipur.
The story centres round the life of his daughter Shija later known as Shija
Laioibi.
In 1776 Bhaigyachandra installed the image of Lord Shree Shree Govind
ajee according to
the idea revealed to him in his dream. He then organised Rash Leela for
the ﬁrst time in
Manipur in which his Virgin daughter Shija taking the role of Radhi
ka played with Lord
Krishna being represented by the image. Thereafter she was known as SHIJA
LAIOIBI.

Shija then took Anuprabhu to Nabadwip the birth place
of Lord Gauranga and
devoted the rest of her life in the service of the Lord until
one day she lost herself in the temple of Anuprabhu. Thus Shija dedicated her life and soul to
Lord Krishna and her life

became an embodiment of devotion, piety and love.
