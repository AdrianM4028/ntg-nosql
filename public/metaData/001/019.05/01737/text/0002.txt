Act I: Appasaheb Barve, a Government Ofﬁcer in his 5 years is a scrupulous, punctual man, leads his life
happily with his beautiful wife and two brilliant children. One ﬁne evening he comes across a handsome Kashmiri
youth named Samsher, who pretends to be a Police Ofﬁcer and tries to blackmail him. Appasaheb had
unintentionally committed an error some twenty-seven years back. Samsher tries to exploit that incident
and demands thirty thousand Rupees from Appasaheb.
The latter asks him to come next day.
Meanwhile, one
Garge, his son’s friend, keeps with his own detective novel. Garge wants Appasaheb to use his inﬂuence
to get the novel published. Appasaheb casually goes through that suspense novel and ﬁnds a solution
to his problem] He plans to murder Samsher Singh next day in the same manner a murderer kills a man in that

book.
Act II: Next evening, Samsher comes back to take from Appasaheb thirty thousand Rupees in cash. Appasaheb puts poison in a cup of tea and offers it to Samsher. But the scrupulous man that he is, he prevents Samsher

from drinking that tea at the last moment. However, to his utter surprise, Samsher collapses before his lips touch the
cup of tea and dies on the spot.
Act III : Police Inspector, Mohite, the family friend of Appasaheb Barve, unfolds the mystery.
Samsher was not a police oﬂ‘lcer.
He had robbed some documents from the police ﬁle and tried to blackmail two

victim of Sarnsher’s blackmail had poisoned Samsher. Appasaheb is found to be non-guilty in the whole episode.
