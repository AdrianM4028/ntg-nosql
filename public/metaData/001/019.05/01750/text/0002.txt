The Troupe

V

The Departmental Drama Troupe of the Song and Drama Division came into existen
ce
eight years ago and its performances are not new to Delhi audience. The Troupe stages
plays
only in Hindi.
Its performances have been equally appreciated in other parts of India. Particular
mention may be made of the Troupe’s visit to the South and more recently to Rajast
han when
its performances won laurels from the press and public alike. The Troupe has so far
presented
more than six hundred performances in various parts of the country.
The Play

Koh-e-noor Ka Lutera has the background of Nadirshah’s invasion of India, his
Victory
in the battle of Karnal, his eventual arrival at Delhi as a victor and the
loss to India of the
famous diamond ‘KOH-E-NOOR’.

The characters in the play are, by and large, common people whose lot was
to bear the
brunt of the consequences but who had hardly anything to do with the shapin
g of the events.
The play opens with an archaeologist curiously examining an incomplete
statue.

He

is wondering about it and as if to solve the mystery, the statue
narrates its own tale, of

an age coloured with the blood of hundreds of Indians and crowned with
an ignominous
defeat—the tale of Nadirshah’s invasions of Delhi and the general massacre.
