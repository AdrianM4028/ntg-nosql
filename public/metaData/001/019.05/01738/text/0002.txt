MAHUA
At the foot of the eastern Himalayas, just ahead the Gare-hills in the district of Mymensingh—a tribal clan headed by Hoomra Sardar made their abode. One night, when they came
to a village named Kanchanpur, Hoomra, the Sardar of the band, kidnapped a sweet little

Brahmin girl of the village and ﬂed away with his party. During the 16 years’ span of time,
Hoomra with heart of a father, brought her up to blooming youthful girl and also trained her
up at his own choice to an excellent Bedini-dancer with exquisite art of enchanting all sorts of
spectators of the places they used to visit. Hoomra named her ——MAHUA— beautiful and
charming Mahua—cynosure of the party personnel.
One day, Hoomra with Mahua, Palang Soi, Sujan, Manik etc. comes to Bamankanda

village and gave performances of their feats before the young Brahmin Zemindar of the place,
Naderchand Thakur.
Mahua noticing the handsome young Zemindar, starts dancing
with her charming look askance towards him and shows her feats to excellence and wondrous
display of snake charming. Eyes meet with eyes, both become target to Cupid’s arrow.
Naderchand smitten with love for Mahua, leaves home in search of his sweetheart

Mahua and after a strenuous travel in the wilderness meets her in Hoomra’s newly pitched

camp.
Unrelenting and revengeful Sardar drags Mahua from her lover’s protection and
compels her to make an end of the life of her lover Naderchand with poison dagger while
displaying a dance before him. Mahua under the pretext of welcoming the proposal, takes up
the dagger, starts a maddening dance but at long last, strikes deep the dagger in her own
bosom.

She dies a martyr to the dictum “Amor Vincit Omnia”.
