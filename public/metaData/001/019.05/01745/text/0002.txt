Synopsis of the play
‘ AG AMANI ’
The play opens with Kali Talukdar alias Kaloo, a notorious Goonda. He was not a
born Goonda. It is the circumstances, the anti-social elements dressed as respectable citizens
like Nityanand Baruah, Dr. Das and their associates who make criminals out of normal healthy
citizens.

The story unfolds in two acts with Kaloo presenting the life he had been compelled to
lead—adulteration of food, hoarding and black marketing organised by Nityanand Baruah, the
novel methods acquired by Dr. Das and the attempts ofKaloo to take revenge for the death of his
sister and father. In order to save his skin Nityanand Baruah manages to send him tojail twice.

Having taken to pick-pocketing Kaloo awaits his turn for revenge. But every time the
daughter of Nityanand Baruah ‘Agamani’ by name, reminds him of his dead sister thus deterring
him at the nick of time from contemplated murder. But ultimately efforts of Kaloo to expose
the anti-social elements do ﬁnd roots in the minds of people around him. It is particularly
moving because he ﬁnds Agamani on his side opposed to her father. Agamani is instrumental
in preventing her father’s murder at the hands of Kaloo but therein probably lies the pointer of
the play, the literal meaning of the word ‘Agamani’—Things to come.
