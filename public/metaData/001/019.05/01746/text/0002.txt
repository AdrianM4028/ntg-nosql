The Troupe

The Departmental Drama Troupe of the Song and Drama Division came into existence
eight years ago and its performances are not new to Delhi audience. The Troupe stages plays
only in Hindi.

Its performances have been equally appreciated in other parts of India. Particular
mention may be made of the Troupe’s visit to the South and more recently to Rajasthan when
its performances won laurels from the press and public alike. The Troupe has so far presented
more than ﬁve hundred performances in various parts of the country.

The Play
The play takes you to a Dharamshala in Kashi where three families, from different
regions of India are occupying the adjacent rooms. Like many of us, they criticise the other
behind his back not for anything important but for petty superﬂuous things which have no
bearing either on human dignity or character. Still the criticism against the man from the
other regions fervently goes on.

And yet in the face of a common danger, they seem to forget all prejudices and rush out
to help the distressed.
One wonders why Chatterjees, Chaddhas and Chettiars of today endeavour to live in
water-tight compartments which in any case they cannot.
