Synopsis of the play
AGNIPU'I‘RI

Prof. Rajan meets Sindhu at the rescue shelter and develops a fascination for her. They
get married. Rajan happens to be the second sibling of a big family, his elder brother
Jayan
being a doctor. He has married Sandhya, daughter of a high oﬂ‘icer. Rajan comes
home
with Sindhu. His father’s octogenarian mother, his own mother, and ‘Bindhu’, the apple
of
everybody’s eye—these are the other members of the household. Rajan’s wedlock does
not
meet with the approval of anybody, but ‘Bindhu’, somehow,

takes a liking for her new

sister-in-law. Sindhu gets a shock when she realises the type of the family set-up into
which
destiny has thrown her. It is the doctor who gets on respectably, that has ﬁrst led her
astray.
The sprightly ‘Bindhu’ is the doctor’s child by ‘Sindhu’. But the poor child is under
the belief
that her mother is no more.

Balan, son of Prof. Rajan’s uncle, is an engineer and Rajan’s age-

old friend. He was for some time employed in their own place. Balan, however,
left for
Persia when he got a more decent salary and better prospects. He has now come
back from
Persia. He does not imagine it to be a crime to marry a girl of the rescue
shelter. But on
seeing Sindhu, he changes his views. Sindhu had lived with Balan for a couple
of years under
the name Pushpa. The scandal-ridden family atmosphere gets tense. Secrets
are out, one by
one. Despite the thorough exposure of all secrecy and the culprits’ confessions,
Rajan is not
prepared to abandon Sindhu. The story ends with the collapse of Sindhu on
the ﬁfth day of
her arrival in that house, under the heavy repercussions of her idealistic love.
