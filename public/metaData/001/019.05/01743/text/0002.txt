The Play
Sasti is a dramatisation of Shri Kanhu Charan Mohanti’s novel of the same name. The dramatisation has tried to reﬂect the authentic picture of the cultural life of the folks through songs, dances and
drama.

The play is a depiction of human endurance and basic emotions in the face of the worst famine

of 1866.

Sania is treated as an outcast by the Village head Chintei Swain and is harassed by his men just
because in the years of famine he had taken food with other victims of the famine. Dhobi, widowed
daughter of the village-head is the only sympathiser. She secretly helps Sania to establish himself again
in the village much against the wishes of her father and the villagepriest.

Dhobi has to decline an offer

of re-marriage with Sania because of the social barriers. Sania takes a cue from the moral courage of
Dhobi and decides to dedicate his life to serve the suffering humanity. After the death of Dhobi’s
mother, her father agrees to re-marry his daughter to Sania, but it is too late because Sania is with all
the refugees in quest of such a society where humanity is the only religion and man is the only race.
