SHA'I‘ABDIR SADHANA
The subject matter on which this Dance-Drama is based describes both the internal and
external manifestation of the penance for the liberation of our country and the great struggle
we had to undergo to win the freedom by waging a ceaseless war.
It contains a brief history for about a century from 1857 to 1947 A.D. depicting many
touching events of incredible sacriﬁce. The self-immolation of the chivalrous Mangal Pande;
the heroism of Nana Sahib the ruler of Bithur; the self-sacriﬁce of the great hero Tantia Topie;

the unprecedented chivalry of the heroic lady the V Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, have all
constituted the priceless treasure of our national life. Thereafter has emerged the Indian
National Congress which roused in the heart of the people the awakening and the aspiration
for the acquisition of freedom. There came about the agitation for the partition of Bengal.
With it the atrocious persecution and incarceration of the British began. There happened the
gruesome and relentless massacre ofJalianwala Bagh to which the Rowlatt Act bears its abominable testimony. Then came the Non-cooperation Movement. In this struggle Mahatma
Gandhi came in forefront of the nation. It is his clarion call that led the nation to the Civil
Disobedience Movement. In 1942 he inspired the nation to the dictum ‘Karenga Yea
Marengay’ i.e. ‘Do or die’ ‘Quit India’ the directive of the Indian Nation as a, whole was
brought home to the British. During this time of the World War II Netaji Subhas Chandra
Bose formed his Azad Hind Army in Burma. That is also a glorious chapter in the history of
India’s struggle for freedom. At the end of World War II India attains her freedom on 15th
August 1947रे
Let us offer our obeisance to the myriads of martyrs who have won our freedom by self-

immolation and have made gift thereof to us on the 15th August, 1947-
