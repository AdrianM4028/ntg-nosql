Working with Adivasis has not been a new thing for me.

I have earlier

written and directed two plays ‘Katha Kaal Akaal Ki' and ‘Hatyara Thain Ho’
with ३ the Adivasis of Kavita and Jhadol village respectively under the aegis
of Seva Mandir. Both these musical plays incorporated the folk elements of
lacal dance drama form ‘Gavri'. The success of my earlier endeavour can be
gauged by the 45 hit shows of ‘Katha Kaal Akaal Ki’ staged in diﬁerent
villages and townships of Rajasthan.

So, when Seva Mandir and WZCC decided to jointly organise a tribal
drama workshop at the village Khaliya and Mrs. Aditi Mehta, the Director
of W.Z.C.C. asked me to take up this workshop I was thrilled at the prospect
of working with the Adivasis once again. For me, working with them has

always been exciting as their natural gift of dance and rhythm lends a new
dimension to the dramatic idiom. Improvisations being natural to tribals one
never ﬁnds their performances becoming stale.

In this workshop, I was confronted with a tremendous challange as the
group I was workinggwith, had no previous exposure to drama and acting.
In the wake of this, directing the play with them became all the more diﬂ’icult,
Albeit, they were inexperienced, they were a devoted and dedicated lot replete
with ‘espirit de corps' and very keen and enthusiastic to learn.

I have evolved thetheme of this play'in the workshop itself', weaving-it
around the social, political and economic problems of the. Adivasis. I am ’
extremely grateful to the staff of Seva Mandir and my collegues from the .
Centre for the help they have extended to me in making this workshop a
success.
Before you is the result of 45 days of our intense working.

you will enjoy the show.
