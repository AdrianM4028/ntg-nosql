Rajasthan has a great tradition of visual and
performing arts. Miniatufé painting, architecture

and the music from Ralasthah have already been
acknowledged

thrdUghout

the

world.

But,

unfortunately, the théhtrical traditions have not
yet found their right fullplace in the history of
Indian art.
Folk traditions are eroded by the influence of
commercial cinema, This is a high time that
the people concerned with cultUre and art
pay an urgent attention to the dying and eroded
traditiOns. It will not be enough to document
them for the posterity or create a 200 for them
It is important that the contemporary artists
have a living dialogue and interaction with the
vibrant folk traditions to create a new artistic
reality which will not only have its cultural
re|evance to us, but also will have an identity
of its own. Universality does not mean or amount
to loss of individual or cultural identity.
AAJ has always aimed at this interaction bet—
ween the present and the past for the creation
of a new future, And it is therefore that we
take proud in presenting ”KAL—KATHA" which
is a recent document of our above stated
objective. In ”Kai—Katha" Shri Bhanu Bharti, a
well known theatre director of the country, has
tried to tackle a human situation from the universal view point in a given situation of a tribal
community and its performing traditions. After
an interaction for almost five years with the
Bheels in the Mewar—region, Shri Bharti has been
able to evolve a theatrical idiom which is very
fresh but has its bearings in an aboriginal
tradition.
AAJ has produced this play in collaboration
with Disha Natya Sanstha of Udaipur. This is
the first effort of AAJ in the field of theatre,
and we hope that it will generate a genuine
appreciation among the patrons of AAJ and
the theatre lovers all over the country.
