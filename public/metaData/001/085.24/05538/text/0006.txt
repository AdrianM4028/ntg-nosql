A Scene from rehearsal

Scene— 70.
In the jungle Gauri in the garb of Goma, the
bandit chief, falls asleep and is awaken by a
woman, who claims to be the wife of Goma. The
woman shows her wonder at his reluctance and
informs that she saw a dead body surrounded
by female clothes in the forest, badly moulded
by some beast. Gauri is relieved by the news as

she takes the body to be of Goma's. She thinks
herself to be free to assume and live the role of
bandit chief. The woman wants Gauri to accom—
pany her to their home, to which Gauri agrees
on the condition that she will not touch the
woman until the drought IS over. The pretext
she puts forward is that she has taken a vow

before the Goddess, whom she met in the jungle.

Scene— 7 7 .
The singer watches them leaving together and
wonders what will become of Gauri in the garb
of Goma. He also wonders about the woman

who is now Gauri's companion. He decides to
become a tree and have a closer look.
Gauri enters practising shoot'ng of arrows. She
learns skills fast but only through the clever
prompting from her woman companion . That's
how she is alSo accepted as Goma by the other
bandits. The singer is amazed, but he wonders
if Gauri will be proved another Goma.
