the lot of prostitutes.

When they find that their tender feelings and delicate emotions are
brutally squashed, they in turn. commercialise all their feelings, all their desires.

While restructuring this play-while giving it at full body and shape-we drew inspiration from
Sanskrit fiction and Sanskrit drama and by keeping in View all the salient features of Sanskrit
play, we almost rewrote the entire script. We had to do it because we wanted to meke room

‘dated' and stale.

i have kept my vision clear, without falling a prey to any preoccupied notion or prejudice,
and have taken all liberties with the script and discovered some points where new situation
and innovative happenings could be included.
i myself and all my associates are committed tolmake efforts so that this play may turned

out to do he a delightful experience but besides providing pleasure if this play succeeds in
making even small dents in the hearts and minds of the theatre-goers then I would consider
my venture meaningful.
