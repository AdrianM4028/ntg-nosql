makes me interested in the ‘Way’ of saying things, rather than ‘what’ is being said.
Primarily
it also involves grappling with the potential inherent in the dramatic medium of the play itself.
Besides, the script also tests my ability to help mould a dramatic work from scretch. What
appeals to me about the play is it vitality and frankness. The play has a documentary quality
Without being over explicit. The play is modest, unpretentious and preaches no ideology as to

how the situation could be amended.

The characters are well sketched though not ever

detailed, but deﬁnately very real.
Another challenge offered by the play is that it is conceived in episodes and not acts. For
treatment of this scenic or episodic approach to the structure of the play. I will bank on my
experience of direction and study of forms be it either Greek, Brecht or traditional, to derive a
theatre idiom.

I am conﬁdent that I will explore the possibility of this approach fruitfully.

To a large extent

I conceive the play cinematically. I feel the play of this stature must have the editing speed
and agility of ﬁlm, Several techniques which are the theatrical counterpart of cutting superirns
posing or dissolving will be evolved. Baradi narrates a modern lable, his immaculate sense of
poetic justice, his use of song from old Gujarati 'plays and their rendering will act as vital

points in the play presentation.
