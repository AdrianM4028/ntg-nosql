the necessary evils of the life of a prostitute.

There is beauty and the saphisticated user of

beauty, the pros nourish some unexpressed and hidden desires for someone, there is love,
there is body, and the desires of the body. A lot of laughter is there, there are quarrels,
scuﬂles, there is pimp business, eroticism and youthful excitement, But among all these
situations, hate plays its own role, the sorrow of the fading youth and there is despise born
out of the continuous dislike for the existence which compells them to remain merely as

commodities, as the objects of exploitation and none else.
