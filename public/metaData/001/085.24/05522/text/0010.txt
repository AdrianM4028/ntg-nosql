example the eruption of revolution when the basic rights of human beings and his beingners
are depressed.

I give more importance to the revolution, its strength and its philosophy and have made
use of the original script just as an example. In my View the mythological story from
original script is not that important and because of that I have omitted some sceanes some

mythological references and likewise some characters. (In the scenewise synopsis I have put
into the brackets the story which I want to refer) I think this change is necessary and is

more appropriate for Artistic purpose and for presentation of my View. In the same way in
order not to stick to the peculier Traditional images of mythological charactots and to make
them flexible, I have made a sincere effort to present it in a new way of style through the

media of Dance, Music, Light. costumes and Acting.
