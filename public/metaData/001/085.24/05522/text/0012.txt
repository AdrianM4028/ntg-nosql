The brief story of ‘LA'I’AKPVIELKAM’ revolves round its protagonist a prostitute, named Madam
Maniari. The rich and the opulent class of the town indulge in all sorts of, pranks to obtain
the amorous favours of this coveten prostitute. Although the men projected here, belong to
the diﬁerent stratas of the

society but the face of their desire is the same.

Together, they

all present a monolithic physicality.
