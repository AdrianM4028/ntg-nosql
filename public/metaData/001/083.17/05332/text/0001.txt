The Production

Style at

Bhasa’s KARNA-BHARA :

Of the ten major types of Sanskrit plays
does Karna-Bhara by Bhasa belong to the
Ut‘shrushtrkanka variety? In other words, is

it a complete play in its own rights? or. is it a
part of a . larger. drama of Samavakara type?
RANGA—BIJA tries to find an answer. to this
controversy on the experience of producing

this play. '
In the first phase of this project; assumption

is that it is an Anka with Karuna as its pradhana Rasa, strongly supported - by ViraRasa (Dana Vira.) as its gauna rasa.

The second phase of this project
devoted to the prodUction based

will be
on the

assumption that its pradhana‘Rasa is Vira;

and it .‘is a part of a Samavakara.
This is ३ a Natyadharjmi

lining its
Pravr‘itti.
