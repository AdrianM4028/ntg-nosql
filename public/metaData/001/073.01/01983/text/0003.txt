duryodhana the epitome of-ego, takes it up with 'gandhari’-— on learning
the truth, he holds grand father gandharasena responsible for his tainted birth
and decides to anihilate his entire family— this he does by imprisoning them
rina carefully plotted ‘move— unfed, all the sons of gandharasena die,
excepting s a kun i —sakuni survives and takes an oath before the dying father to
duryodhana by introducing them to the intoxicating game of dice—

destroy

the director speaks.- i deliberately selected this from the mythology
because i felt i would provide the basic structure in a contemporary mould
along with elements of t1ad1t1onal pe1forrnanccs weavedin to it

i chose the essence of 'chhow' & other martial art forms of orissa for the
movements and the speech pattern was derived from our traditional
‘gitinatya’— for the 'sutradhara' the basic style of rendering was taken from
'pala' & 'daskathia', which most suited the character

with all these elements blended together, i hope to have produced a style of
my own in presenting ‘jhimiti khela'

-

‘

another aspect of the play which 1' have tried to emphasise is how this great
war was caused only due to personal ego & jea'lousies— this. as i see. holds
good even in the contemporary society and is a omen of destruction
