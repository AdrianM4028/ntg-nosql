about ourselves : since our inception in ‘83/‘84. we have faced many a ups
8८ downs— some expected and some not— some years have been hectic with

productions and some laden with silence — with agony & exasperation —
yet we have survived, instinctively -- all the time hoping, re—thinking and
ever believing in ‘theatre'-— and again after 11, years we put on our make—up
& constumes to go on stage with our 8th play ”Jhimiti Khela" a prime
episode drawn from the timeless epic ‘Mahabharata’ —this is being presented
with a 'traditional' तो 'folk' flavour within a contemporary structure—we hope
you enjoy it !

“jhimiti khela” : 'Lord Ganesh' transcribed as 'Vyasadeva' narrated the
immortal epic of 'Mahabharta’—- by? far the largest and most complex of epics
written in the entire history of mankind, this epic presents human nature, it's
complex psyche in a spell binding totality—the intricacies of human relation—
ship, the personal ego & identity crisis, all portrayed with convincing
authority— sub—stories of valour & cowardice, love तो hate, good & evil,
justice 8८ injustice, abound in 'Mahabharata’ with a definite religious motif—
told via innumerable characters, each different from the other, with such
passion that can only celebrate ‘life'—- life as it should be
our, play is a fraction of the ‘adya parba’ (prologue) of ‘Mahabharata' which
explains some of the basic causes leading to the great war— duryodhana's
ego kept on increasing the differences between the kourava&pandava
princes— worried with the growing animosity between them, raja
dhritarashtra cleverly, decided to reinstate the pandavas in indraprastha

one day in the 'raj sabha‘ duryodhana openly insults‘ all the pandava princes
elaborating their actual parantage—

this insult, subsequently is returned by bhima under Lord Krishna's counsel,
again doubting the parentage of duryodhana
