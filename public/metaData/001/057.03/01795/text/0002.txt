N ATY A SA M A R0 H ’ 86

This is the third Natya Samaroh in Delhi, an annual
all-India festival of experimental plays presented by
Sangeet Natak Akademi. The festival is the product of
SNA‘s Scheme of Assistance to Young Theatre
Workers, a scheme launched in ‘84 to support the
efforts of young directors in quest of an indigenous
theatre idiom, inspired by the traditional/folk theatre of
the country. SNA holds four zonal festivals annually,
substantially aiding the productions mounted.
Selections from the zonal festivals feature in the allIndia festival in Delhi.
Twelve zonal festivals have been held in the past
three years —— in Bangalore, Cochin, Mysore (South
Zone), Bhubaneswar, Calcutta, Guwahati (East Zone),

Lucknow, Chandigarh, Kurukshetra (North Zone), Goa,
Udaipur and Nagpur (West Zone). These have been
presented in collaboration with the State Sangeet Natak ‘
Akademis and Departments of Culture.
