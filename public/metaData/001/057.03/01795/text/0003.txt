Director’s Note

The theatre idiom used is based on the narrative structure of
Pena singing with a blend of the balladic Khongjam Parva style
and'expressional devices from Nata Sankirtan. Lai-Haraoba
and other traditional Manipuri arts. Emphasis in this
production has been laid on stylistic movement with minimal

use of music.
