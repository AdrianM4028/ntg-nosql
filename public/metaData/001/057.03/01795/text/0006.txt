MA RATTAM
(Malayalam)
Produced by: Thirnottam. Trivandrurn. Kerala
Written by: Kavalam Narayana Panikkar
Directed by: MS. Satheesh

Synopsis
The three principal characters in the play are Koippattari, his

wife Kavooty Amma and Kelu. a Kathakali actor. Kelu is an
unnattractive man but in the role of Keechaka is the very
embodiment of love. Kavooty Amma loves l<elu as Keechaka
but dislikes the actor as a man. On the other hand Koippattari.
her husband — a Kathakali connoisseur — admires Kelu for
his art but abhors him in the Keechaka role when he finds his
wife drawn to the mythic character. The conflict that grows
between the three is the clash of illusion and reality, finally
resolved when Kavooty Amma is able to distinguish one from
the other.

Director’s Note

The production uses the motifs of Kathakali and other
indigenous performances. The theme is the transformation of
Kavooty Amma, the heroine … a change of perception
wrought by the cleverly designed action of the play.
