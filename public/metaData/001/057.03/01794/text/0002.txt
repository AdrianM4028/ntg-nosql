Susta river in its zig zag course passes through Barich, a village in
Hyderabad. Hundred and ﬁfty stone steps above the banks of this river stands
a lonely marble palace.
Around it there is no habitation. the village and
cotton mart of Barich being too far away to disturb its solitude.
This palace was built about 250 years ago by the Emperor Mohmud
Shah ll as a seraglio for his pleasure and indulgence. Once jets of rose water
spurted from its fountains. And on the marble seats around these fountains
sat and sang pretty damsels of Persia who were brought there against their will
for a moment’s pleasure of the Emperor. only to be consigned to the dark
dungeons at his whims. While the corridors of this palace were filled with
the strains of music and the tinkling of anklets its dark recesses had witnessed
the sighs and agonies of many a hapless victim condemned to doom.
Now the fountains are silent. Music no more ﬁlls its corridors. The
marble floors no more feel the touch of gentle feet. The curses of all whose
cries were stiffled within the walls have made every stone of this palace thirsty
and hungry, eager to swallow like a famished ogress any one approaching it.
Not one of those who lived there could escape this fate save Meher Ali who
had survived only at the cost of his reason... He roams about the corridors
crying HAll is false”—“All is false”. This desolate palace is now the residence
of Nizam’s cess collectors. And it falls to a cess collector, young and
lonely, to lift a corner of the dark curtain that separates the past from the
present.
