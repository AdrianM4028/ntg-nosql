The Little Ballet Troupe
The Little Ballet Troupe was founded in January I952 under the guidance
of the late Shanti Bardhan. The formation as well as the name owed not a
little to the freshness of vision and the bold spirit of experimentation which
had characterised Shanti Bardhan’s work all through his life. He and his
colleagues had realised that ballet, if it was to take its proper place in the life
of the people, would have to draw inspiration mainly from folk traditions. The
Troupe embodied a radical spirit of approach to ballet, which was visualised as
a symbol of the highest degree of co-ordination and integration for a collective artistic purpose. Also it recognised that the Indian tradition of folk
drama and the contemporary state of theatre in India, both demanded that
mere extravagance of showrnanship should be replaced by the economy
characteristic of a true expression of creative genius.
The Troupe began to function as a centre of training in the theatre arts
especially dance, music and decor, in addition to its work as a performing
professional company maintaining high standards.
The present repertory of the Troupe consists of four full-length
ballets and a variety of shorter dance numbers which can be presented
independently or in conjunction with the ballets.
The Troupe is now enlarging its activities by reconstituting itself into
‘Ranga-Sri’, an institute of theatre arts, with separate training and research
wings manned by a team of field workers and instructors side by side with the ‘
maintenance of the performing company. Plans are in hand to construct its i
own building, specially designed to accommodate a fully equipped residential
centre, with separate wings for different sections and also studio, an open-air- .—

theatre and a theatre hall.
