The Collector’s mind wanders back. In a flash back he sees the homeland
of the Persian girl, its peaceful and serene atmosphere with caravan passing and
girls going to fetch water.
Suddenly a group of Bedouins appear and kidnap the girl.
The market place—scene of gaiety. Gypsies are dancing. The Persian
girl is brought for sale. The bidding is not high enough ; the auctioneer takes
her away. Later in the evening, two bidders ﬁght to have her; a stranger
appears, offers double the price and purchases her. He is the Royal Guard
of the Emperor. He drags her to the palace.
The Emperor is being entertained by his dancing girls when this ravishing
beauty is presented to him.
The girl refuses to surrender to the wishes of the Emperor. He sends
her to the torture chamber.
It is too much for the Collector to bear.

His efforts to save her are in

vain.

Daybreak. The Collector is worried, and tortured by what he had
“seen”.
He decides to leave the palace at once. But. . .
SCEN E 5
As evening approaches, the Collector is again drawn towards the palace
by some invisible force.
The palace is sulky as though she has taken offence: “My heart was full
of contrition but there was no one to whom I can lay it bare or ask for
forgiveness. . . I wished I could sing to the unknown” “0 fire the poor moth
that made a vain effort to fly away has come back to thee ! Forgive it but this
once, burn its wings and consume it in thy flame.”
Through the stormy night, with thunder, lightning and rain he pursues
her. He hears her crying, beating her breast, then laughing madly shouting
and screaming. He goes to console her but the soldiers drag her away. He
runs after them to save her but bangs himself against the ‘Hungry stones’
—which arise from the fathomless doom to bar his path !
Meher Ali’s derisive laughter is heard——“All is false ! All is false !”
