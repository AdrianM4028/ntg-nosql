Produced by National Bhand Theatre,
Wathora (J .K. )

SY N O PS l S
The play is based on a Kashmiri folk tale of a Gosain (Sadhu) and a milk-maid. A
Gosain who lives on Shankaracharya hill comes down daily to fetch milk. The milkmaid—Gopali, who is attracted by the Gosain starts participating in his religious
discourses. The Gosain, unaware of her infatuation, increases his association with
her . taking her keen interest to be a desire for spiritual enlightenment. This contact

encourages her and one day she expresses her love for him. She is ready to
sacrifice everything, renounce worldly comforts and tread upon the difficult path of
the ascetics. But the Gosain who had started their relationship with a tremendous

amount of confidence in his asceticism finds himself unable to face her beauty. At
this point, he vanishes.

The play does not end here. For the dilernna now is how to perform his last rites
in the absence of the body! A situation open to satire which is taken up by the three
uidushaka in the right spirit of the folk forrn~with much aplornb.

D l R E C T O R ’ S NOTE

Bhand Father, the folk theatre form of Kashmir is known for its gesticulation,
satire and mimicry. Unlike the other folk theatre forms which use mythological or

historical themes, Bhand Father is purely secular theatre.
Music plays a very important role in this form. Based on different Ragas and
Talas. it. has its main source in Soofiyana Kalam—a combination of lrani,
