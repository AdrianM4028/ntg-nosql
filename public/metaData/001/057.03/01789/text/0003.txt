KHEL GURU KA ln Malwi

Adaptation of Vatsaraj’s Sanskrit play
Hasya Choodamani by Dr. Karnlesh Dutt Tripathi
Designed and directed by Bansi Kaul
Produced by M.P. Lok Kala Natak Akaderni, Ujjain

SYNOPSIS
Kapatkali, a middle aged prostitute is w0rried about the theft of her ornaments.
She is introduced to a Guru, who pretends to possess the secret knowledge to
name the thief. As good luck would have it, the Guru c0uld name the thief

correctly, who is the lover of her beautiful daughter. The Guru, in due course of
time is also infatuated by her and sends a Vashikaran Mantra to the daughter. The
rebel disciple casts the Mantra to Kapatkali, who comes to Guru to woo him. The
Guru is in a predicament. Meanwhile, the lover sends two strongmen to thrash the
Guru. The disciples befool them by suggesting that Guru possesses occult power

to find out the hidden treasure. They feel tempted and are sent to bring a certain
herb to be applied in the eyes. But a wrong herb which causes pain in the eyes,
creates pandemonium. At the end, the daughter of Kapatkali appears with her
lover and all are happy.

D l R EC TO R’5 NOTE
For the past few years, it has been my endeavour to use the strong phenomenon
of the mofussil culture in my productions. Ujjain being the birth place of Maach, the
folk theatre of the Malwa region of M . P. attracted me. Ujjain also being an ancient
religious centre, the community of Pandas of whom many are addicted to Bhang
have a definite contribution to make to its culture. There are two sorts of Akhadas
in Ujjain, one for the Sadhus and the other for acrobats. To lend a touch of
authenticity, wrestling and acrobatic feats have been incorporated into the play.
The original script has only two characters: one Chela and one Nagar Vadhu.
During improvisation, the number appeared insufficient, so we increased the
number to five Chelas and six Nagar Vadhus. We added five more characters to
lend the play modern relevance. We have kept in view the local slang in evolving the
language of the play. The songs of the play have mostly been tuned in Maach style
of singing used in the Purvaranga.
