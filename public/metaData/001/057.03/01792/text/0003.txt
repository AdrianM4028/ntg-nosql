U. pal Dutt has written this play in a play where artists main
concern is “Show must go on" plus groups survival. For this
even he can go to the extremes of selling his daughter. He wants
to fight the system but cannot. The socral structure does not
z‘Ccept him. The producer does not like his views. They are so
much cngromd in tl‘eir light that they reject a good script
Everyone has a dream of their own choice and in the last
they do it and recognise the plae, write, but he has left.
There is so much irony in the situation that one can't be left
without being moved. On one hand people are starving for want
of food and on the 0‘. her hand British Government and its agents
are exporting f'ood. Likewise the actor is busy doing romantic
plays. It is a play of woman’s Supression and her exploitation by
every section of the society and there is no one to help her.
