KAUN
NA CHA YE
NAACH
The play kaun Nachaye Naach is b.156d on the quesfion that
which power conipzlls us to dance or do actions according to His
instructions or what is the purpose for which we take birth, grow
up and after passing through the different stages our life is over.
The writer raises this question and gives the solution.
While giving answer he starts front the stone age and after
passing through the different stages like slavery, kingship capitalism, politics etc. he comes to the conclusion that nobody in
particular is behind this queszion but it’s only our own motives,
and ambitions which make us to dance. In other words we can

say that we struggle for our own motives and goals.
After the curtain is 011३ two characters named Rangla and
Ranglee appear on the stage in the traditional folk costumes and
dancing in the typical f'olk style they raise the questions “KAUN
NACHAYE NAACH". These two characters start the play and
they can be named as the Sutradhars. When the question Kaun
Nachaye Naach is raised by them there is a sudden change on the
stage and some characters including SARDAR appear on the
stage they depict the picture of stone age and they do actions
according to the man used to do in the the stone age i.e. The
character Rangla is killed by them. Ranglee also faces the same
fate. This all is done in a Symbolic manner and after the action
they go off the stage leaving behind Rangla and Ranglee.
Now Rangla and Ranglee proceed further and Ranglee says

that its only hunger and lust which makes a man to strive hard.
