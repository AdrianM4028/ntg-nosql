observed that the discussion of this
nature will help one and all to know
more about the creative process of the

Presenting his views, the director
said, 'In my production folk elements
are not ornate but functional.
In

as a martyr (Shaheed) is a part of
Islamic belief.
Hence a parallel could
be found between Tippu and Imam Hussein
— the martyr of Karbala.
