Vanishing from Alladin's story the decoits appear in Alibaba's house in search of
the lamp. They got the lamp, but got killed by infighting for possession of the same.
Seeing the story getting confused Gin takes the princess to his story on everybody‘s
demand. When Alibaba wakes from dream, it is understood that the whole story
was a dream.

DIRECTOR'S NOTE
For the first time I had actors who would radically become a cat, a tree or Gabbar

Singh by the sheer pOWer of his imagination, minus all the curde frills. A paper
moon swinging down from the flies was enough to make it nightime, despite the
bright white lights. A crudely cut out hole in a flapping, flimsy curtain would
readily be accepted as a door. The functional austerity of Brecht's theatre Was never
so readily acceptable and loved. I did not have to sit for hours explaining and
convincing, as I had done before with adults actors. The adult actors, involved in

the production, also had their share of revelations, I am sure. During the rehearsals I
could clearly see them struggle to keep pace with this dynamic, imaginative faculty.
It became all too evident to all adults that the ruthless logic of theatre gives a damn
to conventional trappings that we try to cover it up with That theatre is not a place
for hiding, making things look artiﬁcially beautiful. That theatre is bright, naked
and not afraid to show.
