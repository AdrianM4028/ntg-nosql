SYNOPSIS
A destitute, frustrated, Untouchable Menaka, deprived of her share from her father~
in-law's well-being, suffers from the humiliations and hatred of her brood by caste
'HINDUS', and wreaths in pain and desire for vengeance.

Most unexpectably her hated in-laW's young, unmarried daughter Kamala comes
imploring for help. The wench is pregnant by Moniram, a Hindu youth.

Menaka's ﬁst impulse is to make use of this 'bastardly' secret against her in-law's

house, then suddenly she sees the potentiality of the situation in blowing up the
pride and vanity of the Hindus. She feels the honour of her breed is surely greater
then her petty, personal sufferings.

She meets the youth and of course, a fisherwoman that Menaka is, desterously catches
the biggest ever fish of her life.
The Hindu Monirarn leaves his community, comes to the house of Karnala, and stys
there as a domesticated husband.

And this only is the beginning of the end of Hindu pride and Vanity; proclaims
Menaka.

DIRECTOR '8 NOT E
Our choosing of Hornen Borgohain's fiction 'Matsyagandha' has been determined

chieﬂy for the realism of the fiction. The story is of casterisrn, untouchability,
poverty, love. betrayal and vengeance. Though the title has the unmistakable

mythical ring, the novel itself has little fiction and has no myth.
It is the old story of Mahabharata repeating itself before, and even after Gandhi.
For, casteism has been an eternal curse here in this country.

The play has been divided into two parts, the ﬁrst-part dealing with the 'causes and
.eircumstances', the second;with the 'events' these led to without any derivation from
or distortion of the origin story or characters.
Efforts have been given to convey the realism of the play by presenting it in the realistic
style on naturalistic set.
