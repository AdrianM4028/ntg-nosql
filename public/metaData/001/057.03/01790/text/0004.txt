SYNOPSIS
Religious fanaticism destroys the human sensibility. It comes with its hideous form
where people of different faiths and religion use to live. Ours is‘ a such type of
country. But it comes in the play as an ideal secular state. On the other hand a
distant country - 'DOOR DESH' has been imagined where religion has its deep root
in the _socio—political system and it interacts with each and every aspect of life.
These opposite poles come together in the play. This develops into a typical
contrast and leads people to take a decisive step.
Play reveals prolixity of fanatic behaviour with its all shades and hues.

DIRECTOR'S NOTE
'Door Desh Ki Katha' deals with a hiterto untouched subject, i.e. religious-fanaticism and its effect.
The play has been crafted in farce : the whole thing comes forward in an exaggerated form to make the problem enlarged ; so that the ugliness of fanantic faces and
their strengthening “forces could be exposed completely. This provides a hilarious,
but not least serious, development of dramatic crescendo.

Putting a serious theme in theatrical farce style leads to an ironical contrast of
fantasy and reality.

The play creates itself a world of fantasy where every thing is nothing but farce,
unveiling the" reality.

The production proposes to utilise folk theatre devices and street play (Nukkad
Natak) and other urban theatre techniqes at once. The informal presentational style
and flexible form' of-both rural and street theatre have creatively been interwomen
in the total structure of production.
