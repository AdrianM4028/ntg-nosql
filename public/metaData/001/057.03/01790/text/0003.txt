SYNOPSIS
The message of this play is manifold, briefly it 'deals with the concept of time as the -

fourth dimension, the creator of illusions and reality.
It is complete with a few characters like an oldman,a middleaged man, a yount'man,
a boy, a man (of uncertain age) wearing a clock-face as a mask, a policeman and

two girls, (split immages of each other) with this cast and th'e’ﬂiting appearance of
an old man and an oldwornan, the stage is set for a dialogue about time. It is
e_stablished in the play what occured in the past, is being repeated to—day and will be

repeated tomorrow also. So the very presence of time is valueless or zero.

DIRECTOR'S NOTE
In my career, as a theatre director for the first time I am directing such an absurd
play. In my endeavour I have tried to go beyond the traditional forms. The theme,
compositions, sequences and the dialogues have been knitted well to provoke
interest. Geometrical movement and other dramatic technique have been adopted

for strong visual effect.
