It is the eighteenth day of the great battle
of Kurukshetra. A soldier asks his father's permission to go to the battle-field to fight for the
karauvas. The father tries to dissuade his son,
telling that the war is useless and causes
destruction for a common man. The son however joins the army.

Three soldiers enter searching for their
relatives amidst the heap of dead bodies. They
had also taken part in the war. During the
process they describe the horror of the battle field and the aftermath of the war.
Two soldiers, scared to death, come run-

ning from the battle-field near Vysampayana.
They have seen a terrible fight between
Bheema and Duryodhana. After the fight,
enters Durjaya, the only son of Duryodhana,
who has lost his mother and his grandparents
in the battle-field. He meets his father and
demands to sit on his lap. But Duryodhana
who has broken his thighs cannot allow him to
do so. Disappointed, Durjaya asks many questions about war to which his father has no
answers. War, the unnecessary act of human
civilisation makes the boy leave his father and
continue his search for his mother and
grandparents.
