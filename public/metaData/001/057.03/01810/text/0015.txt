king beholds Loona and her beauty overwhelrns him. Salwan. the king. is already mar-

ried and has a grown-up son. He wishes to
marry Loona and does so. The news of the
king's marriage upsets his first wife lshraan and
she leaves for her parents' home.

Loona enters the palace with the hope of
a new and happy life. However, her hope is
belied by the harsh reality that her husband cannot satisfy her sexual need.
Prince Pooran, who was kept in prison for
a long time is released. Loona falls for the

young man. But Pooran refuses to reciprocate,
saying that she is as good as his mother. Enraged Loona complains to the king that Pooran
tried to seduce her. King Salwan is shocked.
He orders for Pooran's execution as a just
punishment for the alleged crime.

Director’s Note
The Play is a dramatic adaptation of
Shiv Kurnar Batalwi's Punjabi poem. As in
the folk tale women are taken advantage of
by the mighty even today, and it is more so
when the woman is socially backward. The
play attempts to find new and contemporary

meaning in the text. .
