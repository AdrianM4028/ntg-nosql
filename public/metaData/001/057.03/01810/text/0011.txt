Director’s Note
The story of Chanda is deeply integrated into the ethos of the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh.
The Bednis are looked down upon by
other caste people in the region. Be—
cause of their talent in rope-dancing
and their socio-economic background,
they are compelled to serve as entertainers to zamindars and the nobility in
a feudal system. The play is an adaptation of a folk legend that is popular in
the region. The theme of the play is inspired by Hindi poet Anjaneya's poem
'Naach' which describes the difficuities
of rope-dancing relating to an artist’s
problems. The same problem is faced
by the rope-dancer Chanda Bedni,
hence the play is a unique interaction
between a modern poem and a folk
|eg en d .

A Brahrnin youth falls in love with
Chanda. a girl belonging to the Bedni
tribe. Chanda sets conditions impossible for the youth to fulfil. But the

and dedication, and cannot but reciprocate his love. A crisis ensues in both
the communities. The king, who himself is in love with Chanda becomes
jealous and decides to interfere. Equally jealous. the queen makes Chanda

is on the verge of winning. the shoemaker's help is taken to cut the rope as
the legend goes.
