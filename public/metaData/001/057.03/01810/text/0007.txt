Banjari would not leave Vanmanush
to the shepherd. Instead she asks him to
send a barber next morning. The barber
does his job and Vanmanush emerges out
as a handsome young man.

Sense of exploration is one of the
srtongest urges the man has. Given to indulgence he forgets the nature that nurtured
him, fondled him. He ignores nature out of

his own ignorance.

Man has come out of the womb of nature. Nature watches him grow. But his
desire to rearch perfection leads him away
from her. Still nature cannot stop loving him
and tries to bring him back to her lap. Nature repeats the process all over again by
recreating him in order to nurture something.
