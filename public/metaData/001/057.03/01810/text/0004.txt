KARNATAKA NATAK ACADEMY

Karnataka Nataka Academy has taken active part in the development of theatre in Karnataka. In the current year, several measures have
been adopted to ensure the growth of professional, amateur and folk
theatre in the state.

The Academy extended ﬁnancial aid to selected professional
theatre groups and has initiated the Complete Study of Professional
Theatre Companies. In order to mitigate the problems faced by professional theatre, the Academy proposes to erect semi -permanent theatres
in some centres and provide scholarships to the artistes' children. In an
effort to boost the conditions of folk theatre forms, the Academy has

conducted Folk Theatre Festival and a Training Workshop to make an
indepth study of the folk theatre form.

Ranga-Vasantha - was a unique attempt to provide a facelift to
amateur theatre movement. Under this scheme, new plays were staged
in all the 20 districts of the state. The selected plays took part in the
State-level Theatre Festival at Bangalore and also in the Theatre Festivals at New Delhi, Madras and Bombay.

The other activities of the Academy include conducting Industrial
Theatre Festivals and providing financial assistance to new plays. The
ﬁrst-ever youth theatre festival was held at all six Universities to involve
the youth in theatre movement. Also major workshops were conducted
at Ridar, Bijapur and Bangalore in colllaboration with National School of
Drama, Delhi.

To pledge its support for national unity and harmony, the Academy
hosted an Art-cum-Cultural festival under the banner 'Sneha-Sauharda.‘

Now, for the ﬁrst time in Karnataka the Karanataka Nataka Academy is
organising the National Theatre Festival, jointly with Sangeet Natak
Akaderni, New Delhi and the Government of Karnataka. Apart from the
Main Festival at Bangalore, the shows are also arranged at Dharwar,
Belgaurn, Bijapur and Gulbarga.
