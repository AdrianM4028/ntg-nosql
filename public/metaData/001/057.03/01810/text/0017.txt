The play

DIRECTORâ€™S NOTE

The traditional tale of circling the earth and the
throne by the two sons of the Enternal God father in
Meitei lore is nerrated to interprete in a new outlook for
our search for the identity of the Meiteis.

It is an attempt to create theatrical idiom from the traditional cultural patterns, and weave the tale, expand it and
project the reality of our own life. Images from martial arts,
folk forms are inter woven theatrically and give more meaning to the mythical tale.

Here, in an allegorical form, two brothers fought
for the throne. While the more powerful elder brother
went around the earth. in conquest of peoples and
States to show his might to the throne. the weaker and
younger brother just went around the throne through
his mother's advise and secured the throne. The play
seeks to emphasize the womanly mother as the symbol
of all source of energy, knowledge. wisdom and
strength.
