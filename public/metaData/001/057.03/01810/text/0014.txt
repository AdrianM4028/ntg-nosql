The production is a result of the
experiments to evolve a theatre language of images largely inspired by the
regional performance modes. In the absence of scenic elements. the language
of visual and oral images are used so
as to suppliment the effect of cornmunication through spoken language.
To meet the demands of theatre. the
resources and the energy of the artists
are fully utilised. The tradition of the
people of Jamrnu Hills is very much evident in the group songs.
