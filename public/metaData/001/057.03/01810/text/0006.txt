Director’s Note
Nautanki is a folk form of Northern
India which emphasises on music and narration rather than acting. An effort is made to
discover the possibilities of this style in
newer and contemporary context in this
production.
The basic theme of the play has been
inspired by SarV'eshwar Dayal Saxena’s
play ‘Larai', The language used in the play
is a mixture of Avadhi. Bundeli and Brij as
spoken in small towns and the objective is
to preserve the spirit of the nautanki form, al-

though the melodramatic elements have
been trimmed. The play is presented in a
combination of Hathrasi and Kanpuri
nautanki styles, with a few extracts from
Ustad Inderrnan and Pt. Natha Ram Gaur's
nautanki 'Satya Harisuchandra.’ At certain
places poems of Dhumil and Dushyant
Kumar have been used.
