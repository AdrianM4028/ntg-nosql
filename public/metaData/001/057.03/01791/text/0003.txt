OPSIS
' ३ The play is based on epiSodes from the Mahabharata. Duryodhana insults the
Pandavas in the Kuru-sahha with remarks about their parentage. All the
Pandavas, especially Bhima, are enraged. Lord Krishna tells Bhima the secret of

Duryodhana’s birth. Bhima insults Duryodhana by divulging this in the next '
Kuru-sabha. This angers Duryodhana, who swears to wipe out King Gandhara’s

- clan to avenge his blemished birth. King Gandhara, a matchless dice player,
allows Shakuni to survive and take revenge on Duryodhana. Shakuni promises
to do so. Duryodhana makes Shakuni his prime minister. This is where the end
begins.

DIRECTOR’S ३ NOTE _

.

.

.

The signiﬁcance of the Mahabharata war is eternal. Even today all major
destruction emanates from minor issues like the game of dice. The play
employs Chhau movements and the narrative mode of gitz'natya cast in leathagayana style.
