THE PARTICIPANTS
Most of those participating in this
production are members of the DEVAVANEE-MANDIRAM (Sanskrit Stage).
This institution has been started with the
idea of producing plays in Sanksrit so as to
make the average Indian familiar with
spoken Sanskrit.

In the past two years, the following
four plays have been produced and broadcast through All-India Radio:
i.

Kalidasa-Caritam (an adaptation
from the original full-length play

by SE. Velankar).
ii.

Kailasa-Kampah

iii.

S wa t a n t ry a-Lak s h m i

iv.

Hutatrna

.The Mandiram also encourages the
wr1t1ng ofnew Sanskrit plays with a View
to presentlng them on the stage. It proposes to present a new modern Sanskrit
play in New Delhi shortly.
