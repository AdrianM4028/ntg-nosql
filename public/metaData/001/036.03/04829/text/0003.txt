A Message from the Mahindra Group
It's another pursuit but it's not for a new product, not for a new
milestone, and it's not even for a new business venture. The Mahindra

Group has made excellence in theatre its goal. The Mahindra Theatre
Festival culminating in the Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards
(META) sees the group firmly on course. With a pan- Indian
representation, the final 10 plays are truly the best of the best produced
in India this year.
The Mahindra Group shows a great commitment to supporting the social
and cultural environment in which it exists. And theatre, unlike cinema,

has not received sufficient corporate backing. By instituting these
awards, the group hopes to drive theatre in India to reach higher
standards of excellence, just like in the corporate world, where

competition and recognition play a major role in achieving higher
standards.
The Mahindra Group wishes you all a wonderful time at the Mahindra
Theatre Festival!
