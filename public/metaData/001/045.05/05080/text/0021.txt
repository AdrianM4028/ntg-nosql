students and revealed the casting. Now, Abhilash asked them to lead the exercises again with the presented
structure and given characters.
The exercises began again. There was enthusiasm thus the process continued. Now, it went on the idea of
ﬂight within ﬂight—on board people showing their minds about others. Meanwhile, we had had a few sessions
with Pilots and Airhostesses too. An Airhostess trained our students with discipline. Further, in the process, the
students had also seen different videos and movies made on the subject. Finally, all the required scenes
according to the structure were improvised once again with the cast. At the end, a poem—especially written by
Rajesh was given to the students to make three-four versions for the end of the performance. And the students
created the versions nicely.
As we have only half of the group out of 26 from the ﬁnal year students, the idea came to have a few artists from
outside to become co-passengers in the plane. Some of our friends were happily agreed to accompany our
students in this small journey. This effort continued till the end of the process and, Rajesh came up with full
performance text with written dialogues that were comprised by the actors very close to the performance.
The Title

Meanwhile, a time came when we had to name the performance. Rajesh mentioned a word- Lorem lpsum
in a free time chat which remained somewhere back of the head of Abhilash who asked all of us whether
Lorem lpurn would be beﬁtting title for performance. We were surprised but seeing back to our process of
getting into a different terrain we thought why not! Then the performance was named as Lorem lpsum, on
Thin Air...
Lorem lpsum is actually a Latin term for dummy text used in the publishing and graphic design industry
from last ﬁve centuries. When an unknown printer takes a galley of type and scrambles it to make a type
specimen, he replaces meaningful content with dummy text allowing viewers to focus only on graphic
aspects such as font, typography and page layout and without being distracted by the content. The actual

text of Lorem lpsum used as dummy is as follows:"Lorem ipsurn dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore
magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation u/lamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
cornmodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla
pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in cu/pa qui ofﬁcia deserunt mo/Iit anim id est
Iaborum. "
But it is to be noted that Lorem lpsum text is not typically nonsensical as it seems to be. It has taken from
a scrambled section of De ﬁnibus bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil), a 1st—century BC
Latin classical text by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper
Latin. The meaning of this Latin text can be found in H. Rackham's 1914 translation-in the aforementioned
Loeb Classical Library edition- with the major source of lorern ipsurn highlighted :[32] . . . . loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances
