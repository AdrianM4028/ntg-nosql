THE ADVENTURES

At the feast, Odysseus tells the story of his voyage
from Troy and his many adventures, we include :
The battle with the Cincones, whose city he sacks.

His landing on the shore in the country of the Lotus
Eaters, whose opium-like drug nearly enslaves
several of his men.
His blinding of the one—eyed cannibal giant
Polyphemus, son of Poseidon.

The next day Telemachus goes to the palace. Seeing
that he has become a man, Penelope decides to
honour the command given to her by Odysseus
before he left for Troy, and announces that she will
choose a husband from among the suitors the
following day.
Odyssseus arrives at the palace, still in disguise,
and is attacked and insulted. He speaks with
Penelope, who does not recognise him, and reveals
himself to his old nurse Eurycleia, and to Eumaeus.
That night they remove the suitors weapons from
the hall.
The next day Penelope, prompted by a dream sent
to her by Athene, tells the suitors that whoever
can string and fire Odysseus succeeds, and he and
Telemachus slaughter the suitors and the unfaithful
servants.

Odysseus reveals himself to Penelope and the Gods
looks down on their reunion.
