couple of months ago! Straight, unforced readings, technically immaculate and

vehement playing, particularly in the vivacious pantoum were a delight to the senses.
It was sheer ambrosia.

chuber-t’s blissfully happy Trio in B ﬂat, 0p. 99, so rich in cheerful melody and
remarkable keys switches - B ﬂat to C minor to D to Bﬂat, etc... And to bring out the
delicious sounds, the unfailiable Trio Woueck! In the first movement; where the

rincipal tune soils in at once, “all sunshine and swagger”, the ensemble brought
authority and weight, at the same time, imbuing the music with charm and warmth.
The internal balance, the tonal blend and the rhythmic poise were allfaultless. The
ong—like Andante, though relaxed, was beautifully coloured and shaped. It saw some
avishing string playing too.

The playful chatte
y the Trio in Eﬂat that moves leisurely, was given an exquisite reading - the rhythms
were acute and sensitive, without any loss of sweetness. Finally, the delightfully
kittish rondo, muscular and friendly, in which the pianist endowed her part with
hythmic sinew and proved to be such a positive keyboard partner to the ravishing
”in: playing. An unforgettable experience! Encore!
