Over 20 years ago, a band of artists, actors and
musicians, created, in a small village in Cornwall, a
theatre group. They adopted a communal life and began
their work in a barn belonging to the Hon. Oliver Foot.
They played the shows inspired by local legends, on town
squares, village greens, wherever people gathered. In
1975, the Footsbarn Travelling Theatre bought its first
theatre-tent. In 1981, the group left England with families
and children to travel the world in caravans. In the course
of their travels and meetings with others theatre groups,
new members joined the company, and Footsbarn
developed a truly international profile, a mixture of
nationalities, everyone adopting the travelling life with
all its joys and pitfalls.

In 1990 Footsbarn decided to buy a farm in the
centre of France, near Hérisson. The farm serves at the

creative base of the company with ofﬁces, workshops for
costumes, masks, decor, rehearsal rooms, a fully
equipped camping area for the vans and caravans, and
even a classroom for the children. However, in the
courtyard the truck wait, always readyfor a newjourney.
In the twenty four years of existence, Footsbarn
has created over 50 productions. The collective
productions reﬂect the multiple inﬂuences of the group,
but Footsbarn has always been true to its original
aesthetic, in the tradition of the strolling players from
medieval times, and to its passion for Shakespeare having
adapted six of his plays : The Tempest, Hamlet, the King
Lear, Macbeth, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and most

recently, Romeo and Juliet.
