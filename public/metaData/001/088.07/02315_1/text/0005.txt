Théﬁtre -

द्विष्ठिडेहूँश्चि

Movement, burlesque, the music has as much
importance as the text. The actors, skilled in many
theatrical techniques are at once clowns, acrobats and
puppeteers.... Footsbarn recreates, in its own way, using
as a base the circus and Commedia dell Arte. The spirit
of the Globe Theatre. Its originality is to develop an
inventive theatricality, joyful, but rigorous. Footsbarn
has maid though the magic of its shows a philosophy, an
antidote to the daily grind. At a time when utopias are
judged suspect, this adventure is ongoing.
