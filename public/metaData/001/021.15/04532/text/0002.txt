In this play a man and a woman lose their way in the
wilderness at a sleepless night, and seek shelter in a lonely

wa

house. And .eerife old man, who claims to bethe owner of

thehouse, welcomes them. Who is the solitary man in the
desolate house? How old is he? Why does this man
perturb the Woman and not her husband? The night is a .
strange; transitién from a seemingly blissful maigriage, to a «.
thrilling adﬁenture, eventually culminating into a strange
revelation the life ofthe woman.

The play sets one ’s thinking about the plausibility of the
institution of marriage without undermining its sanctity
and necessity. The play also helps to bring out unseen
layers of relationship in front of us. The issue does not

hold any bias and is relevant to both man and woman. As
this question is appropriate and necessary in today’s
world, it is:.,thoughtfull%y put across by the playwright
Badal Sarcaif.
