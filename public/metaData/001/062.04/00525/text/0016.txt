Not taking into account many act plays and those he wrote for boys and girls, his
plays can broadly be placed under four categories. Only a few of them have been translated
into English. It is debatable if all of them could be because some of them, Ac/zalayatan
for instance, could be properly rendered into English. Bisarjan (Sacriﬁce), Dak Ghar (Post
Oﬁice) andRaktakarabi (Red Oleanders) have been so translated and many others could be
so done.

In the ﬁrst group can be included Chirakumar Sabha, Sesh Raksha, Sod/zboa'h, Griha-

prabesh and Bansari. The ﬁrst two are by far the best comedies in Bengali, exquisitely reﬁned
and witty. All these plays have been staged. as has been mentioned before except Bansari,
so far I can recollect. Tagore has created a character in Bansari not very easy to portray.
Raja Rani, Bisarfan, Tapati are emotional plays in blank verse. Because of their
dramatic appeal these have been staged. These are comparatively more read because of
intrinsic literary quality. These two groups of Tagore’s play are according to the generally
accepted canons of drama.

In order to release the rhythm of human movement from the shackles of formalism,
Tagore evolved a system of dance. He had to ﬁnd a medium for his own ideas of dance and
song. Thus came to be created dance dramas like Chitrangada, Shyama, Chandalika and
others. Because of appeal of music and dance these have been popular on the stage. These
are very widely read as well because of the beautiﬁc creation.
In the fourth category will come plays like Dak Ghar (Post Ofﬁce) Sharadotsab,
Achalayatan, Rakrakarabi (Red Oleanders) and Mukradhara. Tagore was a life long crusader
against blind following, superstition and fetters in any form. In order to give concrete shape
to his ideas he conceived of dramatic forms which would visually present characters living
upto their beliefs. These plays are not limited by time and place and to that extent these
deviate from traditional form. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a parallel in any literature. Once it
