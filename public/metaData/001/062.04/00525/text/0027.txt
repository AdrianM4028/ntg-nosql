The three smart girls from Paris are touring India to study oriental
fashions. Their modern Agfa cameras are loaded with Agfacolor ﬁlm
to enable them to capture the traditional excellence of Indian handloom textiles in all their colourful beauty. Thanks to Agf'acolor

photography, lavishly printed French magazines will present the art
of India’s weavers to the fashion centres of Europe, thereby helping
to promote India’s export of handloom fabrics.
Tourists to India and Indian tourists abroad carry Agfa cameras
loaded with Agfa ﬁlm—hence help promote international friendship

through photography.
