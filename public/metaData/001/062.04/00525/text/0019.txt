it compels the audience to a feeling of really being a part as it were of the slice of life which is
being portrayed.
Lastly the actor has a great responsibility towards his fellow players. It is not only a
question of not trying to steal every scene. It is being the kind of person that everyone else
likes to act with. It is a matter of being considerate, ﬁrst in regard to rehearsals; never missing unless it is a matter almost of life and death, for the other players cannot rehearse properly

it' one or more of the cast is frequently absent. More especially, at the time of the run of a
production, it is a matter of playing up to the other players, helping them to achieve the
necessary conﬁdence and to bring the best out of their lines. An actor who is constantly
waiting for his cue line and thinking of what his next line is, is like a bad conversationalist

who is obviously not listening to what the other person is talking about and is only waiting
for the opportunity to interrupt. The good actor listens to the other players and in so doing
he not only is the better actor for it, because the audience realises he is really portraying
character properly, but also he is helping the other players. he is playing up to them and thereby helping them to portray their own parts even better.
