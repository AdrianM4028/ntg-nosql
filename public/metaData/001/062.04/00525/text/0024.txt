team will not earn marks. The judges would be bored by the play and annoyed by the
futile attempts of the producers to camouﬂage it. Therefore selection ofa good and
produceable play is most essential.

One good thing about these festivals is that the drama critics of the Press are
always invited to the shows. This gives an opportunity of getting considered criticism.
It is, however, seen that there are some dramatic critics who are reluctant to criticise fully
in case they offend and mention only the good points in a play. On the other extreme
there are critics who have their pet theories and prejudices and judge everything from a
personal angle, Such critics are not helpful in any way. There must be criticism in an
objective way. Good and bad should be judged relatively, with proper reasoning, and

the critics should not be afraid to point out the defects for the beneﬁt of the amateurs.
I may end up by saying wrthout the least fear of contradiction that the amateur
. dramatic movement in India has made marked progress in recent years and is growing
from strength to strength. The drama festivals organised in different cities are providing
the incentive for better and intelligent productions. The day is not far off when we shall
see in all cities and many villages that the Drama has taken its rightful place in our
everyday life wielding the correct inﬂuence on our people to make India happier and
prosperous.
