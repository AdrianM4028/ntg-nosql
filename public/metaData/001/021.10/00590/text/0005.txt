eyelids, who wakes to find Bottom the weaver near

her, wearing an ass's head [Bottom and a company of
Athenian tradesmen are in the wood to rehearse a play

for the Duke's wedding, and Puck has put an ass's head

on Bottom]; Titania at once becomes enamoured or him,
and toys with his 'amiable cheeks' and 'fair large ears'.

Oberon, finding them together, reproaches Titania for
bestowing her love on an ass, and again demands the
Changeling boy, whom she in her confusion surrenders,
whereupon Oberon releases her from the charm. Puck at

Oberon's orders throws a thick fog about the human
lovers, and brings them all together, unknown to one
another, and they fall asleep. He applies a remedy to
their eyes, so that when they awake they return to their
former loves. Thesus and Egeus appear on the scene, the
runaways are forgiven, and the couples married. The play

ends with the scene of ’Pyramus and Thisbe‘, comicaliy

acted by Bottom and his fellow tradesmen, to grace these
nuptiais and those of Thesus and Hippolyta.
