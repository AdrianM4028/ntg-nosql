S
is: Hermie, ordered by her father, Egeus, to
marry Demetrius, refuses, because she loves Lysender,

while Demetrius has formerly professed love for her
friend Helena, and Helena loves Demetrius. Under the
law of Athens, Theseus, the duke, gives Hermie four
days in which to obey her father; else she must
suffer death or enter a nunnery. Hermie end
Lysander agree to leave Athens secretly in order to
be married where the Athenian law cannot pursue

them, and to meet in a wood, a few miles from the
city. Hermie tells _ Helena of the proiect, and the
latter tells Demetrius. Demetrius pursues Hermie to
the wood, and Helena Demetrius, so that all four are
that night in the wood. This wood is the favourite
of the fairies.

Oberon and Titania, king and queen of the fairies,
have quarreiled, because Titania refuses to give up

to him a littlechangeling boy for a page. Oberon
tells Puck, a mischevlous sprite, to fetch him a
certain magic flower, of which he will press the

juice on the eyes of Titania while she sleeps, so
that she may fall in love with what she first sees

when she wakes. Overhearing Demetrius in the wood
reproaching Helena for foilowing him, and desirous
to reconcile them , Oberon orders Puck to place some
of the love-juice on Demetrius’s eyes, but so that
Helena shall be near him when he does it. Puck,

mistaking Lysandar for Demetrius, applies the love—
charm to him, and it chances that Helena is the
first person that Lysander sees, to whom he at once
makes love, enraging her because she thinks she is
made a jest of; Oberon discovering Puck's mistake,
now places some of the juice on Demetrius‘s eyes,

and he on waking first "sees Helena,so that both

Lysander and Demetrius are now making leve to
Helena. The ladies fall to high words and the men
go off to fight for Helena.
