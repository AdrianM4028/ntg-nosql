The folk Drama is the only indigenous form with which Modern
India has an un-interrupted link, and it provides an anthentic & colourful
background to the current Theatre movement in India. The folk forms
are many and varied in each region of our country. So has Kashmir its
f'olk Drama still rich in content & presentation.

Bhand Father, the folk Drama of Kashmir is performed in open &
starts with a musical prelude of about two or more musicians at Nagara,
Shahnai & D01 and these musicians act as narrators like those of sutardars
of Sanskrit Plays-and make their entry from the audience. The audience
responding to every syllable of performers, forms a part ofthe Pather. After
the musical prelude begins which is built round the century old traditions
of Dance, Music, Action and humourous dialogues so much much so that a

complete Drama evolves out of it. Essentially meant as entertainment and
relief to the peasant folk from their humdrum life, laughter is sustained
throughout the pather by mixing Farce, Satire, mimicry and redicule so that
there is no room for seriousness in it. Bhands from a class by themselves and
each class belongs to a particular place has its peculiar accent and mode of
presentation though the subject matter may be common. The subjects round
which Pathers are built arez—Navid Parker, Bata Parker, Wattal Pather,
Mala Pather, Greece Pather, Raza Father, Gusane Pather, Shikargah,

Darz pather etc.

Today’s drama. is a Raza Pather.

This has been improvised in it's

content, costume, colour & has been taken up by our troup to retain the
link with our age old traditions of our indigenous Theatre in the Valley.
