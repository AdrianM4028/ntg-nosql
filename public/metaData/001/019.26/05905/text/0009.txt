‘TALASH’, is a play altogether diﬂerent from those which are mentioned
in the Souvenir.

The story revolves round a modern man—an intellectual. his inner
conﬂict and his tragedy. The elements of sympbolism and fantaSy are mixed
in such a way that deserve a calm listening. The locale of the play IS a
portion of a Park which is close to a street of a modern city. The play
begins with the arrival of an unsophisticated, rustic and innocent man. . . . an
old Gujjar in the modern city for whom everything is charming. He is
pleased to see the aminities of life . . . . hear and watch about human progress.
But the modern man having everything at hand is restless. . . . How the tale
develops ‘2 What happens to Gujjar. . . . What makes the modern man
restless and frustrated? All this forms the pipeline of our Production
. . . . "I‘ALASH’.
