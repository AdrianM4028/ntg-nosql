“GRAND REHEARSAL”
A WA R D—1 9 67

'I‘HE play ‘Grand Rehearsal’ written by Sarvashri Pushker Bhan and SN.
Sadhu hinges upon Prof. Ashok’s desire to prepare a play for the
Inter-collegian Drama Festival. In Spite of his hard efforts and continuous
endeavour, he does not get a good stuff of boys who could be taught acting.
Days come nearer and nearer still; and hours go waste in training up the
boyS—but all in vain.
Sultan (The quack) a senior student of the College is very serious
about his role and Prof. Ashok takes special interest in training him and
advises him to rehears his role at home before a life size looking glass or
in the presence of a close relation. Sultan takes the advice very seriously
and goes to a relation donned in the dramatic dress that makes him look a
real quack. To his dismay he ﬁnds a person, quite a stranger to him, in
the drawing room which he thought, was the drawing room of his cousin
who was away at Gulmarg that day.
Unable to retrace his steps he has
no alternative but to rehear to act the part so seriously as to look a real

quack.

Nirmalla, the wife of Prof. Ashok (tenants in the house of cousin)

comes into the drawing room and Sultan-as ill luck would have it Speaks
out all his dialogues which arouse Niimalas feelings of suspicionin the ﬁdelity

of her husband. Consequently taking the Charlatan’s words for gOSpel truth
a scufﬂe takes place at Prof. Ashok’s house in the evening and it develops
into so serious a situation that Nirmala leaves her house on account of her
ﬁrm belief in Prof. Ashok’s deep initirnacy with a college girl.
Prof. Ashok is taken aback when he comes to understand that the

actor imposter had actually cheated him of his wife.
