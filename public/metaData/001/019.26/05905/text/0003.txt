Ladies and gentlemen,
Big events make history which are recorded and smaller events turn
into cherished memories during one’s life. Blessed be the day when ‘RUNGMUNCH’ the brain child of Makhanlal Saraf took a real shape. We can
never forget April the 23rd 1967 when this brain child moved into its infant
toddling. With the patronage of gatherings like the one which we have
today, the infant has come to stay and is getting stronger.

Our Dramatic club ‘Rungmunch’ has been doing some good work in
the past which needs no introduction as the Souvenir which is in your hands
gives a clear picture. Among its Seven Productions so far staged, Four
Productions have been awarded the Best Production Award by the J & K
Academy of Art, Culture and Languages, besides winning three
commendation Awards for the Best Acting and Medals for the Best Performance. Your continued patronage both in the Capital and our State
will allow this small ‘David’ of ours to come up successful among the
‘Goliaths’ of Dance, Drama and Music, which function in the country

reinforced by the monetary assets.
Now I may bring to your notice that the ‘Rungmunch’ is the only
amateur Dramatic Club in Jammu and Kashmir State which has moved out

of the State and has come down to the Capital with a repertoir ofplays in
Kashmiri to acquaint the Theatre people, intelligentsia and the persons who

are connected with this particular line of Fine Art with the culture of present day Kashmir which has a rich past from time immemorial. This effort

will positively help us to get closer with the Theatre of other parts of the
country.

We are thankful to the J & K Academy of Art, culture & languages
who have sponsored our programme at New Delhi.

We are also thankful to our friends in New Delhi who have worked
with us for all these days and have extended their cooperation.
