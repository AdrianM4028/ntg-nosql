A Hypocritical Community
‘Sarnples’ from all walks of life of a whole community gathered in Sri—
nagar the other day only to get exposed. The credit for this accomplishment
goes to the local Rungmunch Productions—a theatre group which has Specialised in the production ofhurnorous and satirical plays and which has already
to its credit three State Academy Awards for its earlier productions. The
occasion was the enactment of a Kashrniri play “Taqdeer Saaz” written by
the famous Kashmiri writer, Ali Mohammed Lone, and produced and
directed by Makhan Lal Saraf ‘Mastana’.

The ‘exposure’ or the drama starts with an assembly of people from all
walks of life gathered under the banner ‘Free Thinkers Forum’. There is a
politician, a writer-social reformer, a journalist, and also a lady interested in
education and culture. The politician—a double-faced personality of the
modern society—is made uneaSy by the sudden presence of a young man who
questions him too closely on what is hidden behind the mask of concern for
the well—being of the humanity. The writer-social reformer, haranguing his
deep study of the evil social practices and his dedication to their eradication
through the medium of his own literature, is laid on the mat when his own
daughter confronts him on the stage.

The journalist, christened by his own self one ﬁne morning as ‘Dawood
Lahoti’ ﬁnds himself placed in circumstances in which he confesses that the
riches and social status he has attained had been solely due to his having
condemned those who fell, and worshipped others who ascended on the

stair of political fortune. The lady leader of the cultural heritage identiﬁes
the great Kashmiri poet Wahab Khar as ‘some blacksmith’, refusing, as she

is questioned, to commit the ‘disgraceful’ act of speaking in her own mothert o n g ue .
