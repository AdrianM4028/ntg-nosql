",Hilo Mat Dulo Mat" reminds us of one .of our earliar
३ productions “Chal Mere Kaddu . . . , . .
The play is a

’

३३ "गृष्ठटाण्डि on the family institutionr but what makes it very
refreshingly different is the novelty of treatment given by

. Sai Paranjpye. '
- ln ‘ the past 91years we have produced mostly plays written
'in languages other than Hindi including Marathi, Bengali,

३ Tamil, Malayalam Er Gujarati. But it is for the first time that
there has been almost a ' deliberate inclusion in the cast 'of
- actors and actresses belonging to non Hindi speaking
regions, the credit for this largely goes to Sai—the 'director
of this play,‘and undoubtedly bouquets to the cast, Lakshmi

Krishnamurty, Saraswati Achar, Vani Subbanna,& Sudhir
Kulkarni, particularly Lakshmi for whom it is the first time
in Hindi on stage or even off stage. Can it be said there~ fore, that Hindi Speaking actors also need to reverse this
traffic—Sometime !
We would take this opportunity .of welcoming those in our

cast who have associated with us for the first time namely
