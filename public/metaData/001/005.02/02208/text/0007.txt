MESSAGE
Ekjut, a leading dramatic group in U. P. has been doing comme—
ndable work in providing recreation to the public of Kanpur and

maintaining a link with other states of the country in acquiring
National Integration and sense of Unity in Diversity. The group

has artists of reputed fame and experience. What it needs today
is moral support from the citizen of all walks of life particularly
by those who have been and are associated with cultural activit-

ies and amateur artists.

‘

With the support of all, the organisation is bound to reach its

glory and fame.
My appeal to one and all is to come forward and give your wh-

olehearted support to this dramatic group.

Sd.
(Dr. R. P. BHASIN)
