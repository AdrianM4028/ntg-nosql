"नव्रआ फ़रियादी है किसीको शो९ती--एस्तहरीर का
कागृजी है पैरहन हर रोवर-ए-तस्वीर का

ऐ खुदा ज़माना मुझ क्रो मिटाता है किसलिए,

लोह…ए…जहाँ ये हर्फ-ए-मूकर्रिर नहीं हूँ मैं।"
…मिजां गालिब
In an interview, Shama once said, “literature represents that dangerous area where it is impossible not to go too far” (in Tense Past, Tense Present: Women Writing in English, joel
Kuortti (ed), Stree, 2004).
For many others, especially younger writers, who were encouraged, by the recent fillip Indian writing has received since the 19805, to put pen to paper or merely to 'finger exercise' on
a keyboard, Shama Futehally was an ever—present, unfailing source of encouragement. In this way too, she was different from writers, published and well established who were too

self—absorbed or engrossed in their own writing. In the world of Indian writing in English, where a rigid glass ceiling — decided on the basis of works picked up by foreign publishing
houses and literary agencies, of huge advances, of life divided between 'here' and abroad (in so—called 'exile') - divided writers from those merely aspiring or the strugglers, Shama
Futehally somehow stood apart. An astute judge and critic, Shama played the role of a guiding light to younger writers. She was always a phone call or email away, an ever present

source of support in the indifferent world of writing, in which success can sometimes and too easily appear a function derived from good marketing and hardsell.
Those who knew her will miss her grace, her quiet courage, and her undiminished cheerfulness even in pain. Her readers will miss her self-deprecatory humour and her gentle and

astute Observances of human behaviour.
