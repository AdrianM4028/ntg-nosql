Director’s Note
The images I had in mind while writing the play
have undergone changes in the course of Production work. It is only in the rehearsal process that
I evolved a form exploiting the talents of the actors from them, improvised sequences and the

props and scenic elements that were added later
to the production. It is presented here more as an
excercise in imparting training to the new corners

to theatre than as a director is polished work. In
other words, the emphasis was on the means of
making theatre than on the end product. An ef—
fort has also been made to exploit the theatrical
elements embedded in the singing of a ballad. The
two Dasis in the play, Manickavalli and
Chempavalak kali are portrayed as deities to

show how myth and legends are created out of

individuals who fought for personal moral codes
and convictions. The social dimension of their personal dilemma is what is relevant to us today.
