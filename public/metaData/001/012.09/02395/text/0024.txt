conspiracy,

concerns

itself

political

with

the

ambition

and

self-aggrandizement.

When a

small man desires what he does

not deserve,

and

can

not have, he has_no way but to resort to intrigues)cunning
and conspiracy

to attain what he must.

With the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. democracy
came

to

an

end

in

Rome

and

history

desecration of democratic ideals
revolution of the 18th century.

Ironically,

Caesar

democracy be served.

In "Julius Caesar” we also witness the‘

machinations

self-serving

of

a

Cassius

and

how

patriotic and self-effacing

Brutus. One man's personal ambition becomes the undoing of a
nation,

and

in

no

destroys

the

concept

of

democracy for centuries.

And

as

so

happens

in

history

political

changes

uninspired by considerations of social good and human values
only achieve the replacement of one set of cousins by
another set of cousins. Caesar is assassinated by Brutus and

Cassius,who are fighting for the preservation of democracy.
Brutus and Cassius are led to commit suicide by Antony and
Octavius,
the
avengers
of Caesar‘s
death.
Eventually,
Octavius becomes Emperor.

And so the Whirligig of time goes on and great causes like
demOCracy are interpreted through motivations of personality
and the chess-game of power politics.
