"Measure for Measure" is a play which arouses questions in ones
mind than answers to them. The first scene itself is strange because
the Duke having ruled a corrupt government for fourteen years decides
to hand over charge of the state to Angelo, his deputy and goes out
into the world. Now! going out into the world for what? For Votes? If
so, how could he get them? Was exposing Angelo a scam of some
sought which would get the Duke back to power?

One has only tries to look at these questions and I would be wrong if
I do not thank the people who helped me looking at these questions.
Lushin Dubey as a friend and a producer for making this production
possible for us and Rangvasundhara for presenting our group and
helping us with many other production problems. Last but not the
least I am thankful to Rati Barthlomew for having suggested this play
to me.
