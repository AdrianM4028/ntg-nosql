smug—Fr AGREDOOT

T h e G ro u p

AGRéDOOT is one of the younger theatre groups of Delhi having a few productions to its credit. Since our inception in 1969 our endevour has been to present
more shows of each of our productions so that more people could see them and
we hope, enjoy them as much as we enjoy presenting them.
Our maiden venture was Surendra Gulati’s Shabaash Anarka/i followed by two
of Badal Sircar's plays Ek The Raja and Kavi Kahani. We are glad that we
could do a good number of shows of each of these plays. We started this
season with two short plays by Vijay Tendulkar, Kagzi Kartoos and Kaayar
in September 1972. We are grateful to the Delhi audience for their spontaneous
response to these plays.

Not many groups have ventured to produce short plays on Delhi stage in
recent years. Alongwith our short plays we also sponsored Theatre Unit
Bombay in Satyadev Dubey's production of Hayavadana.
It now gives us great pleasure in presenting Aasman Se Gira, Hindi version of
Manohar Katdare's popular Marathi play ‘Ghetale Shingavar'. We are
particularly happy that Sai Paranjpye and Arun Joglekar have associated
themselves with us by producing this play for Agredoot.
