The

The "Eternal Search” which

G r0 u p

Agredoot makes for comedies in

Hindi which are

stage-worthy,

is always fruitless.
For the last four years we have been producing translations from the
original Bengali or Marathi. Not that we have any regrets. As a matter of fact, we are proud
that we have been able to show the Delhi audience some of the good comedies written in
regional languages. But, all the same, we would also like to produce comedies originally
written in Hindi.
Perhaps we have not been an incentive enough, which is understandable.
But should it be
understood that Marathi or Bengali Playwrights have greater incentives? lf having their
plays being staged in Hindi can also be taken as an incentive, then is it not possible
that good comedies in Hindi may also be translated into regional languages - some day .7
Howsoever, can we, through this note, attract the attention of our Hindi Playwrights .7

It is a great pleasure for us to stage Vijay Tendulkar's "Koyal Bole Kaien Kaien", originally
entitled in Marathi as "Kawalyanchi Shala." We take this opportunity to congratulate
Mr. Tendulkar for winning the Nehru Fellowship Award (1973) for playwrighting.

Our gratitude to those who have associated themselves for the first time with Agredoot, including

Sushma Ahuja, Vinod Dikshit, Parveen Talha, Sudhir Pareek, Girish Mathur and Maheshwar Dayal.
