Your eyes for the blind

â€” after your life

Your eyes are precious
for you, as long as you live.

They can be more precious
after your life-time,
if you so will.

After serving for a life-time,
your eyes can help a blind
man to see and live more
fruitfully than otherwise.

It is for you to help such
a cause. Many have donated
their eyes for use after their end.

You can also donate your
eyes today at the
nearest Eye Bank.
