^6रिहै००झा8 one of the younger theatre groups of Delhi, launched with the
objective of promoting and encouraging the practice and . knowledge of theatre.‘
Since 1969 we have presented only three plays to the Delhi audience;
Surendra Gulati's Shaabaash Anarkali, and Badal Sircar's Ek Tha Raja and
Kavi Kahani, but we are happy that we have been able to do a good number
of shows of each of our plays. Shaabaash Anarkali has had a run of 17 shows
including our performances in Calcutta and Kanpur and now we are to perform three rnore shows in Bombay in November 1972, under the aegis of the
Theatre Unit. Ek Tha Raja

had continous shows for 5 days,

a somewhat new

experiment then in the Delhi theatre, and 12 shows of Kavi Kahani. Our endeavour will be to present more and more shows of every play we produce so
that more people can see and enjoy our productions.
We are very happy to present 2 Short Plays by Vijay Tendulkar, one of the
very well-known Indian play wrights. We are also happy that Mr. Rajinder Nath,
one of the better known producers of Delhi, has accepted our offer to produce
one of these plays. Our Group producer, Mr. Dina Nath is producing the other.
For the ﬁrst time, we are sponsoring a group to perform for us and it is a
matter of pride that it happens to be the Theatre Unit, Bombay with a play which
has received national recognition — the Kamladevi Chatopadhya Award —
Girish Karnad’s ‘Hayavadana’.
We welcome the producer, Satyadev Dubey and his troupe to
look forward to our continued relationship with them.
