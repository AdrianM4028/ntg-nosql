In a kingdom there lived two wonderful, accomplished men.

One was a scholar

and a poet and the other an athlete and a warrior. They were both great friends.
The scholar one day fell in love. The athlete helped him to get married. They
lived happily for a while. And then the course of the story changes.
The girl starts liking the athletic body and feels sad that her husband is a
weakling. The three start for a distant place and on the way they stop.
The scholar goes to the temple of Kalimata and the girl and athlete go to the
temple of Rudrajee. The scholar remembers a promise he had made to Kalirnata
and he offers his head in sacriﬁce. The athlete discovers the body and offers
his head in grief. The girl comes to the spot and starts wailing for her lover
and his friend. Kalirnata awakens (from a long sleep) and s.uggests a remedy.
She asks the girl to put the severed heads on to the bodies and says that she
would put life into them again. The girl makes a mistake. The two friends
come to life again with transformed heads. The two ﬁght for the identity of the
scholar—for the possession of the girl. The girl says she belongs to the person
with the scholar's head and the athlete's body. The other person with the
dull brain and weak body is left unhappy. But he has the tendency of the athlete
and developes his physique.
