We are back on the theatre scene in Delhi after a lapse of 2 years. But
then this is one of the problems with Amatuer Theatre. It gets bogged
down at times; due to lack of theatre in—puts. We did stage our

ever-green comedy Surendra Gulati's 'SHABAASH ANARKALI’ in
Bombay last year with great success—capacity halls and bumper sales.
(I wish theatre audience in Delhi would also always respond like this!).

Anyway, we hope to be more regular in the future and give our
audience good-rich theatre.

Not very often do we come across a good meaningful comedy, in fact
we are always on a national hunt for such plays and if you have been
a regular Delhi-theatre goer you would have had the opportunity to see

some good comedies produced by us and written originally in one of
the many Indian languages l\/lanoj lVlitra's ’RAJ DARSHAN' being
staged by us as 'NAND RAJA IVIASTH HAI' in Hindi is having a very
successful run since the past one year in its original Bengali at
Calcutta There were other aspirants for Mr. Mitra’s script for staging

the play in Hindi. I am glad he chose us. We would have hated the idea
of losing an opportunity to stage a good play.

We have been very fortunate in having different directors to come
and take assignments with us. It is with great pleasure that we
welcome Ranjit Kapoor. To say the least, we are honoured, he has
taken up the assignment with us and although he is going to shuttle
plays
as of now between Bombay 8 Delhi, we hope he shall direct more
for us in the future.
