the play,

Surendra Gulati’s ‘Phanda' is based on a story by Agatha Christie ‘Three Blind Mice'.
This story was drarnatised for the stage a long time ago and has been running in London
for more than 20 years as ‘Mouse Trap'.

We do hope you will enjoy it.

Please do not

disclose the mystery to your friends.

There are eight of them—six men and two women trapped in a snow bound house.
One among them is a killer— who has struck once and will strike again and again.
