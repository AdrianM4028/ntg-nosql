Palekar’s very successful and novel

production in

Marathi which made it sound all the more exciting. That we will actually
produce ‘Kaddu' and that also directed by Amol himself seemed a remote

possibility at one time, but then there it is.

Amol feels that if at all this play is to be labelled, he will at best call it

theatre of the absurd. It may be a very different experience, all the same

a lot to all of us.

We are fortunate that Amol could ﬁnd time to accept our invitation to
direct this play for us inspite of his busy theatre and ﬁlm schedules.
