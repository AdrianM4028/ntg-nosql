STATION C L EA N

There is no denying that clean surroundings mirror the
character of an individual and mould our attitude. Such
surroundings radiate joy.
We keep our homes spick and span. Why not practise
the same in public places also?
On railway platforms, in waiting rooms, in carriages,
and, in fact, anywhere where people gather in large
numbers it is of paramount importance that surroundings are maintained clean.
We on the railways, have launched a cleanliness drive

which has produced handsome results. The railways
wear a more presentable look. We, however, realise

much more needs to be done. We shall relentlessly
strvie to do better.
You can also help railways. Keep station and the

adjacent places clean by taking care that areas around
you are in perfect condition. Why not utilise the
services of the railway sanitary staff. They are there
to serve you.

On your own part please do not allow litter to be
thrown except in dust bins. Every small act will help
us serve you better.

Railways are your property. Keep it clean.
