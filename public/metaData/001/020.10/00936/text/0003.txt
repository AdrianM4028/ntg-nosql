Short plays have not been very popular with the Delhi theatre
groups in recent years. During the last season, when we were in
search of plays, we came across many one-act plays written by
well-known playwrights. As such, we took up for production.
Vijay Tendulkar’s two short plays, “KAAYAR” and “KAGZI
KARTOOS”, in September 1972. The spontaneous response we
got from our audience has prompted us to produce short plays,
again this year.

Amitabh Chakrabarti is a young, comparatively little known playwright. His play, “TIMIR” has been inspired by the famous Polish
playwright, Slawomir Mrozeck's “CHARLIE”. Many of us will ﬁnd
Amitabh's other play, “KHOJ” an unusual experience. We welupcome Avik Ghosh, the director of “TlMlR” -— another bright,
for}
coming producer of Delhi, and the many new faces who appear
current
AGREDOOT for the ﬁrst time. We hope you will judge our
g
gainin
for
production as we have judged them — an investment
experience and encouraging fresh talent.
