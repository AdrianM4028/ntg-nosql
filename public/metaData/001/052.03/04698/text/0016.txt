DIRECTOR'S NOTE

always strive to experiment with new ideas and
techniques while directing children‘s plays for ‘Kalsootri'. I
also try to base my plays on educational values. My
endeavour is always to attain education through
entertainment and that is exactly what I have tried to do in
"Chamatkar Hokar Rehega". This play is inspired, on story
by world-renowned novelist Roald Dahl. 1 asked leading
Marathi playwright Ratnakar Matkari to write a children's
play based on this story.
In this computer age 1 have tried to present a play using
magic and devising a form akin to black comedy, by using
humorous techniques. 1 think it is essential that we do not
make a fuss about elaborate techniques and try to present
a simple story to bring out what we want. That is what 1 like.
1 can present my play in a large, elaborate, modern, fullyequiped state—of—the—art theatre and also in any open space
almost anywhere, even in a class-room. And this
requirement dictates the style for me. 1 want to reach out to
as many children as I can. And 1 try to bring across the
message 1 want to give to young audiences.
