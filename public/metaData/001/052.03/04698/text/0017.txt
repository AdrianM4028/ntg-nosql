SYNOPSIS OF THE PLAY

Chandani is a girl who has just joined school. Her
father sells old cars and swindles customers. Her mother
is interested only in watching TV and dressing herself up.
But Chandani is brilliant and fond of reading. Her classteacher Mr. Dubey recognizes this but her head-mistress
is indifferent.

Chandani hates injustice and conjures up miracles
whenever she comes across such callous behaviour. These
miracles help in setting things right. The dictatorial head—
mistress is taught a lesson.

The play uses song and dance and magic to bring home
the message of ’READ, READ, READ.

’

All man are creative but few are artists
