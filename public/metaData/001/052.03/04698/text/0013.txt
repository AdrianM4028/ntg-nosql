DIRECTOR स

t times while breathing one shockingly realizes that

we are breathing in the valley of poisonous air. And often
we avoid to note the crucial inter-relationship between
air—breath-life and carry on with living just habitually.
It is time that we better realize this self—decieving attitude;
is the focus of the play ‘TULSI...TULSI'.
Treating in a playful atmosphere, the first part of the play
deals with Tulsi's fondliness towards plants in her immediate environment. The second part under lines the concern of Tulsi regarding the fact of missing and fading
away of greens (the world of plants) from our lives. Fi—,
nally, the last part tries to reason out about Tulsi's priorities due to her conflicting love for toys as well as plants.
In a novel presentation style the play aims to make chil—
dren participate during the school shows to resolute what
they would do if they are put in Tulsi's place?
