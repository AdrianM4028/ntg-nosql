apparently unrelated incident. It may also emerge when the mind,
driven to desperation with all exits barred, finds the courage to
squarely confront itself.
Such realization transforms the lives of the principal characters in

miracle worker, becomes the focus of search for people with problems
of unfulfilled dreams. He may or may not grant every wish, but eveyone
looks up to him, for he symbolizes Hope which dwells eternally in the
human breast and eggs us on to fulfillment or frustration.
The Himalayas, towering in their splendour behind the roadside lodge,
where pilgrims to Badrinath spend the night, represent the Eternal and
the Timeless. Aloof and forbidding and yet directly affecting the viewer
by their stirring beauty, they have a quality which irnpells the
characters to turn the mind inwards and see into the nature of life and
into their own selves.

Guilt and remorse runs like a refrain through the lives of three of the
principal characters. Several aspects of the man-woman relationship
are explored. Also the nature of love.
The play concludes with a keertan but it is not a religious play, except
in a very restricted sense. Religion provides the comfort of ritual and
faith, which means certainty. For some that is the end of the road. Not
for the characters in the play. Doubts are cleared, solutions emerge,
paths are indicated, but for the rest of the journey. each has to be his or
h e r own guide.
