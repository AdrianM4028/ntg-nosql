about the play
‘ ‘ R Ad N I - G A N D H A’ ’
The right woman and the wrong man, the wrong woman
and the right man are more often than not brought
together so that the two ideal halves rarely meet to
complement each other, Most of us are square pegs in
round holes often struggling hard to pursue an ever
fleeting goal of happiness. The callous instruments of
destiny conspire against us and we are tossed helplessly

like straws on the crest of huge waves of ocean. Everything eliides our grasp. ' We are overwhelmed with
mighty waves yet we remain thirsty, waiting and watching aid longing for the desired moment. RAJNI GANDHA
unfolds similar spectacle.
The realities of a miserable woman's drab existence
lead her through the path of eternal conflict of emotions.
Man after man tries to engulf her for the satisfaction
of his own

individual

emotions.

The

poor woman

hungers for love, sincerity and a spirit of selflessness.

Disillusioned at each step‘ she craves for something that
may console her bruised heart.
At long last a man enters her life, the man who realised
in her the identification of her dream girl. The moment
the mystery of this man’s innermost recesses of heart
is reVealed to the woman, she is simply overwhelmed.

an immense ioy which is too much for her to contain.

The frail vessel of emotions breaks under the weight of
