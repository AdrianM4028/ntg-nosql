A word about
THEATRE

PANORAMA

1T is now a period of more than ten years since THEATRE PANORAMA has been ’
making its humble contribution to the ﬁeld of Indian Arts and Culture. We
believe that it is our sincerity of purpose alone that has enabled this amateur and

non-professional organisation to survive all sorts of impediments that cropped up in
its path. The recognition that this organisation has been receiving fromthe people of
Delhi has always inspired us.

In fact it has been our biggest consolation.

During this period we were called upon to contribute our mite to TAGORE

and MOTI LAL NEHRU CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS. The plays and
programmes subsequently staged by us were witnessed and admired by Union
Ministers Shri Jagjivan Ram, Shri Satya Narain Sinha, Shri B. S. Murthy, Executive
Councillors of Delhi Shri A. C. Subh and Dr. Ram Lal Verma.

Another blessed opportunity presented itself before us when a Troup of
artists of Theatre Panorama sponsored by the Ministry of Defence visited the NEF'A
and ASSAM Border areas with a cultural programme to entertain Indian Jawans.

Since than we got opportunities of presenting plays ‘Bahadur Shah, Zaf'ar’ and
‘Dhai Akhar Prem Ka’ at RASHTRAPATI BHAWAN before the distinguished
presence of Dr. S. RADHAKRISHNAN the Ex-President of India and LATE
Dr. ZAKIR HUSAIN.

Recently during an ALL INDIA DRAMA COMPETITION our Director
Shri Surendra Mathur was given the SECOND BEST DIRECTOR AWARD for
the Punjabi Play “Gallan Piyar Diyan”.
Union Education Minister.

The Award was given by V. K. R. V. Rao,

We are pledged to art and would Spare no pains to serve it.
Kindly accept our cordial thanks for your kind visit to this show that we are
presenting on great public demand.
