(MINOR RE A MUSICAL NO’E)
AN ADAPTATION OF MARGUERITE‘. DURAS " LA MUS ICA”

§.__s_गुस्साoP5 IS
A divoiced, upper middle class couple, Pnita and.Vicky
Sinha meet in the foyer of a hotel after two years of seperation
as the initial unease and nonchalance fades, the couple find
themselves drawing nearer and nearer the other.

is a difference.

But there

Their "hellish" past is the chasm into

which they now find themselves drawn into, once more.

The

play tries to give, perhaps from the woman‘s point of View
as feministfs might say, the transformation that takes place
in a woman once the "intuitive" and warmth of the man—woman
relation is destroyed.

Their estranged communication had

led to many prevarications and lies.

Now as they meet, once

more drawn to that terrifying evil in their past world, the
woman cries out in despair "I don't want my life a third
Act."
There are no conventional answers in the play.

It is

sombre in mood and tries to capture the modern world in which
the breakdown of old values lead to seperation and sorrow.
This is the dominant motif.
