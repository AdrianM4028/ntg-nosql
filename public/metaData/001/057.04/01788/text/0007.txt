social milieu where politicians are

three plays together also brings into a single focus the historical
process of India's decadence. But these social parasites are relentlessly pursued by haunting fears and nemesis is their ultimate due.

DIRECTOR’S NOTE
(a)

Appropriate selections from Bharatendu’s plays—Andher Nagri,

In presenting this synthetic selection out of Bharatendu’s

of his characters a local habitation in which they are as vital
and as meaningful as in their original dwellings.
