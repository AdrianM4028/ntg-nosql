rat.

Jungle Tantrarn is the story of lion, snake, pea-cock and the
All of them are in the service of Shiva, Parvati and Ganesh.

Once they start quarreling with each other and are cursed by Shiva
to go on earth.

When they reach earth, the lion declares himself the king,
appoints pea-cock as his administrator, snake as the representative
of the merchant class and the rat is left to suffer as a common

man.

From here onwards the story revolves round the struggles
of each individual to win over the rat to his side so that he may
capture the power. Thus it becomes a biting satire on the present
democratic system in any country.

The entire novel is written as a fantasy but with an absolute contemporary relevance.

My work in theatre relates to stage presentation of stories _
and novels. During the last eleven years I have produced sixty
stories and eight novels on stage with different groups and in diffe—
rent languages all over India.

The present project is also a step forward in that direction.
Uptil now l have staged stories and novels without making them
plays. But this time I intend to adapt a novel into a play and then
put it on stage. Thus this process will provide an opportunity to
study my own previous work in relation to the present production.

As the novel itself is based on the format of the Panchtantra tales, therefore, I intend to use the different forms of traditional art of story-telling prevalent in different parts of India. This
does not mean that these elements will be used just for decoration but it has to be noted that they will become a coherent
element of the total production.

Moreover, this is also clear before

me that I am not a revi-

of folk/traditional theatre forms. As long as they are not
co-related to the training and method of modern actor, they become
