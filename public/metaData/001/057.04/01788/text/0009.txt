SY N O PS l S
The play, “Baba Jitto", is based on

a folk tale which took

place in the first half of the fifteenth century. A poor peasant,
Jitto fled from his village to escape harassment and exploitation

by his relatives. He alongwith his 9-year-daughter took refuge
in the house of his friend living in a nearby village, 'Shamachak'
located

in

in the southern part

getting a piece

of Jammu.

of land from a

Baba Jitto

local landlord

succeeds

through the

efforts of his friend. The landlord allowed him to cultivate the
land on the condition of getting on-third of the total produce.

Sustained efforts of Jitto resulted in the conversion of the
barren piece of land to a flowing sea of granary. The feudal
lord on seeing the rich crop becomes greedy and plans to take
home the whole of the produce. Accordingly, his rnusclernen come
to plunder the crop. But the hapless Jitto commits suicide with
a dagger sitting on the stacks of the crop. The rnusclernen
carry away the wheat drenched in blood. The tiny daughter of
Jitto immolates herself by jumping on her father’s pyre.
It

was after

this incident

that all those who consumed
blood-soaked wheat started having the fits of “Jater”. It is in
this context that a big fair popularly known as “Jhiri Mela" is
held in the month of October at the place where Jitto made
supreme sacrifice.

DIRECTOR’S NOTE
The

narration

of

the

play

is

based

on

'KARKAN’_

traditionally, the story of ’BABA JlTTO' and other ballads are

narrated by ‘KARKAN'—in the hilly areas of Jammu region. In
the opening scene and after Baba Jitto’s sacrifice, l have made
use

of

’JATER'

and ’JARIAN'—traditional
musical
notes
which are used to call supernatural powers. In another sequence,
when Jitto's aunt and her seven sons succeed in pushing Jitto
out from the village, I have made use of GEETRU—a folk form
of dance and music. The elements of HERN, KUD, and SAUIAN
are also used. The whole production is not confined to these
forms, but the idea is to find out a contemporary theatre idiom
inspired by these forms.
