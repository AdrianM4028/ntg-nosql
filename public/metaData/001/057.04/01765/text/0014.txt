The so called friends come. divert
her attention and leave her in lurch:
Roopa attracts her vision to the world
of objects. kindling desire after desire;
Gandha attracts her to fragrance,
tilling baser qualities; Sabda results in
her adherence to wrong advice; Rasa

instigates indiscriminate eating.
drinking and drugging; Sparsa seduces.
The friends are not in the control of
the Heroine; they empty her basket of
ﬂowers. which are all gathered through
self effort of this girl in rags. The mid
day Sun laughs at her.
When the Senses are not under the
control of the Buddhi. the result is
diversion from the path of Dharma.
For. these Senses distract the Buddhi.
ending in loss of ‘Punya ', equanimity
and self-restraint. earned by one who is
already suffering from spiritual poverty.
The mid day Sun signiﬁes the middle
age.

In the evening. her eyes are drowsy.
Men returning home heckle her. She is
like a beggar in shame. unable to
answer the questions of her friends.
How can she say that her Lover has
promised to come? How can she
disclose that poverty is her’ only dowry?
As the evening of her life
approaches. Buddhi is ashamed of itself
for not having used discrimination and
allowing the Senses to wander and
dominate. Now the Senses turn back
and question the Buddhi which ~
hesitates to tell them that it is waiting
for Self Realisation and that it is still
not equipped for it, due to spiritual
poverty.

At last the Lover comes in all his
splendour in a chariot with golden
ﬂags. The Heroine's friends are looking
aghast; the Lover takes this girl in
dusty rags by his side; she is full of
mixed feelings. But alas l this is just a
d re a m .

The Bliss of Self Realisa tion is only
experienced in the state of Swapna

(dream) and not While the Buddhi is
awake (Jaagrat).
Time does not halt; the Lover does
not hear her cries. in the midst of all

paraphernalia. she is alone and silent

— detached from all the din. There is
no symptom of his arrival. Will he
always hide in the shadow of the ﬁve
men? With ﬁrm determination. she
dedicates her loving longing and
devotional tears to her Lover and
decides to wait for him endlessly in any
number of births.

She forgets herself totally and soaks
herself in devotion. Now she receives
and enjoys the all pervading voice
within her.
' Costumes

Bealisation of the Self cannot be
achieved through Buddhi alone; it is
not a mere intellectual exercise. but
much beyond that. Only when the ego
of the Buddhi is totally drowned in
devotion. the al/ pervading Naada
Brahmmam (Pranava) is heard from
within.
