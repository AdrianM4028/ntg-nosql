Dak-Ghar (The Post-Office) is a playlet
by Rabindranath Tagore, ﬁrst staged

on 1 0th October 191 O at Bichitra
Bhavan. and ﬁrst published in 1912. It
belongs to the allegorical—symbolical
genre with a necessary touch of reality.
Amal. the hero of the play, is a sick
child. Madhab Datta. his foster father.
thinks that Amal is a stranger to his

family and it is very difﬁcult to save his
life. The doctor (Kabiraj) thinks that
the outer wind. the autumn sun and
the dampness are harmful to the ailing
boy. Accordingly Amal is conﬁned to a
room and not allowed to go outside.
But the boy has a powerful
imagination and a strong sense of
beauty. He looks at the outer world
from the window of his room and is
charmed by the colourful spectacle of
life. He sees a curd—seller coming from
a distant village near the hills. the
watchman going on his beat. a little
girl passing by with a basket of ﬂowers
and children playing nearby. All these
make Amal joyous and fanciful. He
discovers romance in- the daily

activities of the people. He also invests
them with his romantic longing. Day
by day Amal enjoys all these things and
pines for the far-away. He is so
sensitive that he can see the King’s
postman coming down the hillside.
Thakurda informs Amal of the Statephysician (Raj-vaidya) under whose

treatment he will be completely cured.
He also assures him of the letter from
the King. At the end of the play the
Royal Physician comes at midnight.
The doors and windows of Amal‘s
room are all thrown open. Amal is

comforted by the touch of the Royal
Physician and falls asleep. He is
apparently dead. The boy gets his
moment of union with the King or
God.

The play moves on two planes.
Outwardly in the story of Amal there is
the yearning of the mind for things
afar. But there is also a deeper
meaning underneath. It suggests the
yearning of the soul. In the light of the
spiritual signiﬁcance Amal is an allegory
of the human soul. As our soul is a
stranger to this world. so Amal has

connection with none. Madhab stands
for a worldly—wise man. The headman
is symbolic of a blind society devoid of
great ideal. high thought and aim of
life. Amal gets a call from the King to
go home. Thakurda is a connecting link
between the human soul and the
greater soul. At the ripe moment. the
Royal Physician brings the message of
emancipation and Amal is in union
with God. So the shadow of death
cannot darken the play.
