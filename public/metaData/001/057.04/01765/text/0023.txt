DI RECTOR'S NOTE
The play is based on a well-known
short story of Tagore. A young tax
collector decides against the advice of
his clerk Karim Khan to stay in a
haunted palace which was once the
pleasure resort of Shah Mahmud the
Second. Here he confronts the spirit of
an Iranian girl who had resisted the
amorous advances of the king and was
made to suffer for this. The collector is
soon under the spell of the spirit. This
experience of the world of the dead
pushes him to the verge of insanity till
he is made to leave the palace by the
wellâ€”intentioned Karim Khan.

The use of Tagore's poems has given
an added dimension to the production.
helping to bring to the fore the various
thematic levels of the evocative story.
In essence the play is poetic. The
production employs Kathak and
associated music to meet its artistic
ends.
