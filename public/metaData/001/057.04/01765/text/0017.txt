DIRECTOR'S NOTE
The Manipuri version of Haja (please
see synopsis on p4.) is an
attempt to interpret the
transformation of the human being in
relationship with God. The play is
presented in the idiom of Manipur's
primitive tribal lore and ritual. The
attempt to reach the inﬁnite from the
ﬁnite world is represented by the trials
of the young queen. whose earthly
passions are sublirnated through an

agonizing process of self-awareness.
The queen's desire to see her lord.
thwarted by the mysterious play of
divine power. are worked out in the

ritualistic world-view of the tribals of
north-east India.
in the lore of Manipur also there is
the myth of a queen who misses her
husband by day because he is divine.
and is able to feel his presence only at
night. This is subtly incorporated in the
structure of the production. The king
or God is projected as manifest in all
actions. characters and situations in
the play. yet the people are unaware of
his presence. His energy is manifest in

those He blesses (Thakurda and '
Surangarna) and equally in the
intrigues of manipulators like Kanchi.
All experience is an aspect of His
manifestation.
This is interpreted in terms of the
tribal/ritual world of the primitive
Meitei and associated communities.
Zeliangroung dance. music and ritual
are incorporated in the production. To
portray Tagore's concept of salvation
in tribal/ritual terms. much freedom is

taken with the text of the play. The
दृ twists and turns in the original are
pruned down to a simple narrative.
The transformation of the individual
in relation with God's will was treated
on two planes by Tagore. For the
queen it was personal. an agonizing
process of self-awareness growing from
within. For Kanchi, the schemer. it was

externally enforced. with a show of the
power and grace of the King. The two
separate transformations have been
highlighted in tribal/ritual form. the
play translated into a plain tribal
drama of Manipur.
