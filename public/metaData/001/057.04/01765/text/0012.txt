CHOREOGRAPHER'S NOTE
Prarthana is based on a poem from
Gitary'ali — the poet's prayer for the
awakening of his country:
Where the mind is without fear
and the head is held high.-

Where knowledge is free,-

है

l/Wrere the world is not broken up

Into fragments by narrow
domestic walls:
Where words come out from the depth
of truth:
Where tireless striving stretches
its arms

Towards perfection:

Where the clear stream of reason

Has not lost its way

Into the dreary desert sand of dead
habit:
Where the mind is led forward by thee

Into ever widening thought and
action
Into that heaven of freedom. my
father.
Let my country awake.

The poem was written at the turn

of the century. Its historical context
was the ferment and anxiety of
impending war and emergent
nationalism in India.

The dance is divided into eight
sections conveying the poet's vision
through images. symbols and
choreographic patterns. The many
abstract visions have been given
symbolic representation. The phrases
mind without fear. knowledge, brokenup world. words of truth. tireless
striving, dead habits, ever widening
thought and action and heaven of
freedom sounded beautiful in poetry
but needed a tangible form in dance.
Sometimes the form emerges from
the process of rehearsal -— watching
the dancers' interpretation. the
character given to particular
movement ideas. The poem has been
given visual form. with no spoken
word. and the choreography integrated
with the scenic design. music.
costumes and lighting.
