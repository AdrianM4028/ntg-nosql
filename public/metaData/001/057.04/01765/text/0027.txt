CHOREOGRAPHER'S NOTE
Bhanusingher Padabali represents
Tagore's earliest poems. published at
sixteen under the pseudonym
Bhanusingh. Written in a mix of
Bengali and Brajbhasha. the poems are
on the Radha—Krishna theme. The
dance-drama has been composed
around these poems. The Sancharis
introduced are an extension of the

lyrics which reﬂect the sanctity of
Vaishnava belief'and devotion.
Though the music is in the
inimitable style of Tagore, the
Angikabhinay is in the Bhangi of
classical Odissi. Typical Odissi rhythmic
compositions have been married to the
melody to give the dance a strong

Odissi ﬂavour.
