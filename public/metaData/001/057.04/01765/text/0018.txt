Aryan Theatre
Among the oldest theatres of Manipur.
Aryan Theatre was established in 1935
under the leadership of the late
Panditraj Atornbapu Vidyaratna. Men
like Haobam lbungeyaima.
Khumanthem Madhumangol.

‘Thongbam Gokulchandra. Arambam
Dorendrajit. Mayanglambam
Birarnangol. etc. gave the theatre its
distinctive character. Some 120 plays
have been produced by Aryan Theatre.
and many Manipuri playwrights have
emerged under its banner. The theatre
reﬂects a concern for indigenous forms
of expression and attempts to explore
avenues for Manipuri theatre to
develop on ethnic lines.
Since 1971 Aryan Theatre has
helped the new alternative theatre in
Manipur to grow. It has lent its
platform freely to struggling theatre
groups and arranged festivals and
seminars to. help the new theatre ﬁnd
its feet. Most of the well—known
experimental theatre groups in
Manipur have been associated with
Aryan Theatre. The theatre has been
concerned with producing plays which
reﬂect the deeper tensions and sociohistorical complexities of contemporary
Manipur. Since its plays were not of
commercial mould. the productions
were never regular. The theatre is now
working out research—oriented
productions for a fresher approach in
this ﬁeld.
