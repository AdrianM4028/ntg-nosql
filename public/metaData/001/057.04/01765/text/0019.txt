1 have tried to place Prakriti in a
historical context where her passion.
rebellion. and self-realization are the
basis of a collective protest and
movement against caste dogma. She
never asks forgiveness. butjustiﬁes her

evolution. Ananda the Bhikshu is~ not

message that works upon Prakriti.
becoming physical passion for an
isolated moment only in her psyche.
Ananda's idea is what moves Prakriti
and her community to action.
Prakriti's desire. on the other hand. is
part of her process of self-realization.
Thus. the rituals of Maya the mother

and her Bhairavis take on images of
rites of passage. with Prakriti as
initiate being ‘re—bom' as a woman
with mature sexuality —— something
that was never taboo in nonBrahrnanic society. The emphasis in
the production is on three aspects: the
self—reliance and self-respect of the
untouchable woman; the power of
woman in religious spheres outside the
Hindu-Brahmanic domain; and the
force of the oppressed in revolt.

Just as my interpretation attempts

to reassess Tagore's Chanda/Ma by
stressing its universality in the struggle
of the oppressed. the dance technique.
too, has been individually developed
(outside Santiniketan) from the
theoretical framework given by Tagore
that never came to fruition in his
lifetime: a contemporary style evolving

out of the classical tradition. One
hopes here to exemplify the ongoing
process of assimilation and integration
of the essentials of classical form to
create a resource of dance vocabulary
without associated context, to suit
contemporary needs. it is not eclectic.
but what Protima Devi called a
‘chemical synthesis‘.
One of the problems l faced in
choreography was the rich and thick
imagery of Tagore's poetry: the lack of

‘sanchari bhava' curtailed its full
expression in dance. For this reason 1
have made ample use of pure music

and pure drums. And edited freely.
although the sequence and the words.
both spoken and sung. are entirely the
poet's. Dialogue has been used to
emphasize the strong personalities of
mother and daughter which are more
in evidence in the play than in the
dance-drama. In addition to speciﬁc
characters. all the dancers represent
various forces at work in the story:
nature. weather changes. underearth
serpent powers. the strength and
power of the untouChable worker. the
social cruelties and oppressiveness

hidden behind accepted custom and
beauty. The very names of the main
two characters —— Prakriti and Maya
— reveal the symbolism inherent in
Tagore's own interpretation.
