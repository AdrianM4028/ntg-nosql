'Go-Grahanam’ is the story of woman in a male chauvinist
society.She had the compulsion to suffer and adjust the rnillenia
of mistreatment. The play reveals and deals with various facts
and facets of woman’s life in the society, living systems and

psychological set-up, from birth to womanhood. ‘Go-grahanam’
is a ‘docudrama' with a charge and is an enacted accusation.

Traditionally woman is always compared to ‘Go~Mata’ (cow),
which is the symbol of treasure and captive. Both these con~
cepts are interwoven in ‘Go~Grahanam’. The play is based on
an aligorical story, taken from a folk legend.

Folk elements from 'OGGUKATHA’ - a popular folk theatre
form prevalent in Telengana (Andhra Pradesh), are chosen,
specially for narrative purposes. Sutradhar and chorus stress on
the circumstances in the play- and link, mostly the episodes.
Another folk motif is drawn from ‘Pulivesham’ (guise of tiger)
here tiger stands as a symbol for the cruel chauvinist male pig.

The play creates a montage of different characters in terms
of a series of environments where the characters take their
roles to suit the environment and play the character.
