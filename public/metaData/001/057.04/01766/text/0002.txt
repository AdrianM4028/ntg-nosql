दुष्टच्छातृड्डेड्ड.
Queen Sudarshana meets her king only in a dark chamber.

As the King cannot be seen in the darkness, Sudarshana pines to
see him.

And she wants to see him in the way she sees all

material objects.

Surangama, the maid of the dark chamber warns
h e I‘ .
She tells Sudarshana that it is in the depth of the heart
that the king summons her, and hence it is there that she gets
to know him.
Unless Sudarshana realises him properly, she is
likely to be deceived , and illusion may then pass as real
.
Sudarshana being intent on seeing him, the King relents,
agreeing to appear among the multitudes thronging his gardens to

celebrate the Spring festival; the queen would have to seek
him out on her own.

His subjects have never seen the King.
Confused as
they are, they seek answers from Thakurda, who like Surangama
is capable of sensing the presence of the King.
A number of kings arrive for the Spring festival,

Kanchiraj the cleverest of them all.
He sees through the
imposture of Subarna, who has been trying to pass off as the
King.
Being eager to possess the beautiful Sudarshana,
Kanchiraj decides to use Subarna.
