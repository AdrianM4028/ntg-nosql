Bharat Rang Mahotsav 2005
SN: - 20m January

India is among the world's largest nations having a vast and contrasting land bordered on the north and east by the Himalayan mountain

ranges, on the west by the great Thar desert and with the southern half of the country a peninsula surrounded by the Arabian Sea on one side
and the Bay of Bengal on other. Because of its strategic location, Indian civilization has been shaped over time by a multitude of social,
political and religious forces which, inturn, have had a direct bearing on the shape of its theatre.
The mythological origin of Indian theatre is detailed in the Natya Shastra. Theatre is said to have been the inspiration of Brahma the God of
creation. When the world, was given over to sensual pleasure, Indra, King of the Gods, approached Brahma and asked him to create a form of
diversion that could be seen as well as heard by everyone. Out of his state of meditation, Brahma created Drama (Natya), which he referred to

as a fifth veda or sacred text. Bharat and his sons summoned by him and persuaded to serve as the first actors, which they willingly agreed to

do. The Occasion of the first performance was established to depict and coincide with the defeat of the demons by the Gods, celebrating
Indra's victorious leadership. Thus the very first Drama was staged as part of a festival itself. Later theatre was also performed to celebrate
important religious and other events like a coronation, marriage, birth of a child, the return of a traveler or the defeat of an enemy.

Festivals always come back to hospitality. It's something which is inherent in many cultures, eating together, talking together, mingling
