MESSAGE

National School of Drama is presenting the 7th Bharat Rang Mahotsav from January 5—20, 2005.
The festival will feature theatre productions representing the multifarious cultural, linguistic and
performing traditions of India from the various regions of the country. The festive will also showcase
theatre production of some groups from abroad.
Bharat Rang Mahotsav has been recognised as an important annual regular theatre event by
International Theatre Institute, UNESCO, Paris and its features in the iTi's calender of theatre
CVC n tS .

It is needless to mention that the Mahotsav gives a wide platform to theatre groups to showcase
their productions and also provide the opportunity for the directors, experts and the artistes to meet
and interact with each other.

The festival of this magnitude also has important academic inputs to the students pursuing their
training at the School.

I am happy that the School is honouring two of its distinguished graduates with the 'B.V.
Karanth Smriti Puruskar' and 'Manohar Singh Smriti Puruskar' for their outstanding contributions
in the field of theatre of the inaugural ceremony of the festival.

I hope the festival will be well received by the theatre lovers.
