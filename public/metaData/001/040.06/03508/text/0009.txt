MESSAGE

‘

It is my pleasure to know that National School of Drama (NSD) is
organizing 7th Bharat Rang Mahotsav.

The mythological origin of Indian Theatre is detailed in the Natya
Shastra. Theatre is said to have been the inspiration of Brahma, the God of
creation. In our culture theatre is performed to celebrate important religious
and other events like a coronation, marriage, birth of a child, the return of a
traveler or the defeat of an enemy. Rang Mahotsav is inherent in many
cultures, eating together, mingling together.

On this occasion, I extend my warm greetings and felicitations to all
those associated with the NSD and wish the Rang Mahotsav a grand
S uCCCSS .
