MESSAGE

I am happy to know that the National School of Drama is organising the
7‘h Bharat Rang Mahotsav during January 5—20, 2005.
Theatre is an excellent platform for artists to present their talents to

people and have a mission to inspire society for the establishment of peace
on this beautiful planet of ours. The participation of groups from abroad at
the Mahotsav will also provide an occasion for the audience to have a

glimpse of the cultures of other nations.

On this occasion, I extend my warm greetings and felicitations to the
organisers and the participants and wish the Mahotsav all success.
