National School of Drama presents the 7th Bharat Rang Mahotsav from 5th 20th January, 2005.
Bharat Rang Mahotsav has already registered its strong presence amongst the scores ‘of International
Theatre Festivals and the International Theatre Institute, UNESCO, Paris has also recognized this
Festival as an important theatre event at its 29th Congress held at Athens, Greece in October, 2002.
Seventh Chapter of the Festival features 56 theatre groups from all over the country including
four theatre groups from abroad, such as, Japan, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. The Festival
covers 16 States and 2 Union Territories representing 18 Indian languages and 2 foreign languages

including English.
With participation of more than 20 groups from the Northern region, the focus of 7th BRM is

on the Northern region of the country.
It is a matter of great pleasure for all of us that the School is honouring two of its distinguished
alumni with the 'B.V. Karanth Smriti Puruskar' and 'Manohar Singh Smriti Puruskar' in recognition

of their outstanding contributions in the field of theatre on the inaugural ceremony of the Festival.
The School will be felicitating five eminent theatre persons for their life long devotion and
excellent contribution to theatre on the concluding ceremony of the festival on 20th January 2005.
The coastal areas of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala including Andaman & Nicobar Island

could not escape the fury of Tsunami. There has been a monumental loss of lives and property in
these areas. The entire Nation has arisen for the rehabilitation of the affected people. We, in NSD,
have also pledged to contribute our mite for this noble cause. It has, therefore, been decided that the

proceedings of the 7th Bharat Rang Mahotsav will be donated to the Prime Minister's National
Relief Fund for this cause.
