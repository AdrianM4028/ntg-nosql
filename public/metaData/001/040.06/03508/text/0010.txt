क्या
I am extremely happy that the National School of Drama is organizing the
7th Bharat Rang Mahotsav from January 5—20, 2005. National School of
Drama, a premier institution under Ministry of Culture, has made significant
contribution in the field of theatre for the last 45 years. Bharat Rang Mahotsav,
a National Theatre Festival, started in 1999, as part of the celebrations of the
Golden Jubilee of Indian Independence.

This festival will showcase traditional as well as contemporary and modern
theatre performances from across the country. The Mahotsav has emerged as a
premier event in the cultural life of the country.

The 7th Bharat Rang Mahotsav is featuring 56 theatre groups, representing
various languages and regions of the country, including four productions of
foreign theatre groups. This sixteen days festival will deﬁnitely be a feast for all
theatre lovers.
I wish the 7th Bharat Rang Mahotsav a great success.
