performed is his first, Udd/Jil'ayfa d/Jari/mx/m/a ('Desolate
Dharmashala', 1974, translated as A A1111; [/1 Dark

Timer). It stages a so—called academic inquiry that, in
fact, is an inquisition brought on by the protagonist‘s
left-wing politics.

Deshpande's is a unique presence in Marathi theatre.
Unlike other playwrights, he is not interested in the
psychological and familial problems of the middle
class, but in exploring the effect that ideas and
ideologies have on human life, in which the middle
class receives special attention. Two other issues
inform his writing: the correct representation of

politicians, largely demonized or ridiculed in Marathi
literature and drama, and the recovery of a language of
discourse lost through lack of use. He strongly
criticizes theatre that neglects dialogue. Among his
works, And/Jar रै him (A Passage to Darkness, 187) most

ambitiously attempts to embody these concerns.
He has written the following nine full length plays:
