ROMEO-JULIET AND THE DARKNESS explores the period when Chezkoslovakia
had come under the influence of Nazi Germany during the Ilnd World War. Against
this backdrop of blood and gore, the novel focuses on an innocent teenage love
relationship. This peculiar juxtaposition of love and war helps raise much bigger

questions about humanity and the very basis of existencéfDespite no ghastly images
of obvious violence and its resultant aftermath being resorted to, the novel
successfully shatters the traditional romantic notions attached to the two phenomena.

In order to achieve a dramatic structure the chronological place of certain scenes had
to be shifted. Certain new scenes had to be written to suit this plirpose but they
obviously have emerged from the quintessential spirit of the novel.

The contemporary relevance of the play lies in the subject matter itself and
therefore
no extra-efforts had to be made on that account. For me it is the novel which
is of
prime importance followed by the ‘process’ undertaken to adapt it
to a theatre
performance; out of which subsequently the ‘design’ emerged. For me persona
lly, the
play has been a journey both as a writer and a directo
r.

The production of this play is highly indebted to Sh. Nirmal Verrna and I am
personally
thankful to the characters of Paul and Esther who inspired me to take
up this work.
