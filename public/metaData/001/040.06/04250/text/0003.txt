“he NSD, one of the foremost theatre training institutions in the
world and the only one of its kind in India, was set up in 1959.
Over the years the School has made advances on various fronts
including a rapid expansion of its activities in all parts of the country. It
has produced several actors, directors, script writers, designers,
technicians, educationists and scholars who work in theatre, films and
television. Many of the School's eminent alumni have been recipients of
numerous awards and felicitations at both the national and
international levels.
Training in the School is based on a thorough, comprehensive,
carefullyrplanned syllabus, which covers every aspect of theatre, in
which theory is related to practice, and in which all work is ultimately
put to test before the widest public. The syllabus takes into account
the methods of great theatre personalities who have shaped
contemporary theatre in all its variety of expressional forms. The
systematic study and practical performing experience of Sanskrit
drama, modern drama, traditional Indian theatre forms, Asian
drama and Western drama give the students a solid grounding and
wide perspective in the art oftheatre.
The School has a Repertory Company and Theatre—ianducation
Company in Delhi and a Regional Resource Centre at Bangalore.
NSD's Extension Programme seeks to extend and diffuse its
activities in all regions of the country. A programme for research,
documentation and publication is a recent addition to
strengthen the academic activities of the School. The School's
publications include anthologies of plays in different Indian
languages translated into English, reference works and theatre
studies in Hindi and two regular periodicals, viz. Rang Prasang
in Hindi, and Theatre India in English.
