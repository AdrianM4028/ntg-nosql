The Play
The play Du—kon depicts the contemporary social environment.These
days trends like modernization and globalization have led to human
emotions and qualities like love, brotherhood, friendship, kindness,

etc. being replaced by bitterness, violence and cruelty. Everyone
wants more and more. The young generation in particular is
affected the most as they find themselves in a complex
environment that is neither acceptable nor avoidable. Older
people long for earlier times while younger people clamour
towards modernization, thereby deepening the gap between the
generations.

Du-kon is a kind of a plant. The Garos believe that if anyone
stepped on this plant they would lose their way and drift
through the world without aim or direction. In the
contemporary world there are many reasons that could make
one lose one's way and the challenge is to know the difference
between what is good and what is bad.
