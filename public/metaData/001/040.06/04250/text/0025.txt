I he Play
Kharnba Khamnu, an orphan boy lives in Moirang ruled by the
meek King Puritlai, but actually controlled by his corrupt younger
brother, the Yubraj Chingkhuhae. One day Khamha comes to
Chingkhuba's house to get a job as hired help and Thoihi,
Chingkhuba's only daughter, falls in love with him. Gradually
Thoibi and Khamnu become friends. In the meanwhile General
Thonglen and Chaoba, the witty minister, plan to project
Khamba as the future ruler of Moirang by helping him win the
hand of Princess Thoibi. Chingkhuba and Nongban decide to
kill Khamba, but he is saved in time by Thoihi. The play then
looks at how the two are united despite the efforts of
Chingkhuba and Nongban, a rich nobleman.
