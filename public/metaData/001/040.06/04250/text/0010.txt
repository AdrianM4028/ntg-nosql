D 1 rector 5 note
The Bihu Festival is an integral part oiAssamese society. The three l’iihus, performed

£

at different times of the years, herald new seasons, new agricultural/tarming cycles,

with the Biliu songs and dances celehrating the vcgetation myth in a myriad ways
reflecting our longings, the need for life to germinate and the inextricalile link

hetween Nature and Man. livery Assamese child grows up with the spirit of liihu
deeply entrenched in his/her psyche. After my stint at the National School oi
l )rama l longed to do a play that would reflect the very essence ( it the Assamese way
oflif-e. I am grateful to Leela ( iogoi for the novel Noi lioilui, the inspiration liehind
the production; and to the playwright l’ankaj Jyoti liliuyan, lor lieing a constant
source of encouragement.
