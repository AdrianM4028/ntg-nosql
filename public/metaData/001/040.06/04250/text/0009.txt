Shubha, an accomplished Dhulia [traditional Assamese dhol’player
/drummer] is in love with Ghunusa, his teacher's daughter, who is

exceptionally gifted - 'lotus bloom in her steps, the cuckoo sings in
her gaze and she has only to wish and it rains.' The villagers,
battling a drought, arrange a ritualistic marriage of frogs to invoke
rain but it pours only when Ghunusa breaks into a dance.
Damodar, Shubha's brother, is also besotted with Ghunusa and

asks for her hand in marriage. Ghunusa's brother, Gambhir,
unhappy with the proposition, proposes that Ghunusa marry
the man whose buffalo emerges winner in the buffalo fight.
Shubha’s buffalo wins; Ghunusa confesses her love for Shubha;
Putuli, Damodar's neglected wife is invited into the fold, and

the community joyously celebrates the renewal of life.
