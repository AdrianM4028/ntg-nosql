Gournaga Mahaprabhu is a figure worshipped by the Hindu
community in Manipur as a reincarnation of Vishnu, and it is

around him that the entire Gouralila performance is focused.
Gourlila, a traditional performing art of Manipur is, in fact, based
on the events that took place in the life of Gournaga Mahaprabhu
starting from the time of his birth at Nabadwip (in Nadia District

ofWest Bengal) right until his death.
The historic play originated during the reign of King Chandrkriti
in the 18th century and began with depictions of just the Nimai
Sanyas. During the reign of King Churachand, however, it was
expanded till it ran for a full three days and included several
incidents contained in the Chaitanya Lilamrita, Amio Nimai, etc.
The Goumlila is performed by actors of different age groups
and can be categorized as an opera heavily influenced by Nat
Sankritunu and the elements of dance, musical dancing,

dialogues and colourful costumes.
