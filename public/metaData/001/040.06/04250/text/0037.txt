I he Play
Based against the background of Surpalakha's rejection by Rama
and Lakshman and the destruction of her brothers, Khor and

Dushan, at their hands, the play moves on to Ravanaâ€˜s entry into
the picture, Marich's disguise as a golden deer and the kidnapping
of Sita to Lanka. This is also the time when a quarrel breaks out
between Bali, the King of Kishkindha and his brother Sugreeva.
Bali drives Sugreeva and his two generals, Hanuman and

Jambuban, out of the kingdom and they are forced to take
refuge in the Rishyashringa mountains where they meet Rama
and Lakshman who are on the trail of the missing Sita. Rama
enters into an agreement with Sugreeva that if he defeats Bali,
Sugreeva and his army of monkeys would help him in his war
against Ravana, the King of Lanka. As the play progresses
Rama kills Bali and Sugreeva is declared King of Kishkindha.
