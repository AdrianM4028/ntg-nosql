Director's note
The advent of Hinduism in Manipur in the 18th century affected the tradition of r
performing arts in the state profoundly It broughtin the resurgence of sophisticated
cultural expressions in dances, songs and theatre. This tradition15 best exemplified
by the emergence of the Manipuri classical dance of Raas Lila, which is a product of
the synthesis between a Vaishnavite worldview and native beliefs and practices. The हैंड प'process of creating this synthesis is what had resulted in the popularization of
dance/music forms like the Gomulilu, the uniqueness of which lies in its elaborate
use of sets and props aided by traditional choreography.
In this play I have tried to interpret Gouranga's understanding of human
suffering, his trials, his subsequent search for peace in the Kalyug and his final
giving up of a worldly life in search of peace and righteousness.
