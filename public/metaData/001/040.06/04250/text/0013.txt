There are some people for whom money is the highest priority. The
play looks at such a person a man who neither knows the value of
money nor wants to spend it, but is motivated by the sole desire to
hoard it. To achieve this purpose he can go to any extent, from
hiding money in the ground, lending it at a high rate or interest,
suspecting everyone he comes across of heing a thief, inducing
quarrels among his domestic servants and then curtailing their
monthly salaries for doing so, stealing his daughter's cosmetics

or even negotiating her marriage with an old and wealthy man.
The final straw is reached when the man tries to marry the only
daughter of a very rich widow even though he knows that his
son is in love with her.
