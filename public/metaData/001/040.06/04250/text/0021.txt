The Caucasian Cluilk Circle is a play by the German modernist
playwright Bertolt Brecht. The governor of the capital faces
insurrection by the forces and is l<i 1 led . His wife manages to escape
but is forced to leave behind her child who is found by the maid
Grusha. She hides the child from the Prince and his soldiers,
thereby saving its life. The play tells the story of what happens
when the child is claimed by both its biological mother and
Urusha; of the ingenious way in which Judge Azdak takes his
decision and the stage manner in which justice is served. Set
within the context of political turbulence the play tells a story
of love in the time ofwar.
