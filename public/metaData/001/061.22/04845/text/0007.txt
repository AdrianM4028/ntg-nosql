While rehearsing, an argument erupts among the actors about the relevance of the play in the
present times. This argument leads to the famous debate between Tagore and Gandhi, and the
issue of man's freedom in to-day's scenario.

The discussions leads to many real issues faced to-day, like the Farraka 'barrage' and its effect
on the agriculture and fisheries of Bangladesh, Baglihar dam on river Chinab causing
problems in Pakistan, the effects of free economy and consumerist culture on the society and
'Gandhia-n social ism' versus 'Marxist social ism ' etc. After serious arguments and counter
arguments among the actors, the debate remains inconclusive and the play un-performed. In
the process, conceptual and practical problems of the contemporary theatre are also visited.
A, tribute to the great renaissance poet of India, the play is an attempt to provoke a dialogue
about man 's plight in to-day's world and to explore the possibility of the freedom of his body,
mind and soul, which Tagore and Gandhi so keenly desired.
