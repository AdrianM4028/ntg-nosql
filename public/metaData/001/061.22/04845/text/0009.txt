11118 Year, as we celebrate 150 years ofTagore, I felt that his ideologies
merited a revisit in the context of the tumultuous modern times. As a

tribute to his work and ideas, the play Ihmasha Na Hua depicts a group
of theatre actors rehearsing one of Tagore's most popular works —
Muktdhara. The narrative is essentially a discussion among the actors
on the relevance of the play which leads to a serious debate about the
freedom of men in the present political, technological and cultural
context. Needless to say, the debate remains inconclusive and the play
unperformed.
While dealing with the issues of freedom in the present times, the play
also gives voice to the problems, practical as well as conceptual, that
theatre faces in the present times.

Even as the audience is bound to leave with more questions than
answers, the play is above all, a tribute to the thought-provoking words
ofthe poet who continues to live on in our angsts, hopes and dreams.
