Freedom
V AHITYA Kala Parishad has been
presenting Vandemataram, the
story of India's freedom struggle
in the dance-drama form for the last
five years. First presented on the occasion of 40th anniversary of India’s
Independence, this year too the threedimensional dance-drama with special
sound and light effects was staged at
Talkathra Indoor Stadium as part of the
Republic Day celebrations.
Visualised by Surendra Mathur, Secretary, SK? and scripted and directed
by Mohan Upretti, this grand production provides a diversion to the social
tensions currently hottedup by the
communal forces.
The ballet traces the freedom struggle
from 1857, to 1947 and presents its high
lights through dance, music, and
audio-visual effects. The present recital
is not a chronological record but
attempts to create an emotional aura of
the events of that period.
The show takes off from the Apartheid in South Africa and movies on to

the mutiny led by Nana Sahib, Tantia
-'l‘ope and Rani Laxmi Bai who are
killed in action or are hanged. It also
enacts the escape of Nana Sahib and
the deportaton of B ahadur Shah Zafar
who is led to the Burmese Jail in
chains by the British soldiers as he
sings his favourite composition: Lagta
na/u' hai dil mera. The dance based on
slow movement and interpreting
'I'agore’s poem 0i bhubana mono
mohini was impressive and imaginative
though liberaties seemed to have been
taken with. the master piece creation of

the Nobel laureate. This is followed by
chanting of Ganesha Chaturthi when
Tilak gave the slogan: ‘Swaraj is my
birth right.’
