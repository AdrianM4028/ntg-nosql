Foundation is presenting a festival of plays from Jan. 11 to 16
about which one has written in
an earlier column and Sahitya
Kala Parishad (SKP) is reviving
— first presented in 1987 on the
40th anniversary of Independence — its highly acclaimed

dance drama Vande Mataram,
front Jan. 11 to 15 at the Talkatora Indoor Stadium. The production has been scripted and
directed by Mohan Upreti with
choreography by Sonar Chand.
Says Surendra Mathur, who

conceived the idea , “living in the
midst of chaos created by terror—
ism and social tensions which is

threatening to wreck our fabric
of freedom, one tends to forget
that we attained our freedom af-

ter a long, arduous struggle for
it.” “The dance-drama Vunde
Mataram has been conceived to
remind our people especially
younger ones the saga of freedom struggle so that they do
some introspection and stop the
wreckers of our freedom," he
adds.

Vande

The
Mataram is an encapsulated version of the glorious period of our
history brought alive through the V

spoken word. music, dance and
audio-visuals. But then it is not a
chronological account nor it is
meant to be one ', on the contrary

the attempt is to create the emotional and dramatic flavour of
those eventful years from 1857 to

the

SareJa/tan se A Che/1a, Raghupari
Raghav in the backdrop with superbly choreographed dance
movements in different geometrical patterns beautifully recreates the resolve of people involved in the struggle. The
movements choreographed by
Sonar Chand are simple but aesthetically delightful with simple
costumes generally reflecting the
colours of the national flag.
The seemingly disconnected
images of the events are really
merged into a whole. The slow
dance based on a Tagore lyric is
inspired by the brisk display of

lazium

and

chanting

during

Ganesh Utsav when Tilak gave
the slogan ‘Swaraj is my birthright'. This speaks highly of the
directorial skills. Yet another
scene that lingers in the mind is
the one depicting the divide and
rule policy of the British. The
Briton holds a flute and small
drum in his hands and the people

dance to his tune. He sets one
against another and they fight
amongst themselves. It is really a
wonder of choreography.
The song of jailed Bahadur

Shah Zafar Lagta Nahin Hai Dil
Mera adds poignancy to the
whole scene. The philosophy of
feelings

of - Gandhi,

Nehru.

Tilak. Tagore, Netaji Bose and
others have been intelligently
captured with spoken words
alongwith slides projected on the
screen. There is never a dull moment in this compactly designed
production.
Talkatora Stadium, which is

mainly for sports. has been very
imaginatively used with brilliant
sound and light design by R. K.
Dhingra. This really adds to the
spectacle of freedom movement.
Barun Gupta has created a music
which expresses a wide range of
emotion. The voice over by Ram
Gopal Bajaj. Hema Sahai and
K. K. Nair create vivid dramatic
effects.

S [ E are on the cressroads of
history where we have to stop
the tide of chaos. This needs a
deep plunge into the past, into
the saga of sacrifice of our people in the process of freeing from
the bondage of foreign rule. And
for this the multi-media production presented by SKP is a must
for us.
