MAHABHARAT

चंडीगढ

महाभारत
(धर्मवीर भारती के सुप्रसिद्ध उपन्यास "अंथायुग" पर आधारित)
(Based on Dharrnavir Bharati’s well known play “ANDHAYUG”)

MAHABHARATA : the great epic created by sage WASA
is perhaps the most important human document surviving
from antiquity. lt celebrates Man’s strength while dwelling on
his perennial weaknesses and frailities. Every possible human dilemma has been included and translated in the epic in
terms of situations which test man 's ability to ﬁght the immoral
and negative which is both within and without him. No wonder
that it continues to hold our imagination after thousands of
years of its creation.
In India this epic has inspired , and continuously informed
the very texture of life. But, at does not belong to a community
or a religion or even a country. It has the capacity and power
to sustain the entire human race in these most testing times.

Andha Yug (literally translated as the blind epoch) conceived by Dr. Dharamvi r Bharaﬁ addresses to contemporary
longings and anxieties, while depicting the last stage of the
great battle fought betwen PANDAVAS and KAURAVAS.

Its unique theatricality and powerful verse and its profound understanding of the current anguish as well as of
WASA'S Mahabharata rang true in a stife torn world. The
belief of the audiences was caught immediately.
Almost all important directors in India tried this play in
different forms, styles and variety of spaces. It was done in
regular theatres, in basements, in terraces, even in ancient
forts and always generated lively controversies and debates
among the theatre people and the press.
