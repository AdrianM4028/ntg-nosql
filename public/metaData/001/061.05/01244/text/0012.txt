KA RN A BH ARAM
कर्ण भारमू
(मज्ञाकवि मास के संस्तुत नाटक पर आधारित)
(Based on the great Sanskrit playwright Bhasa’s Sanskrit drama)

The play, based on Mahakavi Bhasa’s Sanskrit drama,
is a direct approach towards the identity crisis of an individual
in the modern world. Modern civilisation's dehurnanising
inﬂuences in human society are crystallised through the
agonies and travails faced by Kama, who was a victim of
class and caste discriminations- the evils that beset the
modern society, putting heavy impediments on the growth of
an individual.

Then again through ﬂash back the episode of how
Parashurarn cursed him, that the weapons and their technique that he had learnt from the sage would fail him in his
hour of need, is depicted. Kama, a Kshstriya by birth, learnt
under the feet of Parashurarn under the concealed identity as
a Brahrnin disciple.

Another gripping episode shows how Kama gives away
his invincible “Kawach and Kundala" to Indra, who begs him
in the guise of a Brahrnin.

Kama while moving into the battle-ﬁeld is saddened by
the thought that he would be battling his own brothers against
the promise that he had made to his mother. He confesses
his real identity to Shalya, his charioteer, through ﬂash back,

Thus bereft of his Kawacha and Kundala and the curse
of Parashurarn he orders Shalya to drive him to where Arjuna

the episode of his birth, when the sun-god meets his unwed

is.

mother Kunti, who for fear of society forsakes him, is shown.
