The spiritual aftermath of the Kalinga War by Emperor Ashoka,
his agony and struggle and
his final victory are rec'aptured in this play. it tries to
expostulate an ideal human
situation in the modern context. The existence of both
good and evil in the conscience .of modern man
seems to be dominated by
*
evil aspects. As a result human being has lost control over his mind. We need to gain lasting mental strength and contentment — the source of real peace
and equanirnity of mind. Priyadarshi (Ashoka) in this play sets
an example both as a confused man and a man who gains the
path of human kind and peace by eliminating the evil desire
which was growing inside himself.
