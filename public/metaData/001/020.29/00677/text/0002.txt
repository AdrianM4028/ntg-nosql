A NOTE ON THE PRODUCTION

In a progressive society the children ought to be a privileged
class. But unfortunately this statement does not hold good
vis-a-vis the Indian theatre in the post—Independence era. lndian
theatre, and more particulariy the Hindi theatre which, apartfrorn
facing innumerable socio-economic problems has also been so
engrossed in an identity crisis of discovering its 'rnodern' format,
that it seems to have completely ignored our chiéd audiences
depriving them of their due share of entertainment and education
through one of the most living of media—a media which has
max.mum potential to enhance the imagination and fantasies of a
child in a more creative as well as constructive manner than any
other art form. Theatre is a force which helps both the parti- cipants and the audiences "see" what we "think" and even
beyond.
But the children of our country are so heavily loaded with
bagfuls of books that they rarely get an opportunity to share an
experience of true living theatre because there is hardly any such
theatre for them l This is also because the theatre/culture in
almost all the major cities in this country has centralised itself
into a particular zone (for example, in Delhi Mandi House)
thereby denying itself of the possibility of reaching out to the
audiences !

KHILONA, Creative Centre for Children wishes to take up
the task of taking healthy, creative, meaningful theatre to the
children by giving regular performances I N the schools.
