Di rector’s note

“NEDOROSL” by Russian Playwright D.l. Fonvizin, written in
the 18th Century is one of the much staged and popular play
i n the

USSR.

“PAPPU” the Hindustani adaptation of this play is the first
effort of its kind on Delhi stage of any 18th century classic
Russian writer.

Portraying the pure nationalist characters of Fonvizin has
been the foremost problem I haVe been faced with.

Fear psychosis of the first attempt does have it's reflection

on the play of

not being well knitted according to my

perception, for which I make an earnest confession.

In my

opinion “PAPPU” has a valid relevance to Indian context
and shows the contemporary Socio-Economic situation of

rural Indian life.

l have tried

to portray the rural elite

falling prey to their lust of wealth and vulgar imitation of
urban culture and styles.
Though on a low pitch yet

the problem of bonded labour has not been left untouched.
I feel it imperative on my part to pay my thanks to the team
who took great pains to put up the play.

At last the play is before you to be judged.

Plus as well as

minus will be an invaluable gift for me in this endeavou
r.
With sincere regards.
