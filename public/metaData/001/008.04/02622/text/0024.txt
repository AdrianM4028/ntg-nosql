Planning 18 a contmuous
movement; towards desired

gals...”
—Jawahar LalNehru

Years ago, Pandit Nehru inspired us at ONGC to systematically plan for the
future.
As a result, each successive year has seen ONGC reach new heights of perform
ance
and growth.
In 1986-87, the production of crude oil increased to 27.86 million tonnes;
and that of
gas to 1729 million cubic metres...

नै As many as 10 oil/gas strikes were made...
I -' : The Company's contribution to the national exchequer rose to Rs. 3139 crores
'
And planning has become a culture and a way ofwork at ONGC.
Because, for a rapidly developing country like ours, one of the most important goals is
self-sufﬁciency in oil resources.
