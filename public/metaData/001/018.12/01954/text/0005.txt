It’s one of the happiest occasions, rare one indeed. when
of staging

A FESTIVAL OF PERFORMING ARTS on a national

theatre, has found a new encouragement and a great new hOpe.

LUDHIANA, has had an Oportunity
scale.

Our involvement

with the

This festival, I am sure would help

in motivating new young talent and would create a magnetic draw towards the theatre.
However, I may add, that to make theatre self sustaining and an engaging media of entertainment, new horizons would have to be

explored for laying a Stronger foundation of contemporary Indian

theatre, improvement of stage techniques, and securing a consensus amidst many scattered theatrical
ideologies.

It calls for a cornmittrnent for evolving new forms of drama, so that the theatre movement

stands nourished with inspiration, encouragement and dedication. Initially it is here, where the involvement
of the industry becomes a necessity, so that the lack of support from the Cinema addicted audience is

compensated by the encouragement from the industry, which shall be instrumental in creating, moulding
and fostering audience interest and taste for the stage.

The experimentation necessary to gear up this

taste can only come through patronisatIOn of the theatre, to make it more prolific.
Theatre today needs the punch, the anecdotal quality to make it a lively media.

Our ethos

must penetrate the theatre movement to enable it to make a substantial contribution to our social
scenario.

I wish this festival a grand success and do thank our guests, the players and the participants.
