THE DUMB WAITER
By Harold Pinter

Ben .................... Aftab Seth
Gus .................... Ashok Chopra
This is a play about two men, two colleagues out on a “job”
together; Through them the author tries to show how difﬁcult it
is fOr one human being to get across to another ——even though
both know each other well. This emphasis on communication or

the lack of it is basic to Pinter—language, the situation, and even
the pauses as used by Pinter acquire new meaning and take on
the appearance of a carefully choreographed ballet.
Ben and
Gus—the two

characters in this play are ever so slightly idiotic

in many ways very real and often almost pathetic. But they
are
typical Pinter characters, and this is a typical Pinter play.
