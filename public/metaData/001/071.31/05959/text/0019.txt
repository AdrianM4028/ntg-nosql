We Won The Shﬁeﬂd
A FEW WORDS FROM ST.

XAVIER’S

Last year, we the students of St. Xavier’s participated in the All Patna One
Act Play Festival, for the second time. Providence and hard work conspired to give

us the shield, and there is no denying that We were happy about it.

But that

is only part of the reason; what we were also happy about is that in the
Festival we found C so many people who were as interested as we, in the most
pleasant and absorbing art of acting. It is not that we are in any manner
whatsoever ‘lovers’ in this particular ﬁeld, but the thing is that the many groups of
people who are genuinely enthusiastic about this classic art, hardly ever get
to know of each other’s existence.

by the All Patna One Act Play Festival is very timely and extremely creditable.
We wish it, all success in the years to come.
