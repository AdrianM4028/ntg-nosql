Synopsis :
Outside the gates of Eternity, the Soul of the graduate meets
the Clay and the Spirit. The frightened girl longs to return to
Earth, where the doctors are working to save her body injured in

an automobile accident on the eve of Commencement. The Clay
reminds her of the joys of earth. The Spirit bids her to accept
God’s will, as announced by Sariel, God’s Angel of Death, whether
it decrees return to earth or not. As the girl waits in doubt,
others appear : the frightened suicide, the old old woman who longs
for Sariel’s Summons, the young mother who is worried about her
children, the blind child led by his guardian angel. Inspired by
them the graduate ﬁnds faith and courage to obey the bidding of

Sariel. The play ends on a note of serene happiness as the resigned
Graduate receives Sariel’s message to—return to Earth!
