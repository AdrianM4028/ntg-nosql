WHEN IT PRESENTS

The Rising of the Moon
(A comedy in one act written by Lady Gregory)

It is a moonlit night and a dangerous convict has jumped a
nearby Jail.

The scene opens to a side of a quay in a seaport town, a strategic
point which the convict might try to cross. A sergeant is on guard.
He is only too anxious to catch the. convict, for there’s a prize on his
head. But the Sergeant also feels lonely there with nothing but the
moon. None shall be allowed to cross the steps down to the sea tonight.
A Ballad Singer is the ﬁrst one to be stopped by the Sergeant.
What follows you MUST see at the rising of the curtain.
