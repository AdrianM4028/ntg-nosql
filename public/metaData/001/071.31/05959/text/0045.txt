SYN0PSlS
The dearth of houses in Delhi compells Shri Banarsi Das to tell a lie that he
is married to the female owner of a vacant house and he secures the house on rent.

When Banarsi Das has to face up to his problem when the owner tries to evict
him Shakuntalla saves the situation for Banarsi Das when she tells the lie that she is

Banarsi Das’ wife.
One new lie can’t undo the ﬁrst lie but brings on further implications and so
poor Banarsi Das beComes most involved in a love mess. Let us see if he comes out
of it with glory or not.
