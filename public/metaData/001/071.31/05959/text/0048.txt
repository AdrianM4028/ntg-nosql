the British Navy which had appointed a publisher who had never
been to sea as its Lord of the Admiralty. In the play the proud
Captain of the Pinafore wants his daughter, Josephine, to marry Sir
Joseph Porter, the ﬁrst Lord of the Admiralty. But Josephine loves
a humble sailor on board her father’s own ship.
Caught in the act of trying to elope with Josephine, Ralph
Rackstraw, ls sentenced to a dungeon for his bold and unheard of act.
However “Buttercup” produces the ev1dence that the Captain is the
poor man and that Ralph really should have the position of Captain.
All ends happily.
