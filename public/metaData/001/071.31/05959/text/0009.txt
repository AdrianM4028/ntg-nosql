“On the occasion of the Third All Patna One Act Play
Festival being held in November, I send hearty greetings and
best wishes to the Patna One Act Play Festival. Cultural Society,
its constituents, participants and workers. Drama is an effective
medium to foster the desirable and eradicate the undesirable in
man’s social behaviour. The relaxed mind assimilates easily
suggestions of an ideal through entertainment. I hope the Festival will provide, in addition to the usual attractions, occasions
for the elevation of man and his spirit to the higher plane of
consciousness and point the way to a richer and fuller life for
all.
I wish success to the Society and the Festival.
