The history of community drama is the history of the drama in general.

Its. orlgiins

are bound up with the ritual rite of the tribal community, and fins was, perhaps, the} r51:

and purest type of community drama conceivable.

Throughout the great per10d of

reed

classical drama, too, the method and atmosphere of stage production was more closely allle

to that of community drama as we know it today than it was to the modern profess1onal
theatre. In Medieval times as well, there was no special class of professlonal stage workers
or managers, but play production was undertaken by a whole community.

Although

a new

professional theatre

movement started in Europe

durlng the

period of the Renaissance, there was also a new impetus of commumty drama presented
by universities and schools. After the foundation in 1855, of the Cambridge .Universny
Amateur Dramatic Club, and some years later by that of Oxford University, interest 1n amateur
drama became widespread. This culminated in the modern Little Theatre movement. Slmﬂar
currents were also sweeping the theatrical circles of Russia, France, Ireland and Germany,

and, after the turn of the century, the movement spread to the United States and Canada.
By the end of the ﬁrst World War, the new spirit in the theatre was so well established that
drama at once occupied an important place in all schemes for social and cultural
reconstruction.

How can a community theatre be established?

A few drama enthusiasts determine

to establish a little theatre, somewhere in the centre of town or in the suburbs.

A meeting

is called, a committee formed, and important people from the area invited to extend their
symphathy and approval, or subscribe the new undertaking. The newly-formed group
rent
a hall, choose a programme of ﬁve or six plays to be spread out over a determined
seasons,
and amateurs are invited to give expression to their acting ability. Although the
spirit is,
and probably will always remain largely amateur, if the threatre group is succes
sful, often
the membership organization employs the services of a professional director, with
the additional
professional service of designer, stage carpenter, electrician and so forth,
as necessity requires.
Gradually the movement identiﬁes itself with one of the three main types
of Little Theatres:
the art theatre, the community theatre, or the college theatre.
The art theatre is the direct result of the desire of many

themselves creativety in play-writing, acting, directing, desi
gning, or stage management. The
community theatre is organized to provide good entertainm
ent for the average family in the
community, and to be successful it must give the larg
est possible number of people the
opportunity to have some part in the work as, playwright
, director, designer, actor, scenepainter, seamstress, electrician, business manager, play-r
eader, prompter, ticket taker, house
manager, usher
etc. Thus the community theatre in itself b

courses of drama in the drama department and the thea

increasingly today, work done in these courses is count
