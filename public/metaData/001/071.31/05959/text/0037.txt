Synopsis
The story takes place in an interior village. Brihaspat and
Meriam, an uneducated village couple, have their son in college. The
son, Somar, is the only graduate in an area of one hundred square

miles. He has also qualiﬁed for Bihar Public Service. The parents’
only wish is to see their son a magistrate.
l ut this is Gandhij ’s
centenary year. Somar has a new call—to stay in the village and lift
the villagers to a new life. The play is a war of ideas between father
and son. Who wins? This is the theme of the play.
