“THE RUSTIC” is almost entirely a psychological character
study: All the characters are dynamic ﬂexible, pulsating, and so
human. '

The loyal and obedient servant Luka is consoling Mrs. Bopov
who is discovered in, deep mourning seven months after her husband’s death.

She is a complete contrast I to the lagressive, boorish
and boistrous character of SMIRNOV, who is determined
to get
the money, which Mrs. Popov’s husband owed
him, immediately.
She hasn’t the money. The argument, in which bo
th of them tear
each other, is helped up into a climax.
The play is typically Chekhov.
