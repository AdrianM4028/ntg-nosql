Obviously having little knowledge in the art of apt conversation
Mrs. Larkin had inadvertantly given out during one of her garden
parties that she would relish the idea of being a pioneer in the ﬁeld
of salesmanship for women. Mrs. Larkin has speciﬁed that she would
even go to the extent of setting aside every Thursday for staying at
home and interviewing saleswomen.
fl he very next day the news is out in the papers before the innocent has had time to realize the gravity of the situation. Jane Post,
her sister, has seen the notiﬁcation in the papers too and hurries to

comfort the headstrong Mrs. Larkin at her residence. To her dismay
Jane learns that her sister’s staunch maid, Sarah, is having her day

off. Her protective instinct is stimulated and she volunteers to stay
and save her sister from the vicious claws of the saleswomen. But
Mrs. Larkin will have none of it. Jane leaves and Mrs. Larkin’s
apartment inevitably sees the continuous arrival of determined agents:
There is Prudence Pearce, the forceful psychologist, Mrs. Meltz,
the rustic ﬂower-seller, the clumsy Hilda with her useless sweeper,
the gushing Henrietta from the Cutie Curlers, the persuasive Rhea

Bates of the Clean Sweep Vacuum, and ﬁnally the fashionable
photographer of the Ketchum Laﬂin Studio. All are determined to
sell their respective wares and Mrs. Larkin ﬁnds herself in a hopeless
turmoil.
As the situation reaches its climax, back comes the loyal Sarah
like a gift from heaven. With her customary competence she tackles
the situation, leaving a much wiser and chastened Mrs. Larkin to

cancel any further “Thursdays at Home,”
