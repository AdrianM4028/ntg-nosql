Small-Town Stalwarts
Dyaneshwar Nadkarni describes the excellent productions being staged
by Kala Sangam, Patna.
A week long drama f'es-

patriots like Phanishwar Nath

tival opened under the auspices of Kala
Sangam at

Renu' took keen interest in it

during the weekend deﬁnitely

should adequately prove Kala

Bhartiya Nritya Kala Mandir.

Sangam’s

Kala Sangam is staging most
of the plays-they are by
Rakesh, Badal Sirkar, Madhu
Rye,

Vijay

Tendulkar and

Shanti Mehrotra.

Two more

productions have come here

from New Delhi's N. S. D.
Satish Anand, the young
directer of Kala Sangam is
live-wire

force

behind

the

credentials.

But

what is more significant is

ated with it.

that over the. past decade or
so all the major plays of
Rakesh. Badal Sirkar. Girish

Karnad and Vijay Tendulkar
as well as Significant Hindi
plays have been staged by
Kala Sangam in Patna. Encouragement for such efforts
does not neccessarily compare

dramatic activities

of

this

with the public response one
gets for avant grade theatre

organisation. That

Jayapra-

in major cities like Bombay.

Delhi and Calcutta. But the
two Kala Sangam’s produc-

ron and the dedicated writer—

ﬁfth production of Rakesh’s ५
play that I was witnessing. f

The others starred Amrish है

(in

Marathi) Om Shivepuri and l
Manohar Singh. Kala Sangam’s was a well rehearsed .,

show. Satish Anand in the ३
