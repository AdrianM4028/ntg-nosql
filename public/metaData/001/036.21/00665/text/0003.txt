Meera lost her twenty paise coin

7 ,. Who cares!

PNB does 2
Meera is sad. Today. she had saved
20 paise from her pocket allowance.
Clutching the coin, 'she. was gamboling
back home from school, when suddenly
it slipped out of her hand and was lost.
Her day's saving is gone l
Meera is sad not because her loss is
much but because her saving box will go
hungry today. She feeds it daily. She
puts’in it not only what she can save
from her pocket allowance but also any
extra money she receives on festive and
other occasions.
Paradoxically, Meera's box is never full l

On the ﬁrst of every’ month she takes out

ten rupees and, accompanied by her
mother, goes to PNB to deposit the sum

in her Recurring Deposit Account. She
knows that her savings grow there with
interest. By depositing Rs. 10/-every month,

she will get Rs. 395/— after three years!
Meera's mother too has a Saving Fund
Accoont with PNB. And daddy ? Oh, yes
he too !
Indeed, PNB has deposit schemes to suit
everybody. Here are some of them :

Recurring Deposit * Special Fixed
Deposit है Old Age Provision Deposit
