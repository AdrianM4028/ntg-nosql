Note

My one act play Brahmchari Yaksha was somewhat popular (in
Maharashtra) way back in the ﬁfties. The full length play of the same title
is a recent product with some elements of the old one.
When I said I had no further material. for the “author’s note”, a

well meaning friend advised me to write a few lines about the title. The
Yaksha in the title is rather puzzling, he said. Would keep people guessing
and spoil the effect of this wonderful play, he pleaded. As I do not wish to
take the latter risk, I hereby oblige.
Please recall Kalidasa’s “Meghdoot” and its pining hero—~a Yaksha—

separated from his wife.

The Yakshas like Gandharvas and Kinnars are
by Kuber from

supposed to be supernatural beings.

They are ruled

Alkapuri, the capital of Yakshalok.

That’s about all I know about the

Yakshas.

The audience also need not know more.

A tip : don’t lie in

wait for the Yaksha—just relax and you will know all, by and by.
The play does not have any philosophic interpretations ; it does
not probe the human mind in any given circumstances ; it does not attack
is
the institution of marriage or propagate widow remarriage ; in short, it

written for unadulterated entertainment.

No harm in that, I hope.

While the Marathi original is waiting in a queue in Bombay, the Hindi

translation is seeing the spot lights ﬁrst. My sincere-7 thanks to
