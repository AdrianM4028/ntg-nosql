A few years back a spurned NOBEL PRlZE called the world attention to a lonely
philosophy of despair. "Man can count on no one but himself ; he is alone, abandone
d
on earth in midst of his inﬁnite responsibilities without help, with no other aim than
the
one he sets himself, with no other destiny than the one he forges for himself
on this
earth”. This is the philosophy of EXiSTENTlALISM as set down by Jean
Paul Sartre,
a 63-year old Frenchman who recently astonished the world by turning down
the Nobel
Prize for Literature. Existentialism is a philosophy based on despair-sombre,
demanding

and Godless.

Over the past two decades it has brought about radical changes in

Westorn thought and Western society and its mood is expressed
by scores of today's
writers.
,

Born in Paris in 1905, Jean Paul Sartre studies philosophy
and took up teaching.

After service in the Resistance he became a writer.

His philosophical books—notably

L'Etre et le ne'ant (1943)-have caused him to be regarded as
the founder of Existentialism.

Sartre, who is resigned to being walleyed and
short has for years acted on his
thoughts—as beﬁts any Existentialist~with
bravado. He quit teaching phiiosophy to
join the Resistance movement in World War II,
and was once a German captive. So
the War has left a great impact on his work.

His plays deal more with human freedom.
Men without Shadows is a brutal
study of the effects of torture on captured memb
ers of the Maquis. Here he is trying to
conv

ey that all men live enveloped in whole times
. Al I are born with halters round
their necks, but it is only when caught in
the swift. sudden turn of death, that mort
als
realize the silent, subtle, ever present peril
s of life. There are ﬁve alienated priso
ners,
poignantly abondaned, without help. Now,
facing imminent death, they are exposed
to

intense awareness of their contigency
.

They have become transparent to

themselves as
well as to others and thus are unable to
face their realself. We have lost our touc
h so much
that occasionally we can not help feeli
ng a sort of disgust with “real life".
Ther
e are
two team and important thing for them
is to win, in the process trying desperatel
y
to
make
themselves what they are in the eyes of other
s.
