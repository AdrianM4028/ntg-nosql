every dawning sun brings a flood at
interads-a flood of ideas-advertising ideas

which aren’t 'fish-hook-catches’ of an
unrestricted sail of imagination-but
created with pains-a lot of brainteasing-by a creative cell-who
knows its job.
Ideas-of course are clothed with
imagination-with pictures-and
words and unleashed
-to drive the message home
-in the market of each individual client
-with conviction.
