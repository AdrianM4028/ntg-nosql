Note of a. Director
D even d ra R aj

These are my first six productions after graduating from National
School of Drama

in 1972 The idea behind DUtting up six plays together is an experiment in itself. I have just
taken six people and each of them is in different roles so that
the audience may get a total
perspective of these actors as far as their growth from one role
to another is concerned.

All the actors are new to the professional theatre in the sense that they have graduated from the school this year only. Working with them has been a fruitful experien
ce
for me and if I have failed somewhere, it is totally my own responsibility.

A few words about the production of these plays ..... these are a prologue to my
next project i e. visual presentation of Hindi stories on the stage.
As a director, I am
doing away with all kinds of external aids such as the setting, make-up recorded music etc.
in a production. I have put more and more emphasis on the script and tried to discover
how it can be interpreted through the actors only. Even if there is some setting in some
of the plays, it is just functional and all the other sound and music effects are live.

In all, these productions may give an idea of my work where I am trying, how far
an actor himself can be instrumental in presenting the maximum of visuals on the stage.
