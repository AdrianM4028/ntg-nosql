eight regions were brought together. What was
remarkable was that, though each person had
come from a completely different background;

Asianness, as it was, what could be termed, “the
pursuit of disparity’. Setting forth from 1,995, this

between Japan and Thailand: Alfaonz' -1€ea’Demo7z

as well as others.
In this way, with the connection with

Southeast Asian theatre gradually building up, the
Japan Foundation began to set its sights on South
Asia, which was lagging in the area of cultural
exchange. The year 2002 saw the launching of
a new project involving: India, Sri Lanka, Nepal,
Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This time rather than
have one director as the focus of the collaboration
as we had done previously, we decided to attempt

collaboration, we came up with a plan to invite one
director from each country to come and take part.

countries ofAsia; in contrast the South Asia project
would involve theatre directors, who, though

they had limited opportunity to work together
for reasons of politics and economics, shared
a common historical and cultural background.

This would be a chance for these artists, working
together, to take a new look at the problems that
beset their respective countries from a universal

perspective. Having a team of directors could also
be viewed as a method for clarifying objectives in
thinking jointly about problems. The subject that
these five directors came up with was the person
who had built the Mogul empire, the greatest
Islamic kingdom in South Asia’s history, Babur.

Babur was born in what is now Uzbekistan and
for twenty-five years he went on an expedition
of conquest that ultimately led him to India,

the five directors chose to explore some of the
inconsistencies that beset modern South Asia.
This extremely difficult effort, came
to fruition in a multi-media creation entitled:
Memories (f a Legend - Samar/ﬁnd, Kabul,
Hindustan. In 2004, it was performed in ' ‘okyo
and Kyoto and the following year 2005 it adorned

the opening of the largest International festival
in Southern Asia, "I‘he National Theatre Festival’

(held in Delhi). The work could finally be seen
and questioned about its implications.
The present project, [Jew/firming [Vomen
can be seen in this way as part of a current that has

been moving since the 1990’s. Working with the
countries of East Asia, Southeast Asia and South
Asxa we have, one step at a time, come to produce
works and have attempted to expand our area of
operation still further and further. In this program
we have chosen Central Asia: Uzbekistan; Iran;
a part. of the Persian cultural sphere and finally,
to maintain a sense of continuity from previOu
s

pi‘Ojects we. have once again included India.
