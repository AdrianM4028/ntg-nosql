Panic prevails in the oﬁ‘rcialdom of Mayor‘Rai Saheb and his district subordinates on a friendly hint announcing the arrival of the “INSPECTOR GENERAL",
incognito, at Maujpur. The hunt begins to ‘catch’ the . Inspector General before the
oﬁicrals are themselves caught napping by him.
.
As f‘emale sense would have it, Manorarna and Kiran vie with each other to
Impress the Inspector General’ and prepare for his reception.
'
Theflnspector General’ is ‘caught’ by the trembling and awestricken MayOr and
brought to his household after showing around Govt. institutions.
'

The culprits of bureaucracy manage well to bribe the ‘l.G.’ who eventually wins
over both mother and the daughter and at last is ‘betrothed’ to the latter.. The ‘l. G..’
departs ‘for a few days’ his head full of alcohol and happy memories, and his pockets

bulging with money.

'

Concious of his triumph, the Mayor grows more insolent, more bullying and
grabbing than ever before, and day-dreams of his own greatness to come.
The
InSpectorGeneral’s ‘return' is announced by a gendarme, to the consternation and

dismay of one and all.
What one pays for being corrupt and for indulging in social misdeeds is a
worthy lesson to remember.
