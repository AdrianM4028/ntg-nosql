OUR CHILDREN
SHOULD INHERIT

A BETTER WORLD
Family Planning in our country is an essential part of our whole
strategy of enlarging welfare.

Greater Welfare is, in fact,

the only reason for Family Planning. And we need it not
because we are against more children but because
we want every child to have the best opportunity

possible in life.

We want our children to

inherit a better world than our own.
This is the aim of every father and
mother,

and

this is the

objective of ३ planned
development.
