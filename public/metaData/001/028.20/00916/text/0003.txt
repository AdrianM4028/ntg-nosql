Keeping in the view the 20 point programme of our
Hon’ble Prime Minister and 4 point programme of youth
leader Shri Sanjay Gandhi the club has pleasure
to present our play "KHULEE BAAT” which
exclusively deals with the Population

Explosion, a stark reality which the nation
is facing today.

It is our humble pre-

sentation on the tell-tale problem of
Family Planning in a humorous yet
meaningful way. We hope our
little effort in this direction
will

contribute sub-

stantially
largest

to the
ever

effort
undertaken in the annals

of mankind in conveying this messaege to the masses.
