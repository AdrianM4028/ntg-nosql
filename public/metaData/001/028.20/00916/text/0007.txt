from the reformative mood of HAMARA GAON to the classical mood of AUR
BHAGWAN DEKHTA RAHA, from farcical mood of ULJHAN and BADE ADMl to the
children playful moods in the THREE PLAYS FOR

CHILDREN and from these all the

implications of socio-political interactions portrayed in ROTl AUR BETI and WAH RE
lNSAAN is indeed a glorious journey of which any amateur or professional theatre
group in any part of the world may well be proud of.

Today the THREE ARTS CLUB is able to analyse and view its devel0pment and
plan for its further growth mainly due to the fact that all through the thirty three years
there has been a continuity of collective leadership.

Thus many enthusiasts have been

in its told at one time or the other but their desire for discovering new pastures has
not broken the chain.

This is yet another lesson which has to be learnt by all who

wish to make a contribution to the development of an art movement.

Finally another signiﬁcant feature of the life and work of THREE ARTS CLUB
has been that what it sought to accomplish was always with the objective of furthering
the dramatic art for the sake of art rather than for any reward or recognition.

In this

process its economy might have suffered but never its standards; its devel0pment may
not have been meteoric but certainly slow and sure.

And today as one looks back with
a historian‘s objectivity; one ﬁnds that the THREE ARTS CLUB has won cudos from

the personalities of such emminence as the Late Prlrne Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, the
Late Presidents Dr. Rajendra Prasad and Dr. Zakir Husain and the present elite in the
poltical social and art spheres not because these were desired but because these cudos
came as rewards for devotion to the cause of art, of drama, of creation and of taste in
the common man. To these objectives the THREE ARTS CLUB remains committed

and these indeed are its guiding stars.
