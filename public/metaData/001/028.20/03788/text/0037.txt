P

It is heartening to note that the Three Arts Club is being
revived. The Three Arts Club contributed vastly to the
theatre movement in Delhi. Raja Kaul’s contribution as the
founder member and General Secretary was the cornerstone

of the club’s success and it is certainly remarkable and
undoubtedly applaudable.

I was pleasantly surprised when I got to know that his
daughter Smt. Anuradha Dar has decided to revive the club
on the occasion of his 25th death anniversary. This again is
creditable and I wish her all the best in her endeavour.

I

would also like to convey my best wishes to all the people
who are supporting her in this noble effort to give theatre and
direction, just like three arts club did over half a century ago.
With regards,
Yours sincerely,
