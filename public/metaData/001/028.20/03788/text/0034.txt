The origin of theatre is lost in lime. Yet we know that mimic is
something very close to Man and perhaps after the cave
man's drawings, mimicking human behavior repeatedly
may have finally created theatre.

Again, theatre in India has a hoary past going deﬁnitely up
to the 6’h century A. D. Therefore it is indigenous to us. While
religious theatre remained strong in temples, the use of the
‘art' for social comment is sporadic even today.
The advent of cinema in India nearly dealt a death knell to
theatre, but since theatre had strong old roots, it survived. In
North India however the tradition of theatre has remained
more rural and urban theatre has been far and few.

Therefore the latest effort to revive the Three Arts Group is
something to applaud. Its revival will add to the small
number of dedicated groups to be found today in towns and

.cities; and incidentally it will revive memories of this Group
who enjoyed a name for themselves not many years ago.
We wish all success to all who are now associated with this
work.
