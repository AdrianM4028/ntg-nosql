I'm glad to know that the Three Arts Club is being revived. I've been associated with theatre in the past
and fondly remember the good old days, when theatre was at its peak. Gradually it is dying a slow death.
I hope that the revival ofthe Three Arts Club can arrest this trend.

The role of amateurs in the theatre movement has often been understated, in the rare event it is

recognized. Roles of theatre groups such as the Three Arts, which promote amateurs, are crucial if
theatre needs to be sustained. I would like to convey my best wishes to everyone associated with in this
noble endeavour.
I wish Three Arts Club a successful future.
