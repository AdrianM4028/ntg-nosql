If you look at any of the decent actors we have today,almost all have their roots in theatre. It is infact
theatre that 1s the most 1081.: and simple way that an actor can communicate with an audience!

I am delighted that my English teacher from school Ms. Kaul d/o Mr. R.M. Kaul is reviving her father's
legacy, that may Infact be our collective legacy of theatre in this country. As I read about the Three Art
Club, my m1nd ï¬‚ew to Simpler times when there must have been no multiplexes and cell phones and
television to distract from the purest form of acting, theatre. How men and women must have dressed up
in their sunday best and gone to the theatre!

I am so delighted that Anu ma'am is reviving this club and its activities on the 25th Anniversary of her
father's passing. Theatre needs people like her to keep it alive and kicking.
My very best wishes ma'am !
