RASHMI VAJPEYI
DIRECTOR

We, in Natarang Pratishthan, are very happy to learn that Three Arts Club is being
a part
revived. We hope it would make signiﬁcant contribution to Delhi theatre and become
ofthe rich and complex vitality it has.
'I‘AC in the past has attempted a theatre which was socially conscious and looked

critically at the social concerns of the day. In a way it was a continuation of the glorious
Parsi theatre-tradition and created a dedicated audience of theatre; Its regularity and plays

done for children by the adults were other factors which added to its relevance.
Shri Ramesh Mehta was popular actor, playwright and director and earned wide
recognition in 19503 and 19603 as someone who could regale audiences in a variety of
roles. Plays like "Under Secretary", "Roti aur Beti", "Bade Admi", Aur Bhagwan Dekhata
Raha" etc. were great hits of that era. They ere played to houseful auditoria and people
thronged to the Sapru House to see these productions, some of them again and again.

Rarnesh Mehta created a theatre which become popular in the audience and addressed their
problems and anxieties in his theatre.

On this occasion I extend all the good wishes for the success ofthis endeavour.
