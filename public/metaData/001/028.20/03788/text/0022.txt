A Window in the Memory Lane

Dear Anuradha Dar's letter informing me that the Three Art's Club has decided to stage a Drama
Festival in May,2008, was a very pleasant surprise. Immediately, a window in my memory lane started
gradually opening and took me back by six decades - India after independence.
I could clearly see the long suppressed Indian society waking up and soaring to express itself
loudly and clearly using all the platforms of expression. The most expressive and near to reality was
theatre, the platform to express the nations numerous blunders, tragic moments, sore points, the curse of
inequality in the social and ﬁnancial order, emergence ofmany shades ofGovernment bureaucracy and
political hollowness. There was so much to see, so much to ponder about and so much to say - so much to
laugh at our own selfnot privately but spontaneously and together in a theater hall.
SATIRE AND COMEDY was the ﬁeld in which Three Arts dramatic productions excelled - to
laugh at your own self. The spectators laughed freely and loudly. This has given me a reason to
remember Shri Raja Kaul's untiring efforts, play wright and director, Shri Rarnesh Mehta's consistent
effort to give life to all those plays for more than 40 years. I would like to recollect the devoted
contribution of Shri Pran Nath and all those actors, backstage support and those who made the audience
enjoy every moment oftheir presence in the hall.
Isn't it great that deeper you are pricked, lounder you laugh? That is what the audience did then
and shall be doing during the forthcoming Drama Festival in May, 2008.
This effort to bring back the magic ofgone by days is very praiseworthy.

With warmest regards and good wishes.
