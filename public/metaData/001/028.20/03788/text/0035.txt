MESSAGE

It gives me great pleasure that Three Arts Club is being revived and staging
plays again in Delhi.

It was a pleasant surprise to know that Smt. Anuradha Dar has decided to
revive the club. This again is creditable and I wish her all the best in her endeavour.
I would also like to convey my best wishes to all the people who are supporting her

in this noble effort to give theatre a direction,just like Three Arts Club did over half
a century ago. Further, I also congratulate the whole team of artists associated with
the play, particularly Shri Govind Bajpai, our colleague, for success.
