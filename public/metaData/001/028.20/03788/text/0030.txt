I Many ofyou who are reading this may go as far as 'Muqaddar ka Sikanderâ€™ to talk about me as a
child artist, some that know me a bit more would remember me from my days of Delhi Doordarshan
when I was know as Master Raju and not Mayur. But very few may know that even though I was not

directly associated with the Three Arts Club, but my growth as an actor started from there! Barer at the
age of four when I used to accompany my actress mother Sneh Lata Verma, for her rehearsals, I was

unconsciously going through one ofthe best trainings an actor can get. Sitting in the readings. Watching
the enthusiasm and dedication of Kaul Uncle, Om Uncle and Ramesh Mehtaj i. Seeing how the

blockings are done, Facial expressions to hand movements to dialogue delivery and more than anything
the very intense and yet very pleasant family kind of atmosphere that one has experienced is hard to
describe. Three Arts Club is a chapter that is so important to me and many others who are very grateful to
have been associated with. Strange it may seem but I could have never dreamt that after over 30 years the
plays such as Wah Re Insaan and Badde Aadrni will be staged in London and I will be playing the
Characters that I had watched rehearse in the 60's ! My Heartiest Congratulations to Anuradha ji and all
others that are making all efforts ofreviving the Three Arts Club once again. I hope some day, I will get
to act in one of their productions so I can pay my tribute to the organization that made such a big

difference to my life.

I would also take this opportunity to express my happiness on the honour that Ramesh Mehtaji
have received recently. Atrue genius who I shall always salute and be proud of.

My best wishes to Three Arts Club and the new members.
