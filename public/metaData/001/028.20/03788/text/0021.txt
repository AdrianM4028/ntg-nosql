I am glad to know that my niece Anuradha Dar is reviving Raja Bhai-Kaul's famous and
popular Three Arts Club.
/

I rnyselfwas associated with stage theatre and dramas from 1938 to 1 962, on stage as well as AIR and
TV, besides my being substantially busy as a poet, Writer and Critic ofUrdu, Raja Bhai was a liveVOir
and the soul ofTheatre in Simla and Delhi.

The Three Arts Club was an asset to the cultural activities of Delhi for almost forty years. The Three
Arts Club superseded every other society and group in its zealous dramatic performance.

It's most commendable that Anuradha has come forward as a torch bearer of art to revive her father's
Three Arts Club. May God LordAlmighty, the "Natraj ", the "Saraswati" and the angles ofthe heaven
and the spirit ofLord "Indra" give her strength and support of colleagues and friends to reopen a new
chapter of the drama and theatre, in the 21st century and become a forerunner of the days gone by

i

once again.
I wish her all success and offer my blessings andbest wishes for her bold step.

With Love & Affection
