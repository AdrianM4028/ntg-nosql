Message

1 vividly recall in early 60s and 705 the Three Arts Club was very active. Infact, this cluster of
Mandi House, Karnani Auditorium, National School of Drama, Triveni and Lalit Kala Academy had

become the hub f cultural activities of the cosmopolitan city. I fondly remember those days when the
plays like Faisla, "Under Secretary", "Paisa Bolta Hai", "Dhong", "Harnara Gaon", "Roti aur Beti",

"Aur Bhagwan Dekhta Raha", "Uljhan" and "Bade Aadmi" were staged attracting packed appreciative
houses. Mr. Rarnesh Mehta guided by my predecessor Late Principal M.N. Kapur and late Sri. R.M.
Kaul with his team ofactors and actresses were regaling the theatre lovers.

I am delighted to learn that Mrs. Anuradha Dar is taking the hold initiative of reviving the Three
Arts Club and rekindling the pioneering role in the realm oftheatre in Delhi and its neighbourhood.

1 extend to Mrs. Dar and her associates all the best in reviving the Three Arts Club and
recapturing the glory it had once attained.

1 shall eagerly look forward to the revival ofthe three Arts Club.

With best wishes,
