I am really excited and happy to learn about the revival of 'Three Arts Club ', after
three decades.
'The Three Arts' Club was not just another theatre group. It was a movement that
believed and show-cased that theatre is essentially mass-based art for the people and
by the people. Theatre bereft ofaudience, done to please a few critics, with an eye on
government sponsored awards are rootless and ph0ny. A genuine theatre is in deep
centre of society and not on its margins and is supported by the society. The Three
Arts Club was one such rare theatre groups that thrived for about four decades A .
without grant-in-aid of even a single paisa from the Govt. It ﬂourished and set
standards with people support only. The "Three Arts Club' is unthinkable without remembering Shri Ramesh Mehta and
Late Shri R. M. Kaul. It was the team spirit and tireless effort ofthe duo that had taken
the group to the heights, never scaled by any other non-professional (but with
professional commitment) group in India so far.
I hope that the Three Arts Club is its present avatar with new team inspired by Shri
Mehta and Late Shri Kaul will also serve as a beacon light to many dole-dependent
and audience deprived theatre groups oftoday.
I wish all success to the new team of "Three Arts Club' and its play 'Bade Aadmi'
"
being staged in a festival ofplays of Shri Ramesh Mehtaat Delhi.
