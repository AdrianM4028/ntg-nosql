Our present day social life is a craze for
modernity which is not yet deﬁned or at
best ill deﬁned. We are all after a kind of
living that is imitative of western way of
life, which leaves us with fashion, but
without substance. Bade Aadmi is one
such victim of this craze. A comedy, the play
is a satire on our times. It is a story of a

family which tries to adopt a lifestyle in order
to impress others.
