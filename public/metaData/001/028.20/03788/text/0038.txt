Theatre since centuries has been a favoured art to express life.

just in India

but across the globe, theatre has existed,

Not

woven

intricately into the fabric of common life of people. Its potential to
unravel our world, to understand and explore its multiplicity and above
all, to provide hope amidst sorrow and fulfillment amidst loss, is
phenomenal. With theatre around us, active and vibrant, our world is
better and society healthier.

I am delighted that Mrs. Anuradha Dar daughter of one of the founder
members of the Three Arts Club, Late Shri. R. M. Kaul, has taken up
the responsibility of restoring glory to this prestigious club. This

occasion becomes even more memorable and significant as it marks
the death anniversary of Late Shri. Kaul.

I am confident that this initiative of Mrs. Dar ably assisted by Shri.

Ramesh Mehta, Dr. Sadhna Bhatnagar and Shri. D. C. Pandey, will be
received with eagerness by artists and audience
strengthen theatre movement in our country.
