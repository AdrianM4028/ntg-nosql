MESSAGE

I am extremely glad to know that the Three Arts Club is being revived and it will again work for

promotion of art and culture through dance, drama, music and other art forms. It is a matter of
delight that the club also proposes to extend its activities to educational institutions for promoting
histrionic skills among the new generation.
I am sure that with dynamism and hard work the club will fulﬁll the aspirations ofits founders and

key members — Late Shri Om Sharrna, Late Shri R.M. Kaul and Late Shri Devi Chand Kayasth and
Late Shri M .N. Kapur.

I am also conﬁdent that Ms. Anuradha Dar, with the support of Shri Ramesh Mehta, Dr. Sadhna
Bhatnagar and Shri D.C. Pandey, will do proud to the world of theatre and will take this glorious
journey forward.

I wish all the best to everyone who is involved in it revival and promotion.
