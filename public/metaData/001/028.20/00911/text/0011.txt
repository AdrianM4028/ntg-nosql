Producers Note

Drama in every generation has projected the true image of its
people and their national heritage.

It has kept pace with the cycle of time

. and mirrored the hOpes, short—comings. social upheavals and the shaping
and development of man’s personality in diﬁerent ages and times.

Three Arts Club while doing its bit for theatre movement in the
country has been keen to present plays from different regional languages

adopted in Hindi and we have already presented plays from Marathi,
Bengali and Telugu.

This time we are presenting a comedy for Gujrati.

It is a satire on the role of money in society.
