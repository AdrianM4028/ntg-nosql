It is very necessary in life to discriminate between good and evil. Those who fail
to do so come to grief. This play is about a greedy Sadhu and a foolish King. The

Sadhu tempted to stay on in a city in which everything is available at the same price very
cheaply. He lands himself in trouble and is about to be hanged. But his wise Guru not
only saves him but also creates a situation that the foolish King himself oﬁers to be hanged.
