In the capital city of Delhi, Delhi Children's Theatre is playing a vital role in the

training of children from different schools in social and cultural activities such as dance,
drama, music, mono-acting, ballet and group singing etc. These activities are essential for
emotional growth and for all round development of childâ€™s personality. They go a long way
in providing confidence and self-reliance to the children and as such they help them to
grow into responsible citizens.
Our first Prime Minister, late Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru was its great patron from the
beginning and always made it a point to attend its annual shows and as such provided
great inspiration and encouragement to children. Later on, our late Prime Minister,
Mrs. Indira Gandhi was its chief patron and always took keen interest in the welfare and
progress of this organisation. She attended its annual functions inspite of her extremely

busy programmes.

In February, 1982, she came to attend its cultural show for half an

hour but stayed back for the whole show of about 2 hours' duration. Another great
patron of DDT has been Mrs. Kamla Devi Chattopadhya who took very active interest in
the activities of DDT. Mr. Raiiv Gandhi, present Prime Minister of India has also attended
our functions with his wife, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi. Other dignatories, who have been
attending the shows of D.C.T. on different occasions are Shri Hidayatullah, ex VicePresident, several Union Ministers and Lt. Governors of Delhi.
D.C.T. has opened its training centres in some schools of South Delhi to provide
training to children of all ages in cultural and social activities. These centres are run
throughout the year. It is difficult to mention the names of all the artists who have been
training children at these centres. However, the names of Mrs. Sujata Dinesh and Mrs.
Rekha Jain stand out prominently in this sphere.
