FO R E WO R D
A tiny acorn which was planted in 1954, as an experimental group venture,
towards Creative Drarnatics with a few children of the age-group of seven and twelve
years has now developed over the years into a mighty tree.
As years grow by an organisation grows old and sturdy but not aged or infirm.

It continues to gain sustenance from all that it produces and it desires to live for and its
aspirations to develop the Movement in future.

Today my memory goes back with nostalgic feeling to that day thirty one years

ago, when Delhi Children's Theatre celebrated its First Children's Theatre Festival in the
Gymnasium Hall of Lady lrwin School on Canning Road in collaboration with a few
enthusiastic schools who joined hands with us in this venture.

I do not wish to highlight the success achieved or the disappointment suffered
by the Organisation while traversing through these long years. That have been set out in
the Annual Reports of Delhi Children’s Theatre brought out regularly from year to year.
With a humble beginning Delhi, Children’s Theatre has spread its activities all
over Delhi. Let, therefore, the mounting stature of such a sturdy growth bring perennial
happiness to all concerned.
