I am glad to know that the Delhi Children's
Theatre is celebrating the Thirtieth

Annual Children's

Festival on February 6, to 10 this year.
The Theatre has done a pioneering work in

promoting art education amongst the school children
and I am sure the present celebration will give further

encouragement and inspiration to this organisation to
work more vigorously and with dedication for its
laudable cause in the years to com&

My best wishes to the Delhi Children's Theatre
for the continued success of its endeavours.
