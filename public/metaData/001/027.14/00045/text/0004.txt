The Delhi Childrens Theatre is a voluntary Organisation working in the field of
child development for the last 30 years. It was established in the year 1954 with the

blessings and patronage of the late Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, then The Prime Minister of
India. This year we complete Thirty-years of performing in Art, Music, Dance Er Drama
among the Children in the age group of 5 to 15, particularly belonging to families of
modest lncorne group.
This year our Annual Festival is being held for 4 days from 6th Feb. to 10th Feb.
at Mavalanker Auditorium. The young participants will put up 3 colour full shows in
the course of the day and present cultural and thematic items in the form of dance and

I drama ballet etc.
The Delhi Childrens Theatre runs more than six Training Centres regularly during
the year in different schools of Delhi offering training to the young Children under the
guidance of trained professional choreographers and music directors.

The production of the centres run by the Delhi Childrens Theatre and also by other
institutional members of the Organisation are regularly being presented at their annual
festivals for the benefit of the young children and their parents. It is expected that every
day more than six thousand children will have the opportunity for witnessing our grand
shows presented by the children for children. The governing Body of the Delhi Childrens
Theatre will invite young boys and girls belonging to the depressed areas of the city to
witness their shows for which no gate fee will be collected from them.
