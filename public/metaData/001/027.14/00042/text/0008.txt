DANCE DRAMA

M IT H UA
The theme of the dance drama "Mithua" is the story of a sweet nine years old
girl mithu who though sick and bedridden for last one year is a symbol of hope

and imagination, friendship and happiness. When the world sleeps at midnight
everything around her become alive - The street below with lamp posts, letter
boxes, telephone boxes and sky above with moon and stars to give company and
happiness to sleepless mithu.

The Fairies overwhelm by her simplicity and her faith in the goodness of
everybody cure her of all sufferings to make her happy for ever.
