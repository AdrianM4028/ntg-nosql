Seeing the Republic Day. our children have been so
enamoured by it, that they will
show you glimpses of the colourful parade and
pageant. We have, however, gone off
protocol and the president’s carriage will follow the contin
gents of the 3 Services — the
Army. Navy and Air force.
The freedom fighters to whom we owe our freedom will
march in, followed by the
brave children who with their deeds of bravery will find others
also wanting to emulate
them.

The Lazuim, which dates back to the days of the great Maratha Leader—
Shivaji will
form the next contingent,
They are followed by the Rajasthani Dancers, resplendent in their flowing colourful
ghagras and odnis, heralding the arrival of Basant—the Spring season
.
