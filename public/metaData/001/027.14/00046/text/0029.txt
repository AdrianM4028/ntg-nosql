Household Hints
To keep glass lugs and water bottles crystal clear, wash them in a mixture of salt and
tea leaves dissolved in a little water.

Washing with potato peels, crushed egg shells,

or woodash will also give a shine.
Aluminium that has turned black will regain its original colour if potato peels are boiled
in the stained vessel. Wash in warm soapy water.
Metalware cups and plates when stained should be cleaned with a wet cloth dipped

in baking powder.

Rub gently over the stain.

Tinware can be made to shine by cleaning in a solution of hot water and soda and then
rubbing with a slice of raw onion.

Enamel trays, mugs of pails can be cleaned by first washing with soap and water and
then sprinkling with flour.

Rub hard with a soft duster.

Plates which are stained should be cleaned by sprinkling salt over the stains and then
rubbing with a cork.

Dampen salt slightly if necessary.
