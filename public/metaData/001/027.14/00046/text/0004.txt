The year 1986 has ushered in the 32nd year of the DC T.
creative dramatics is now blossoming into a healthy plant.

The method of teaching is primarily based on rhymes and rhythms and free movement
so that natural musical sense of the children is developed.

Most of our children are very

young and it is for the first time in their lives, that they are learning to set their steps to
music. Yet it is a surprise to the parents and the Organisers to find how easily the children
respond to the rhymes and rhythms which the Professionals learn in months and years.

This has given the Organisers of DCT great confidence and we have opened centres in
many schools.

The first festival of DCT was held in Delhi in 1955 which was then graced by our
late Prime Minister, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru.

The entire crowd of youngsters sat on the

floor. Even our Honoured guest with his young daughter, Indira Gandhi sat on the floor
in the midst of children. Panditjee then sent a cheque for Rs. 15,000 being his contribution for the establishment of OCT halls in Delhi.

However, 32 years later we are still

struggling for a little place where we can regularly teach our children music. dance, drama
and ballet. I hope with the cooperation of all we will soon be successful. There is no
doubt that by our humble teachings, the children will get access to the living tradition of
our art and culture.
