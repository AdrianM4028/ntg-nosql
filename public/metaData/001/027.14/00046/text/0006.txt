DELHI CHILDRENâ€™S THEATRE
Delhi Children's Theatre is a voluntary organisation working in the field of children for 30
years. It is our object to make children as happy as possible and to let them develop a
healthy mind and body. They are taught music, drama, dance, mime and general knowledge by highly qualified teachers, choreographers and music directors. We generally take
themes with a moral or educational message for the child not only to enrich their aesthetic
sense but also to develop their moral character.

The DCT owns .72 acres (3500 sq. yards) out of which for our Training Centre we will be
using only 1100 sq. yards which will be a small beautiful building and there will be enough
open ground for the resident's children to play.
It is sad to note that some people are misguiding the residents of this educated and cultuo

red colony, by spreading rumours against us. in the long run all the residents wili greatly
benefit as they can send their growing children especially girls for cultural training in their
own neighbourhood which was the aim of the Government in allotting this land to DCT.
We hope you will c00perate whole-heartedly with us.
