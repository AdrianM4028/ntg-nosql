work in a distant place, However, she warns him to stay away from Rangla, a known bad
character. On his way, he falls hungry and sits near a well and opens the food packet
given to him by his wife. He wonders how many chappatis he should eat—one, two, three
or all. Inside the well was the abode of fairies. On hearing the old man count his
chappatis they get frightened thinking that he was counting the number of fairies he would
catch They go to him, beg him to spare them, and present him with a magic basket which
gives food on reciting a mantra, The old man goes back home happily but on way Rangla
steals his basket. He turns back to the fairies who give him a magic stick, With the help
of the stick he takes revenge on Rangla and gets back his basket.
