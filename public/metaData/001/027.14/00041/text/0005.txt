MESS AGE

I am happy to learn that the
Delhi Children 3 Theatre are going
to celebrate their Silver Jubilee
Year from '50th April to 6th May 1979.
It is a happy coincidence that the
celebrations are taking place in the

International Year of the Child.

The members of the Delhi Children's

'

Theatre deserve our praise for their

pioneering work in the field of art
education among the children of the age

Such training
group of five to twelve.
and"upbringing of these small children
in‘ the field of art and onl‘ture and making

them useful citizens will earn the

Theatre

a name for themselves, apart from the
'
‘
self-satisfaction for the nob ’-

they have undertaken. t
