(Ballet based on Uday Shankar’s School of Daric‘fn‘gj‘LiéCuw—nmg,
, .

The story of the dance
The ballet opens with the chorus lauding Shiva and his divine wife, Sati. The
occurrence which precedes the enactments on the state is that Sati, symbolizing conjugal
ﬁdelity, died being aggrieved of the bad behaviour of her father towards her husband,
Shiva, who retired to solitude, with the result, all creation stopped. Sati in her subsequen t birth as Parvathi, symbolizing the Earth, implores Shiva to continue the creation.

The drama starts with Parvati approaching Shiva and trying to rouse him. Meanwhile the earth has been threatened by Gajasura, the elephant-demon. One day, beholding

Parvathi’s youth and beauty, he decides to seduce her.

He enacts his powers before her.

Parvathi, frightened, repulses him and when he is about to , carry her pﬂ'_ by force, she

throws herself? at the feet of Shiva, irnploring his aid. Shiva awakes and the earth trembles
at his challenge. ' Gajasura- Shiva combat starts in which divine weapons clash and clang,
ﬁlling the sky with mighty ' echoes. They hurl at each other the ﬁ‘Ve elementsi,'.,the'win‘d,
the lightning, the writhing forces of the earth, ﬁery atmosphere and ﬂaming

Shiva

employs even the serpents on his arms which, in the air, seem to rush like bleeding tempest. Parvathi, the embodiment of ‘shakti’, the power house of eternal energy, stands: by
valiant, reinforcing her devine mate with invicible weapons. Finally, Shiva, taking the
club given to him by Lord Vishnu, kills Gajasura, and stripping the hide off"'the demon,
dances with Parvathi an .३ ecstatic dance of triumph inter-woven with the dance of the
I universal movement and he ﬁnally dances himself into an aeon of meditation, .surcharged

with the thoughts of Sati, who has reincarnated into Parvati.
