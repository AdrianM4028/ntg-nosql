“Phool Pari” is an adaptation of Han’s Anderson’s fairy tale
‘Thumbalina’. It is the story of the little girl of the ﬂowers who ﬁnds
herself discarded to the ugly world of frogs, moles and rats. But the
delicate butterﬂies, the silver ﬁshes and the little bird rescue her back
to the world of ﬂowers, where the handsome Prince of the ﬂowers

wooes her and they live happily ever after.
