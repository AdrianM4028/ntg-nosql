“Maya Nagari”

King Midas was not only an unjust ruler but was also very greedy. He wanted to
accumulate the maximum amount of gold on earth and turn everything of his kingdom

into gold. For this he prayed day and night. One day he was granted a boon that
whatever thing he would touch will change into gold. But to his astonishment and
surprise, food, water and even his daughter changed into gold. At last he realised his
mistake and begged God to release him from the curse—the so-_ called boon.
This opened
his eyes, and changed him into a just and kind ruler and to live happily ever after.

Presented by
Cambridge Preparatory School No. 4

The play is about the proverbial ‘Andher Nagari’, which is ruled over by a foolish
king who has peculiar notions of administration, justice and economy. This chaotic city
is visited by a sage and his two disciples. The city’s apparent charms lure
the disciples
and they decide to forsake their master and stay on there. Not long before, they
are in
trouble and their very lives are threatened. Luckily, the sage happens to
arrive on the
scene and they are rescued by him. The King and citizens of ‘Andhe
r Nagari’ also learn i
a lesson and decide to change for the better.
