“Raja Rani Ko Chahiye Pasina”
Presented by
Bal Bhavan Repertory Theatre Children
There was a king who spent all his time enjoying himself and had
no knowledge what was happening in his kingdom. He had everything
and yet he had nothing as he was issueless. The court doctor gave
him a medicine which had to be mixed with the man’s sweat and only

then he could have the heir to his throne

The king and queen set

out and after roaming all over his kingdom he dis'covered that sweat
can only be got after hard work. Then he realised that since he
had never worked hard how could the people in his kingdom work at
all. So he wanted to punish himself so that his subjects could follow
the right path.
