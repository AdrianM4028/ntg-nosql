“The Chatisement of Narada”
Presented by
Bal Bharati Air Force School

One day, Brahma, the Creator, who taught music to Narada for dissemination
among the Devas paid a visit to Gandharva-Lok and was mortiﬁed to see the six original
Ragas lying with broken limbs each bemoaning his fate.
Brahma immediately divined the cause of their misery and summoning Narada to
his presence chided him for his presumption and cut him to size, placed a donkey’s head
on his shoulders.

The now-sobered Narada hung his head in shame before Brahma and promised to
sing the Ragas according to their correct forms and consequently they were restored to

their prestine glory and eminence.
