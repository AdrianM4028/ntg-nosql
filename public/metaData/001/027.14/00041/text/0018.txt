amuni, the
Sindhu was extremely devoted to his father Andh
blind sage.

Sarayu.

One day, the sage sent him to fetch water from river

On way the forest Angels warned him of the danger being

caused by bad weather.

But he was determined.

Coincidently, King Dasrata was on a hunting mission to the
forest. He was chasing a deer. Suddenly he hears some sound in the
water. Mistaking it as that of deer drinking water he shoots an arrow
in that direction, which hit Sindhu who was drawing water. The
dying Sindhu pleads the King to carry the water to his blind father.
You will now see how the sage reacts to the outrage of the King

Dasrata and courses him before himself dying out of shock.

Demons Hiranyakashyapu and Hiranyashu were brothers.

When

Lord Vishnu killed Hiranyashu, his brother had vowed to avenge it by
destroying Lord Vishnu and his devotees. But all his attempts proved
futile.
Hiranyakashyapu then goes into ‘tapas’ to attain greater power

and strength than Lord Vishnu. Ultimately Brahma grants his wishes.
