Message
I am glad to learn that the Delhi Children's Theatre is organising its
Silver Jubilee Celebrations from 30th April to 6th May, 1979. It has added
importance in as much as it coincides with the International Year of the Child.
The Delhi Children's Theatre has been doing commendable work in the
field of art education, which is very important for developing the creative talents
of our children.

I congratulate the Chairman, the Management and the Staff for their
dedicated work and wish them all success in their future endeavours.
