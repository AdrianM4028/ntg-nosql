Once upon a time there was a lazy King who was fond of good
eats and rest. His cunning nephew took advantage of this weakness
and exploited him and also ill-treated the people.

One day the King asked for some fruits, but the gardener regretted
that all the fruits were eaten away by parrots. The nephew immediately ordered to catch all parrots and teach them. His real intension
was something else! However, they were able to catch only a young
parrot, and, still worse, all their efforts to teach the parrot proved
futile.

Fed up, they stuffed the lessons into the parrm’s mouth, and the
poor parrot died. Throwing it away in a garden the teachers hurrie-

dly left the place.

But the cunning nephew reported to the King

that the parrot had reached heaven because of high learning.

At last, Angels appear in the garden and carry the soul of the
'
parrot to heaven.
