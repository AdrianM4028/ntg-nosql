Once upon a time there was a King and his Queen. Their daughter's name
was Phul Kurnari. Phul Kurnari had a habit of laughing aloud whenever she felt
happy. On one such occasion the king was enraged and enquired why she should

laugh so aloud.

On hearing this Phul Kurnari became sad for ever. All attempts to

make her happy and smile proved futile. Ultimately the king announced that
whoever could bring smile to her face w0uld be married to the princess. On hearing
this many people came to entertain her. One of them was a clown who with his
acrobatics made Phul Kurnari laugh again. Suddenly everybody saw that the clown
was a prince in disguise. Phul Kumari was married to him and everybody was
happy.
