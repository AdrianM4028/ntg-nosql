Once upon a time, there lived seven fairies in a country ruled by a king
and his queen. When these fairies heard that the queen’s dearest desire was to
have a child they decided to grant her wish.
A princess was :born. . The . happy king ordered a grand feast where the

guests of honour were the wise fairies, but by some mistake one of the fairies had
been omitted from the guest list. Angered by it, ' the seventh fairy cursed the
princess: “On your sixteenth birthday you will prick yourself with a needle
and die."
'
Fortunately, this I happened" before the sixth fairy bestowed her gift. She
stepped forward and said : “l decree that this death which shall befall you, be not
death at all, but a deep sleep which will last a hundred years."
That very day the hundred years were over, a prince happened to visit the
castle. ३ He ‘ saw the beautiful princess lying on the bed. As his lips touched
her pale cheek, the princess awoke from her deep sleep.
The spell was broken.

The castle came to life once again.
