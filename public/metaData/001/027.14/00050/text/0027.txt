Changes in technology reﬂecting
changes in industrial patterns.
Nothing remains static behind
this symbal. The thinking
process goes on generating vas

resources of technical knowhow and manufacturing आंकी.
It started in 1938 when two
engineers applied their minds
to manufacturing dairy
equipment. Today we are
about 10.000 people involved
in manufacturing plant and
equipment for every major
industry from dairy to nuclear.
Tomorrow we'll be vastly
diﬁ‘erent from what we are
today. Because things are never
static behind this symbol.
