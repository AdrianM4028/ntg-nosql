The play set in second world war is a reﬂection and expression of several forces, seriously meant and relevant to both
domestic lives and daily work. An experience which widens
the awareness of connection. The crime is not one that is

about to be committed but one that has long since been committed as having roots in certain relationship ofindividual
to society. It. is an assertion not so much ofmorality in terms
of right or wrong but of a moral world’s being such because

men cannot walk away from certain of their deeds. The play is designed to bring a man into direct path of the conse— '

quences he has wrought.
