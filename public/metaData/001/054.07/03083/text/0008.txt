THE

UNITED

FRUIT

CO.

When the trumpets had sounded and all
was in readiness on the face of the earth,
Jehovah divided his universe:
Anaconda, Ford Motors,
Coca-Cola Inc., and similar entities:
the most succulent item of all,
The United Fruit Company Incorporated
reserved for itself: the heartland
and coasts of my country,
the delectable waist of America.
They rechristened their properties:
the “Banana Republics"—
and over the languishing dead,
the uneasy repose of the heroes
who harried that greatness,
their ﬂags and their freedoms,

they established an opéra bouﬂe:
they ravished all enterprise,
awarded the laurels like Caesars,
unleashed all the covetous, and contrived
the tyrannical Reign of the Flies—
Trujillo the ﬂy, and Tacho the fly,
the flies called Carias, Martinez,

Ubico—all of them flies, ﬂies
dank with the blood of their marmalade
vassalage, ﬂies buzzing drunkenly
on the populous middens:
the fly-circus fly and the scholarly
kind, case-hardened in tyranny.
Then in the bloody domain of the ﬂies
The United Fruit Company Incorporated
sailed oil with a booty of coflee and fruits
brimming its cargo boats, gliding
like trays with the spoils
of our drowning dominions.
