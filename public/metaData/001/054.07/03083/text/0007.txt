I would answer you: the Ocean knows it—the arc of its lifetime
is vast as the sea-sand, ﬂawless and numberless.
Between cluster and cluster, the blood and the vintage, time
brightens
the ﬂint in the petal, the beam in the jellyﬁsh;
the branches are threshed in the skein of the coral
from the inﬁnite pearl of the horn.
1 am that not waiting emptily—out of range

of the onlooker, slain in the shadows,
ﬁngers inured to a triangle, a timid
half-circle’s dimensions computed in oranges.
Probing a starry inﬁnitude,
I came, like yourselves,
