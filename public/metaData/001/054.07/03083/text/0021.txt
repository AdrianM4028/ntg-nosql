The Royal Hunt of the Sun

To the Spanish sentries, the Inca camp-fires on the distant
hillside seemed like “a starry sky, a menacing thing. All were
full of fear, for we were so few and so deep in the land where
we could not be reinforced." As the vast Inca army spread
over the plain "many Spanish soldiers wet their pants from
terror without noticing it,” Pedro Pizarro, Francisco’s cousin,
recalled.

Conferring with his officers, Pizarro devised a stratagern
of surprise. Mounted on horseback, the Spaniards would
conceal themselves in public buildings that surround a triangular walled plaza, with an entrance at the apex. the Indians
would be lured into this trap; the Spaniards would encircle
the Inca king, kidnap him, and hold him hostage.
On Saturday, November 16, 1532, around sundown, Atahuallpa, believing that horses would be useless after dark,

moved in stately procession towards the Spanish camp, preceded by scores of singers and dancers. They all came unarmed, having ﬂung down their weapons in full sight of the
watching Spanish soldiers. The king’s entourage was decked
out in colourful costumes, and his nobles wore gold and
silver discs on their head bands. Seated on a golden litter
decorated with parrot feathers Atahuallpa entered the empty
plaza, where an eerie silence reigned, and called: "Where are
they?”

Then the Dominican Friar Vincente de Valverde appeared
in his white cassock and black hood, holding in one hand his
staff with the cross, and in the other a prayerbook, and held
forth at great length on the Christian account of the creation
of the world, the fall of Adam and Eve, the birth, life, cruci—

fixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and on the history of

the Church. He called upon the "unbaptised pagan” to acknowledge the supremacy of the Pope, the Church and the
King of Spain under pain of punishment and divine retribution.
