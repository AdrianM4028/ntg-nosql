see where the depths lead l it is this way: as if
to your rnagnitude’s measure,
death’s perfectness came in the quick of a holocaust;
as if, from the ravage
of drillers, the crimson pilasters
and staggered ascents of the aqueducts,
you veered out of plumb, indivisibly
dying, and crashed like an autumn.
The hollow of air will lament you no longer,
nor acknowledge the chalk of your footfalls;
your cruses that ﬁltered the sky
brimming the light with a sunburst of knives,
are forgotten; the power that lives in the tree
is devoured by the haze and struck down by the wind.
Suddenly, out of the summits, into utterrnost time,
the hand that it cradled has t0ppled.
All that Spidery linger-play, the gimcrack
device of the ﬁbers, the meshes’ entanglements—you have put
them behind.
All that you were, falls away: habits, tatterdemalion
syllables, the blinding personae of light.
