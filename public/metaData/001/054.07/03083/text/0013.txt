DEATH OF THE INCA
A 'I’AHUALLPA
based on contemporary accounts

During the reign of Atahuallpa’s father, Huayna
Capac (1493-1527), evil omens presaged disasters to
come. The moon was circled by strange halos; the
earth quaked; mountains disappeared; the palace was struck
by lightning, and an angle hurtled dead on to the roof of a
sacred temple. A weird green comet appeared in the sky.
The book by the Jesuit, Father Bernabé Cobo, Historia del

Nuevo Mundo (History of the New World), is regarded by
historians as the most accurate and complete account of Inca
culture in existence. He recounts, "The riches that were gathered in the city of Cuzco alone, as capital and court of the
Empire, were incredible, for therein were many palaces of
dead kings, with all the treasure that each had amassed in

life; and he who had begun to reign did not touch the estate
and wealth of his predecessor, but built a new palace, and
acquired for himself silver and gold and all the rest.” The
Incas regarded gold as "the sweat of the sun” and silver as
"the tears of the moon. ”

The removal of silver and gold from Cuzco was prohibited.
"Nor was it spent in things that are consumed with use, ” but
for temple decorations, votive figures and ritual vessels.
Money was not a form of exchange; services were paid for
with food and clothing.
