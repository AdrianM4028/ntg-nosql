Pizarro ’s Wound

The wound in Pizarro’s side that will not heal is the Christian idea of Original Sin. That wound which Pizarro got while
destroying the ’natives’ in his search for gold will eventually
be his undoing. Original Sin is greed, the lust for power. Gold
turns to dross. "Fame is long; but death is longer.”

This play is a cry of conscience. It seeks to atone for the
evils wrought by the West by a form of self-scrutiny. Pizarro
opts out of his society; he opts out of his religious faith. In the
jungles of Peru, among the Inca, he overcomes his fear of
death through recognition of and submission to a moral
order which prevails in the universe beyond time and space,
and to the retribution it exacts.
