and llama-boys; gaunt
virgins that languish in sacristies,
parochial schoolmasters
b l u e-fa ce d and h u nger-m a r ke d .
Narcotic with dancing,
stamping their feet on invisible
drums, the negroes moved on
in their amethyst nightgowns.
A country was beating its breastbone—

the whole of Peru, with its gaze
on an idol, sky-blue and roseate,
our lady of niceties
parting their heads like a sea
in her shallop of marmalade
and swelling a sweltering air.

THE

E N l G M A S

You would know what the crab weaves in the gold of its claws,
and I answer: Ocean will say it.
You ask what the luminous bell of the sea-squirt awaits in the
water: what
does it hope for? I tell you, it waits for the fullness of time, like
yourself.
For whom does the alga Macrocystis extend its embraces?
Unriddle it, riddle it out, at a time, in a sea that I know.
And the narwhal’s malevolent ivory? though you turn for my
answer, I tell you

you stay for a stranger reply; how he suffered the killing harpoon.
Or you look, it may be, for the kingﬁsher’s plumage, a pulsation
of purest beginning in the tropical water.
Now, on the lucid device of the polyp you tangle
a new importunity, flailing it ﬁne, to the bran:
you would sift the electrical matter that moves on the tines of the
void;
the stalactite’s splintering armor that lengthens its crystal;
the barb of the angler ﬁsh, the singing extension
that weaves in the depths and is loosed on the waters?
