Death of the Inca — Atahuallpa

Soto delivered his speech from horseback without dismounting, but Atahuallpa just ignored him. Hernando Pizarro,
Francisco Pizarro’s half-brother then arrived, and identifying
himself as “the brother of the Governor” seemed to arouse
some interest in the Inca king. Before leaving, De Soto once
again tried to unnerve the king. He charged full tilt on
horseback at Atahuallpa, as if to run him down, then reined

in his steed at the last moment. But the Inca sat impassively
on his stool, without flinching.
