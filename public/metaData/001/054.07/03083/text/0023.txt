The Royal Hunt of the Sun

worked day and night reducing the priceless art and religious objects of a 2000 year civilization to molten metal. Each
foot-soldier received 45 pounds of gold and ninety pounds
of silver; each cavalry man got twice that weight; De Soto four
times; Hernando Pizarro seven times, and Francisco Pizarro
thirteen times that weight, plus Atahuallpa’s golden litter

which alone weighed 200 pounds.
Despite the payment of the agreed ransom, Atahuallpa

was not freed. False charges of treason against the Spanish
looters in his own kingdom were levelled against him; a
hastily summoned Spanish court found him guilty, and sentenced him to death by burning at the stake. Horrified at the
thought that, reduced to ashes, his body would be denied

rnumrnification (as required by Inca ritual) and after-life and

resurrection, Atahuallpa agreed to the other horrific alternative of being garotted (strangulated) after receiving baptism
at the hands of the friar Valverde. Ironically, he was given

the name Francisco, in deference to the man who had brought
about his downfall.
The death of Atahuallpa signalled the decline of the Inca
Empire.
Pizarro was granted the title of Marquis by Charles I. In
Lima, one Sunday in 1541, armed Spaniards attacked the 63

year old conquistador; a sword point pierced his throat. He
was buried that night by candlelight in an obscure corner of
a church.
De Soto returned to Spain.
Friar Valverde, now Bishop of Cuzco, fled on hearing of

Pizarro’s assassination. He got as far as Ecuador, but was
killed by cannibals near the place where he had first set foot
on Inca soil.

The quest for Inca gold continues till today.
