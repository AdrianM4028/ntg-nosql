Since this attribute is the prerogative of all human beings, it is not surprising that
Ionesco should have been criticised by everyone. T h is however, does not prevent him
from t0uching the wound of our society, a society that imposes the idea of happiness
on its individuals, in spite of themselves, in the name of an ideology.
