Presentation of the Characters

M ARGU ERI TE

The naive, religious and simpleton Marguerite presents herself as the wife and proudly
so of the General. For her the potatoe (5) represent an entire being in which she lives

enclosing an escapism to the realities of life, so much so that she Cloisters herself in her
kitchen, a shelter from the world threatened by atomic destruction.
THE GENERAL :
ofﬁcers :

The main actor of this play is a cliché of the high ranking military

The General.

The human dimension of this role is shown by the paradoxes of a man, Who on one hard

aspires to dominate and accumulate power and the other a man who succumbs nevertheleLS

to be dominated himself—a result of a total brainwash.

His delirious and Prophetic

personality is more so emphasized by his fear of a nuclear Apocalypse, which explains his
reluctance to have children.

the end to be working against him, She is the disturbing but liberating factor in the
life of the Mouron couple. She will liberate the General from the vicious circle of power
and submission enabling him thereafter to lead the life of a \common man !

But will it

make any difference... !
