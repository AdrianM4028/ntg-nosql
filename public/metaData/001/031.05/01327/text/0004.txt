GAULAN (Song of the Milkrnaids)

Pots filled with milk and pots filled with curd
Lot on our heads and lo!
On to the Mathura Bazaar off we go! (all we go)

Krishna's the beloved lord of us maids
and Radha the fair jewel
Shining brilliantly like a moon noble
Pitchers on the pots and pots on the pots
And potful we carry with lot of pleasure
Some take our curd and some loot our curd
And some take the milk our priceless treasure
Look! Naughty Krishna standing in the Manik
C howk

Wickedly barring our way ..
Patthe Bapurao, poet of poets sings a new
tune each day ....

PADA (Song)
0 my love! My Kotwal!
Take my heart, my soul
My very being, take all!
0 my love, Kotwall
These eyes forever have dreamt of you
My prize, my sighs, my life are you!
I'll serve you to my dying day

Serve you I Shall!
O my love, Kotwall
Put me in handcuffs if that's what you will
Tame me to your jail, with love please kill!
l'll live in happiness!
In that thrall

O my love ! Kotwall
VIRAHA CHI LA VAN/ (Song of Separation)

Why so cruel is this longing, darling
Raya, my soul is pining, darling
Jasmine fragrant eager and waiting

Marigold at the door keeps on peeping
