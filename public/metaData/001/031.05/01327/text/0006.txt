GANA - A prayer to Lord Ganapati, firstly to
remove all obstacles in giving a good performance,

and secondly to invest the performance with rang,
a special quality that takes us beyond mere

entertainment.

'

MUJFiA - Maidens dance to greet the audience.

GAULAN- In this musico-dramatic phase, Krishna,
his friend Pendya, rnilkrnaids, rnaushi (Aunty) sing,
dance and comment humorously as well as
satirically on social and political issues.

VAG - It contains a dramatized story with a plot,
easy to follow and flexibly constructed.

KATA V
A running metre called katav is employed for the
narratives to link episodes and moods. Fast

moving, alliterative and full of assonance, the
katav-s are sung by the Shahir and his
accompanists. Their rendering remains
tantalizingly on the border of prose, poetry and
music. Five such katav-s appear at dramatically
important junctures in the play.
