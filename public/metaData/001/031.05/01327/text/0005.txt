Flames in the lamp too burning
Scent in the mango grove inviting
Bamboo flute sweetly enticing
Patthe Bapurao grace seeking

DHOLAKICH/ LA VANI (Lavani sung to the

accompaniment of Dholaki)
Winsome this face of thine! O beloved mine!

Hazel eyes shine! Making me pine ...
Winsome ...... winsorne ....l!
Wanton look that delights! Amorous in her guise
Flows on, rows of pearls gleaming!

Smile that is beaming
Caressing sensuous voice!
Triumphant in her poise!
Soft robes lovingly clinging! Laughter too ringing!

Standing in that balcony yonder!
The comely maiden! With gems she's laden!
gladdens me ....
Winsome ... winsome....!!

LA GNA CHI LA VANI (Wedding Song)
Marriage drums are beating
Merry my heart is racing
Mirthful music floating
From the band, band, band
Lovely the bride so charming

Onto the altar climbing
Clink, clink bangles chiming
"therhand,hand,hand
Look! The confetti sparkling
Rice and coconuts crackling

High up the fireworks dazzling
Looks so grand, grand, grand
