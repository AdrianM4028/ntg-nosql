Dl R E CTO R' S NOTE
Theatre, for me. is not merely entertainment.
I like my productions to speak about human
values. philosophy, joys, sorrows and experiences.
It does not mean that entertainment takes a

backseat in my presentations. It remains the core
of my work.

i believe that a play should be able to communicate 100% of what one wants to say and therefore the director is duty bound to simplify it.
We cannot categorise the audience. It has never
been my intention to attract only a particular set
of people. My plays are meant for one and all.
An English translation of a Marathi play, ’TEMPT
ME NOT’ aims at getting India's cultural heritage
closer to the English speaking population. We are
getting increasingly distanced from our roots. This
play attempts to bridge the gap. It was my
endeavour to get the new generation to see
this play.
