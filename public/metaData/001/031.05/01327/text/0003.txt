'TEMPT ME NOT !'
World over folk forms attract because they bring
down barricades of all kinds! Distinctions between
the eternal and the topical themes, pre-written and
spontaneous dialogues, conventional and
improvised acting disappear. A pervasive spirit of

freedom, accommodation and frankness appeals
irrespective of creed, caste and education.
'Iamasha of Maharashtra is a good example.
'l'empt Me Not !' attempts to translate into English
the performing culture of tamasha. In it traditional
robust rhythms, swift and sweet tunes, enthusing
movements, traditional costumes and uninhibited
abhinaya of the tamasha are maintained .
Through the representative characters of Havaldar
(common man) , Pradhanji (bureaucracy), Raja
('rubber stamp' leadership) and Maina (love and
art), 'T'empt Me Not!‘ makes satirical comments on
social ills such as corruption, nepotism, lack of
work - ethic with wit and humour.

GANA (Invocation to Lord Ganapati)

Come dance with us Ganesha dear thou!
Son of Mother Parvati
Heavenly Sharada descend here thou
Watches Goddess Mighty
Shree Ganesh fair, my Lord 0 Sire
At your door, we seek your blessing
With your sweet grace, we carry our plays

Melodiously through evening we sing
Come yea, O Lord, my gracious to me,

My music, my song be blessed by thee
, thee, thee,
