Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
and his drama “Faust”
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749—1832) is
almost certainly the best known German writer,
famed and recognised worldwide. Posterity
named an epoch after him, the Goethe Era

and sensual pleasure. The first edition of the
book was quickly sold out. A second edition
was brought out and the book was translated
into Danish, Dutch, French and English. When
the book reached England, the great dramatist
