Peter Brook on Theatre
“The theatre must not be dull. It must not be
conventional. It must be unexpected. Theatre leads
us to truth through surprise, through excitement,
through games, through joy. It makes the past and
the future part of the present, it gives us a distance
from what normally envelops us and abolishes the
distance between us and what is normally far away.
A story from today’s newspapers can suddenly
seem much less true, less intimate than something
from another time, another land. It is the truth of

the present moment that counts, the absolute sense
of conviction that can only appear when a unity

binds performer and audience. This appears when
the temporary forms have served their purpose
and have brought us into this single, unrepeatable
instant when a door opens and our vision is

transformed.”
—from “The Open Door”
