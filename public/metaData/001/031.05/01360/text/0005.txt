perceived the explosive nature of the subject
and wrote a drama “The Tragical History of
Dr. Faustus”.
Goethe became acquainted with “Faust” during
his childhood and youth by means of popular
books and marionette theatre, and the subject
fascinated him throughout his life. In 1772 the
old Frankfurt am Main supplied the young
Goethe with more material for thought with
the pompous execution of an infant—killer. The
“Gretchen" tragedy contained in the “Faust”
drama took shape from major thoughts inspired
by this event.
Goethe‘s complete “Faust" (written in two
parts) presents a worldly event between God
and Mephistopheles demonstrated in one single
human: Faust. He shows himself as a type of
outsider, compared with his fellow humans,
in his boundless longings and desires, in his
unlimited wish to comprehend life, in his
failure and guilt. The “Prologue in Heaven"
opens the drama with a wager between the
and the Devil for Faust’s soul.
Lord
Mephistopheles wishes to bind Faust to evil
by means of lust and sin: God has faith that
the “right way” will prevail, has faith in the
goodness of man. Mephistopheles works on
Faust who is unsatisfied with life due to his
inner struggle and at times thinks of suicide.
A blood pact is agreed between the two:
Mephistopheles promises to lead Faust through
all the heights and depths of life, and Faust
has in return to serve him in the afterworld.
His pact is to end on that day on which Faust
says, “Linger a while, thou art so fair".
