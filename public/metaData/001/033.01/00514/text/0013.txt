The P l a v—A M I T A K S H A R
Twishampati, the head of a struggling family of four, eking
out a hand-to-mouth existence, decides to seek a job for his
son from the local M.P., who happens to be a distant village

relation. The MP. offers a job to Twishampati himself—a
strange sort of employment. He is to pretend that in his youth

he was a revolutionary, a terrorist ﬁghting against the British
Raj. The MP. will make the necessary recommendations and
there will be no bar to Twisham’s receiving the "I'amrapatra’
and a monthly pension of Rs. 200 for having fought for
national freedom. The depressed middle class family rises to
the bait and Twisham assumes the role af an exorevolutionary.
The M. P. and his followers soon try to utilise 'I‘wishampati

for their own corrupt ends but the ‘Revolutionary’ now begins
to get stubborn. His better nature is now ﬁred by his ‘Role’, by

the revolutionary passion of the tire-independence comrades he
is supposed to have worked with. Now 'I‘wisham’s conscience

is stirred, how commitment to his pretended role grows and how
the ﬁnal release is achieved form the stuff of Amitakshar.
