2. The Group : CH ETA NA
In 1944, under the leadership of Indian People’s Theatre:
Association, a new force’began shaping the course of the drama.
movement in West Bengal.
That " force is.our background.
We are not detached from that current. But we are in.
search of new channels.
We started our work in November, 1972.
selves Chetana.

We

call

our-,-

Chetana means consciousness.

Theatre acquires a moral grandeur when it functions as.
an instrument of social change.
‘Theek Natak’, or the morally right theatre, makes men.
realise that it is possible for them to become authentically

human.
During the last 7 years Chetana has produced 6 full length.
and 2 one-act plays.

The Play: MAREECH SANGBAD
It is a time-bound and hoary tradition for the ruling class
to win over a section of the people and to keep it conte
nted as
long, of course, as it does not outlive its utility.

The urge for

freedom or the aspirations of a wholesome life of
the people
have no relevance to the ruling class.
Mareech received a fresh lease of l if'e through
the grace:
of Ravana, the King of Lanka. Therefore Mareech
had to play

a phantom deer to be killed in the service
of the selfsame‘
Ravana.
