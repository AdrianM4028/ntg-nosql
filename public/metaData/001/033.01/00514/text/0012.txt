4. The Group ; SUDRAK
Sudrak appeared on the contemporary Bengali theatre
scene not with a whimper but a bang. They compelled attention with their very ﬁrst play’Amitakshar which remains one of
the ﬁnest productions of 1978, earning ovations from all sections of the theatre-going public in and outside Calcutta.
The group was formed on October

9, 1977 and it had

only seven members to start with. All of them were very young

at the time.
Amitakshar
has run to packed hoyses scores of
times in the leading theatre houses of Calcutta and in several
districts of West Bengal, as also in Delhi two years ago.

The membership strength of the team has grown from
seven to ﬁfteen and they have grown in conﬁdence as well.
Their next venture was Samabartan which opened in Calcutta …
only recently—on September 19, 1980.
