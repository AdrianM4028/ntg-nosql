1. The Group : THEATRE WORKSHOP
Theatre Workshop was founded in 1966 by a group

states and cities in India including Delhi and has also attended”
a theatre festival at Dacca. Theatre Workshop has to its credit
18 productions (9 full-length plays and 9 oneoact) produced ’

over a span of 14 years.

These productions include plays by

bite. They are poor, landless destitutes and their traditional
business is on the wane. The acting time and the actual timeare identical in this play as things occur one chaitra afternoon

and the tension grows alongwith an advancing storm which...
