1 3 'Scene 2 : The Belgachia Theatre, where

Michael’s farce Burd-

Shaliker Ghare Ron (“ l‘he Silvered Rake”) is in

rehearsal. Michael is directing Keshub in the role of
the licentious lord, but when he makes the peasant
kick the lord, there is an uproar. The leaders of
Hindu society protest so effectively that the patrons , ,

of the theatre hastily cancel the scheduled premiere
of Michael’s farce.

Scene 3 : The

chamber

of Sir

Mordaunt Wells, Justice of"

Calcutta High Court, where a conference is being;

Michael M.S, Dutt, published in the journal “Citi- ,

zen . Vidyasagar, perhaps the greatest reformer this
country has produced, is summoned to help in the ३"
investigations but, characteristically, he makes it an .

issue of honour and refuses to help.
Scene 4 : Michael’s home at No. 6, Lower Chitpur Road. We "

he married and cruelly abandoned in Madras, visits .l
him in his nightmare and accuses him of des er ticn.
Scene 5 : A women’s Jarra performance of the time about the

iniquities of indigo planters in Bengal shows the impact of Michael’s new, vigorous verse on the common
people. They seem to have at last found a language
suitable for the expression of anger.
composes Meghnad his magnum opus,
speciﬁcally the scene of Meghnad’s cowardly assassination by Lakshman. In Michael’s f'evered imagination, the war in Lanka assumes contemporary signiﬁcance.
