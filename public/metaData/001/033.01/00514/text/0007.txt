The legend of Mareech is being relived again and again
all over the world. For example, Gregory of America and
Iswar of Bengal. Gregory has to choose the way of selfannihilatiOn to escape becoming a part of the American drama

in Vietnam.

Iswar is expected to betray his class because his

father and he are beholden to the landlord. Iswar, however,
ﬁghts back and recovers his class instinct.
The Magician is playing his tricks, assembling characters
from the legend and from history. In this game, pivoting round
the story of Mareechh, it is fore-doomed that all

Mareechs

will be destroyed.
But Iswar revolts.

So also Gregory.

Even

Mareechh

'f'ollows suit. The present is altering not only the future but also

the past. The Magician is bewildered. This is a crisis situation
beyond his control.

He has to invoke the sage Valmiki, Who

ﬁrst recorded the subjugation of Mareech.
approves of the alterability of the myth.
