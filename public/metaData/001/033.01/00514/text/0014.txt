"The Play : Daroa Pathikbar ‘
(STAY, PASSERBY)
The play deals with the most creative period in the life of
Michael Madhusudan Dutt,

poet and lifelong rebel—namely 1859 to 1861.
There have been several plays in Bengali about this man,
and a new one would not have been necessary, were it not for

the fact that Michael has consistently been potrayed at best as
a cry—baby, and, at worst, as a man ashamed of his own break

with the religion of his ancestors. We oifer a diﬁerent reading.
The title of the play is from Michael’s self-composed epitaph.
fScene 1 : Street in Calcutta before the famous Belgachia Theatre, where Michael’s play

Sermistha, is in perform-

ance. A ramshackle band of women singers, who
dance and act in the villages, has arrived in the city
to try for a night’s stand at the theatre, but is rudely

told that
aifair and
required.
Michael’s

the theatre is a civilized, Europeanized
cheap minstrels from the village are not
But the echoes of a patriotic song from
play move the women. When the play

ends, three gentlemen invade the scene—a Brahmin

and bourgeois gentil hamme, both scandalized by
Michael’s play, and Keshab Ganguly, the famous

actor, creator of most of Michael’s heavy parts. The
two pillars of society force the actor to repeat a
particularly outrageous scene
from Sermistha
which leads almost to a riot.
