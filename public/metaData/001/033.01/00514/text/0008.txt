3. The Group : NAN DI KAR
Nandikar was founded in 1960 with two objectives : per-s:
forming

good

plays

with

reﬁned

methods

and

with‘

scrupulous adherence to a strict code of ethics ;.. and ma kingf

its work socially meangingful.
In the eighteen years of its existence about forty plays
have been produced. Nandikar has undoubtedly been one of
the busiest non-commercial theatre troupes in India having per»

formed nearly 3000 times till now. Needless to say these produc»
tions have been immensely successful and have not only ﬁred

the imagination of the theatre-goers of Calcutta but have also
evoked interest amongst audiences in other states as well.

Nandikar has an all-India repute, having performed in
important cities like Bombay, Delhi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Bhilai, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Patna and so forth.

One of its ex~directors received the Sangeet Natak Akademy award for direction. Its present director, Shri Rudraprasad
Sengupta, a playwright and famous stage actor, has been selec»
ted a member of the Academic Council of the National School—

of Drama and is the recipient of this year’s Sangeet Natak
Akademy award for direction.
Nandikar is not just a theatre organisaticn devoted to aesthetics and thefpractice of theatre. Nandikar is by and large at
youth organiSation imbued with a strong sense of social respon-r-

sibility.
