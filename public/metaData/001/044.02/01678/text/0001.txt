The Urubhangam is a particular hind of one
act play, Called the
Utsristikankay which CCﬂCEfL’ mah.r actin

Taking this homeuwork Bhasa builds a power
ful one act play divided
into the presentation of warmawesome9 regre
tful, lapsing into terrible
silence.
The villain Of the epic becomes the true end—
of a sharp
suggestive landscape of violece, cunning survi
val~a horizon of change.
The touch or sparsha of Krishna, avatar of Vishn
u the Preserver»
subtly invoked—seeks out its disreputable
favourite Duryodhana, and
claims his SOul.

What we can understand is that war is alway
s an impulsive and
immediate concern bdfthat evolution waits
upon change. Natural
goodness is ignored, the awake emerged man-h
owever ignoble, ignorant—
is chosen and illumminéd. It is.therefore a
play of war and peace.

In fact this production is a thrilling experience to
me.
As a
theatre student and as a theatre worker we have to know
what our
traditions are.
- Ashim Kumar Bose.

This production was a unique experience.
A traditional classical
form of fighting like ’KALARI' seems to us of immense use.
We realise
during the training of KALARI that how
our Indian Theatre is loosing

so much.due to undue influence of western techniques.

We are not presenting the whole play and it is also our first
experience with a movement oriented production, choreographed

stylistically involving Kalari and Kathakali Mudras, which are mostly
similar to Bharata's Natya Shastra.
Poetry or Kavya and Music both
enter into the interpretation of the KARUNA—RASA
