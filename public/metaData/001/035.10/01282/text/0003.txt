गाइ in Indian Dance

KHOL DC)
by Maya Krishna Rao
Saadat Hasan Manto’s famous short—story ‘Khol Do’ (‘The Return’) — a heart

rending search of a father for his daughter when times have gone berserk
— is reinterpreted in this dance—theatre experiment. The inspiration and

energy come from Kathal<al i .

“ In creating this piece l was strongly tugged by the idea that a father can
become his daughter, so deep is his anguish. He finds her in himself, he
finds her in dance ..... Single actions may have no particular meaning but
it is resonances which create multiple meanings.” (Maya)

Maya trained in Kathal<ali under Guru Madhava Panikkar and later Sadanarn

Balakrishnan. An MA. in Theatre and Dramatic Arts, she is on the visiting
faculty of the National School of Drama. She continues to perform

Kathal<a|i, her specialisation being the male role.
