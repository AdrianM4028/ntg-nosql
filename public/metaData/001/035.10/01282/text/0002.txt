YAGNA
By Daksha Sheth and Dev/ssaro

Centering on the theme of “Fire", Yagna touches on the practical, ritual
and philosophic significance of fire in vedic culture, and broadly mirrors
the structure of the vedic fire sacrifice or Yagna. The first section
“Elements of the Sacrifice” is an exploration of ritual space, ritual speech
and ritual actions. The second is the invocation of the gods. In the third
section “Ahuti” or oblation, by symbolically offering various substances

into the fire, the sacrificer is offering himself as the sacrifice. Thus fire and
water become a potent symbol of the cycle of life.
Daksha Sheth , dancer and choreographer, is a leading figure in the
new generation of Indian dancers. Her innovative choreographies seek to
find a powerful, contemporary yet uniquely Indian idiom of dance

expression beyond the boundaries of any traditional from .
Devissaro has collaborated with Daksha in her experiments in dance as
both music and artistic director. In 1989, they founded AARTI, the
Academy for Arts Research, Training and Innovation in dance. They are
presently based in Trivandrum, Kerala.
