I remember sharing these questions with a friend, Siddhartha Gautam, who grieved
deeply about the constraints on our freedom in India. It was one of the last things that I
shared with him because his death occurred suddenly, two weeks later. If this production
is dedicated to him, it is not to fetishize his memory, but to acknowledge an agenda of
political action to which he was committed that remains open. | am deeply grateful to all
the supporters of this production, and most of all to my actors, who have helped me in
very concrete ways to confront this agenda and make me realize how we can begin, like
Molina and Valentin, to meet through differences.
