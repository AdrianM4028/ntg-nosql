ON SPEAKING THE SENTENCES
And l so arranged the sentences that their effects
Became visible, 1 mean in such a way that
The fact of speaking them could
Make the speaker happy, or unhappy, and we others too
Could be made unhappy, or happy, by hearing him speak..thus.
(Hence the plays became harder to see: the ﬁrst

lrnpression often sank in only when they were seen the second time.)
THE MOMENT BEFORE IMPACT

l speak my lines before
The audience hears them; what they will hear is
Something done with. Every word that leaves the lip
Describes an arc, and then
Falls on the listener’s ear; I wait and hear
The way it strikes; 1 know

A.

We are not feeling the same thing and
We are not feeling it at the same time.
THE PLAY IS OVER
The play is over. The performancecommitted. Slowly

The theatre, a sagging intestine, empties. In the dressing rooms
The nimble salesmen of hotchpotch mimicry, of rancid rhetoric

Wash off mak-up and sweat. At last
The lights go down which showed up the miserable
Botched job; twilight falls on the
Lovely. nothingness of the misused stage. In the empty
Still mildly smelly auditorium sits the honest“

Playwright, unappeased, and does his best
To remember.

—Bertolt Brecht
