About the Play.....

This story is about the Them who are never
considered human by the humans community
itself. They are always surrounded by a sea of
questions like Who they are ......... है What they
are ...... है Why they are...... हैं How they are ....... हैं From
when they are...... etc. Nobody has ever tried to
answer these questions. Either They are chased
away, negated or ridiculed and even scared of by
the rest of the society; ‘
This is a small attempt to see them at close
quaters, to go deep in their lives, to feel their pain
and sorrows and to explore the many hidden layers

of their conscience and existance.
