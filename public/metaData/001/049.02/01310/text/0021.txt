From an interview of Dr. Dharmveer Bharti taken by Dr. Prabhakar Kshotriya

In our Indian philosophy there was a

word, a bit different from progress completeness or fulfilment, and for this
the most crucial thing was said to be self
realisation. The question which c0nfronted me was: While living in this
incomplete world, participating in half
hearted struggles, falling prey to the
pseudo illusions could I achieve comple-

tion or fulfilment of myself . . . those
values which inspired this search, those
values which in this era itself, and
prevailing situations helped achieving
self realisation. And completion or
fulfilment were true human values. For
me war, war-conciousness, history,
sense of history, fate, and nature of fateafter searching all these, after passing
through all of these, does a person feel a
kind of scarcity in heart or it is thirst
which fulfils it? Radha asked this ques-

tion. When I had finished writing
’Andhayug’ Radha asked me - ”yes! So
much has happened, such a great history
was made . . . l have no place in it. If I
had no importance then did Kristian tell
a lie when he told me that - you are
everything to me. You embody all that is
mine, all my truth, chi ldhood?” - l was
under obligation to answer to the reader.

All that great image of Radha’s great love
and her dedication and its deepest
possible meanings and also the whole
universal creation, procreation and the
beauty of the creation and its flowering,
and the process of evolution — and all of
these, has been syrnbolised in her love.

For that love Radha calls upon him and
simultaneously assures him that on every
turn of history ’She will stay with Kanu',
will be co partner of Kanu'. This old
Radha is the Radha of modern times who
has love, dedication and new promise
too. ’I am here Kanu. so that while
making history, you are not left alone.’
