who revives Rama and brings him back to life. Bhavabhuti treats his devine characters as mortals,

as great human beings. They do not resort to magic to go through their mortal life. It is the utter
helplessness of their personal life, that makes these characters so dear to the masses.
I had done this production once before, in 1991. That was the time, when a political party had

used - rather misused, Rama's image to come to power. In order to suit their political compulsions
they had made Rama into a lonely ﬁgure; an angry young man ﬁghting for his land. But Rama is a
family man. Rama's image is incomplete without Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman. He never fought
a war for the sake of, either power or for land.
Even when he fought a war, it was against power, or rather the misuse of it. Rama's companion in
the war against Ravana is nature and his soldiers; the monkies, the bear, the squirrel and an eagle.

The war in Ramayana is a metaphorical war. I am doing this production again now. And this time
my focus is entirely on Rama's family life. Uttam Ramar/Jarit/a raises profound questions about
marriage, morality and love. I have tried to understand these issues through Uz‘z‘am Ramac/mrit/y.
We are dedicating this production to the memory of Late Sh. Mohan Upreti. He had composed
the music for the play in 1991 . He was a great composer and a far greater human being. I must also
mention here the extraordinary strength of Sathyanarayan KaVi Ratna's Hindi translation. We are
publishing a note written by Ravindra Tripathi, on Kaviratna in the brochure. I must thank three
other friends of mine Shri Shekhar, of Meta-phor, Bangalore, Madhusudan the artist,

filmmaker from Delhi and Sh. K. S. Rajenderan, the classical drama professor at NSD for their
timely help.
