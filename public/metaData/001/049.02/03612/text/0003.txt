ABOUT T H E P LAY
Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Was first performed in New York City on 1962. The play stunned and pleased
American audiences, seemed to provide a vital insight into American life. The country was coming out of the
19505, when Dwight “like” Eisenhower was a conservative, well—loved president and television shows like leave

it to Beaver and father knows best were popular. The importance of a happy family was emphasized by both
politicians and popular culture. Many Americans considered success to be measured by having one’s own house,
car, kids and dog. By all shallow measures, the 19505 were a stable, productive time for the United States of
America. And yet, these shallow measures and the trappings of success often his real problems, which will
eventually crop up in any human community. It is this raw, human truth beneath the phony exterior threat

Edward Albee attempts to reveal in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
The title comes from rewriting the words to the children’s song, “Who’s afraid of the big had woolf?” It comes

us as a joke at Martha’s father’s party. The song is significant because it ties together the themes of childhood
and parenthood, reality versus fantasy, and career success. The couples in this ———oay do not have any children
and remain tied to their parents. Martha and George rely on Martha’s father for his position and his paycheck.
Honey and Nick rely upon Honey’s father for the money that he left them. This song, bastardized from a
children’s ditty, shows how all four characters in the play still function more as children than they do as adults.
The fact that the name is changed to “Virginia Woolf” is also significant. In her writing, Virginia Woolf
atternped to reveal the truth of human experience, emotion, and thought: all of the things that the couples in
this play try to cover up.
