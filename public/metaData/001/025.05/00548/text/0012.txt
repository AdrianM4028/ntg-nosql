Bhonl, staged in Delhi in the
year 1950, a quarter century has
slipped away without giving us
even as many good plays as
would help us know what the
Garhwali theatre is. Is it a
Ramlila theatre or a theatre of
Variety Shows? Is the Garhwali
drama somewhere between the
two or has it established its
own identity ? These are difﬁcult questions to answer at least
at present. The pace of development of the Garhwali drama
is so slow that it remains on the
whole in its infancy even today.
Excepting for a few good plays,
most of them have either come
out of a ‘teacher’s’ pen or lack
the qualities of a modern
drama. If at all it should be

called a drama, it should have

at least been freed from the

clutches of a patternistic story.
Drama is certainly a different
mode of writing, clearly distinct
from a poem, an epic, a novel
or a story. Drama, in fact, is a
piece ofcommunication art. If
we put the question : ‘what
does the Garhwali theatre, in
whatever from it may be,

eager to have some good entertainment, but unfortunately

communicate to the audience ?,

most of the plays are devoid of

unfortunately, our reply will
necessarily be: ‘a teaching light humour - a little suspense
or gallantry’. This is the
position with our theatre in
general. There is no dearth of
Garhwali spectators in Delhi.
Even mediocre plays run to
house-ful shows.
People are

this quality. Though entertainment should not be the sole
objective of a drama, it should
at least provide that, if nothing
else. The current decade, however, gives some signs of hope
for the Garhwali theatre. For instance, Lalit Mohan Thapaliyal
comes with a pleasing form of

Badola improves the techniques
of production in Chatti KI Ek

But it is Rajendra
Dhasmana
who takes the
Garhwali drama many steps
ahead by refusing to be a conf'ormist to old forms and
contents. His full length play
Jank Jorh, if I may say so, can

be called the turning point in

the history of Garhwali drama.
