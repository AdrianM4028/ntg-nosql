In the ﬁfties a new generation of playwrights, directors,
actors and technicians started
emerging in the Marathi theatre.
Their struggles were partially
helped by the annual drama
competition organized by the
State Government. This event
originated in bilingual Bombay
but . had its. full ﬂowering in
Maharashtra. Every year the
competition encourages a spate

of playwriting all over the
State, and steadily over the
past. two decades playwrights
and artistes of merit who make
their debut. in it take a step in
the direction of the professional
theatre.

Indeed, one indication of the
vitality of the modern Marathi
theatre is that the old distinction
between professional and amateur no longer holds good. To
give an example, best known
outside Maharashtra, the playwright Vijay Tendulkar made
his beginnings by writing for
amateur groups. There was
time when his plays could not
be staged for more than a few
performances and, as such,
lacked professional status. But
this is no longer true of such
recent plays of his as S/zamata
Court C/zalu Kin/2?, Sakharam Binder
and Gharhimm Kolwal.
V

Tendulkar is, again, a representative example of a writer
who delved deep into the
Maharashtrian reality of the
post-war years which Marathi
ﬁction had portrayed so convincingly and in such inﬁnite
variety. The “little man” of his

early plays—which were totally
devoid of the morbidity of
Sakharam Binder or Gidhade—is a
product of the Maharashtrian
middle classes of our day and
projects the pathos of their
lives.
In later years, Tendulkar
widened his compass so that in
a play like Gharhimm he hits at
the Brahmin orthodoxy of
Peshwa-age Poona only to
suggest the claustrophobic conformism of our own times.
While Ghashz'ram has created
a revolution in theatre form,
the one thespian who has made
a distinctive contribution in
this ﬁeld is the humorist P. L. v
Deshpande.
His
satirical
comedy 'I'uja .4ahe Tujapashi is
miraculously contemporary in
feeling posting as it does the
austere philosophy of a pseudoGandhian aeharya with the
epicurean ways of a charming
old man steeped in the more
ingratiating feudal values.
Deshpande went on to develop one-man shows and revues
in both of which his own scintillating wit served to produce
an unconventional but hilariously funny theatre-experience.

In the early years of the
Marathi theatre, the mythological play offered unambiguous
contemporary references. K. P.
Khadilkar’s Keechakwaa'lz was
actually banned by the British
Government under the assumption that the villain Keechak

allegorically portrayed Curzon,
the then Viceroy.
