The Samaj got another lease of life under the presidentship of Shri
U. S. Rawat who very ably
managed its activities. He had been instrumental in creating favourab
le atmosphere for merger of
Sangeet Natak Samaj, Parvatiya Patrakar Mandal and
Garhwal Sahitya Mandal which was formalized
on May 12. 1965. The new body thus formed after the merger
was named Garhwal Sahitya Kala Samaj
and had on its roll some new faces, namely. Sarvash
ri Virendra Mohan Ratoori, Rajendra Singh
Rawat, G. P. Thapaliyal ‘Kankal’, Rajendra Dhasrnana
and Satish Jugran. The Samaj became very
active during this period and staged many new one-act
plays such as Ek Jaw Agnai, In bhi Cha/da,
Doono Jana/n, etc. Previously Shri Lalit Mohan
Thapaliyal's four one-act plays were the only plays
with

the Samaj.

Shri Urned Singh Rawat had to pay attention to Garhwa
l Hiteshini when he became its

president and the Samaj for some time lost an
enthusiastic president till Sarvashri Ram Prasa

Yadunandan Prasad Dangwal. Sudama Prasa
d Mamgain and Chandra Ballabh Kukreti came
to its

rescue.

Later Shri U. S. Rawat also had to leave Delhi on transf
er of service.

Sarvashri Ram Prasad Nautiyal, Moha
n Chandra Dandriyal, Chandra Mohan
Kabadiyal, Bihari Lal

Nautiyal, Kanta Prasad Thapaliyal and Satya
Prakash Hindwan had already been there
since Shri U. S.
Rawat's time. The Samaj again
became very active. Now that Sarv
ashri Mitra Nand Maithani,
M. L. Dabral, B. B. Dabral, etc. have also
joined the Samaj, its activities on
the stage have again been
enhanced.
