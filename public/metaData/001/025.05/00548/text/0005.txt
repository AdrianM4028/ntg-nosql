A collection of five one-act plays by Lalit Mohan Thapaliyal entitled
‘Khadu Lapata ar Anya Natak' has also been published by the Samaj .

Some other books are ready for publication.
It is in compliance with our annual commitment that we are now coming
forward with a Garhwali play ' Arddha—Grameshwar' written by
Raj endra Dhasmana .

Last year we had staged Dhasmana ' s ' Jank Jorh'

which in fact started the real making of the Garhwali theatre.

‘Arddha—

Grameshwar' is another masterpiece of the playwright and we hope it
should immensely contribute towards further growth of the Garhwali
theatre.

This year we are reproducing in our Souvenir some articles on the
theatre written by eminent drama critiques and experts in the field.
This would facilitate the readers to go through the development of
different language theatres at a glance.

We had an ambitious plan to

include many other articles also but had to be satisfied with what you
find on the following pages.

We are thankful to you all who by your kind presence have made this
occasion a success. Our gratitude is due to our advertisers, without
whose co-operation and assistance the present show could not have been
organized. We are thankful to Shri Chandrika Upadhyaya, President,
Bharat Sevak Samaj , Naoroji Nagar branch, who very kindly lent us the
B . S . S . Cottage for purposes of rehearsals and meetings.

For its proper functioning, the Samaj is always in need of help and
co—operation from you all.

Thanks.
