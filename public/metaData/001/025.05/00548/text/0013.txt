There are not many groups
of Garhwalis in the capital
which attach importance to
staging of
drama.
With
most of them, drama is a side

activity. There is no workshop
on the. drama. Many societies
are formed with the loud objectives of reforming (‘2) and
educating (1’) the community.
They sometimes oblige amateurs
to present some drama in order

to attract large number of persons at their annual functions.
At these functions more importance is given not to the drama
but to the reception and garlanding of the VlPs "and to their
irrelevant insipid speeches. The
spectators are penalized for the

only crime ; _' of

their Coming

over there with the hope of
seeing a good drama.
Some of the plays staged by
some associations/groups in
Delhi may be mentioned here.
Buddhi Ballabh Bahuguna’s
Pakha Ghaseri and Danda ki
Ayer were staged in the early
sixties, Parvatiya Yuwak Manch
staged Sudama Prasad Premi’s
Kanya Dan in

I972.

Garhwal

Pragati Mandal staged Chinta
Mani Barthwal's T/nchri in 1974.
Puspanjali Rangashala produced
Dinesh Pahari‘s Zunkhya/i Rat
in 1970 and Parashar Gaur’s
Aunsi HR?! (1969, 1970),Gawai
(1973) and Cholhi(1972). The
last mentioned was staged again
in 1975 but the VIP-worship
and the boastful claims of the
Association’s
achievements
practically marred the drama.
Ma/hu Saukar and

Kakhi Nak

Na Kakhi Soonu Na had also
been staged in the year 1973
by ' a

little

known

group.

Though these plays ventured to
display the different shades of
the hill people they could not
leave a lasting impression on
the spectators because of their
loosely knit plot and lack of
essential prerequisites of a
drama. However it was a sizeable addition to the list of
Garhwali plays staged in Delhi.
But none of them is comparable
to V. M. Badola’s production
Chhatti k/ Ek Raat (translation)
presented by Himalaya Kala
Sangam in 1970.

Contribution

of

Garhwal

Sahitya Kala Samaj

Garhwal Sahitya Kala Samaj,
more or less, a representative
body of the Garhwali stage in
the capital has been doing
pioneering work in the direction
ofmaking the Garhwali theatre.
During the last two decades the
drama group of the Samaj
staged Garhwali plays not less
than twenty times in Delhi and
outside. Lalit Mohan Thapaliyal’s one-a ct plays, namely, Ghar
Jawain, Khadu Lapata, A/‘hhary-

un k0 Ta/ and Ek/‘karan have been
staged by the Samaj quite of'—
ten during the last decade. The
staging of G. P. Thapaliyal’s

one-act play In bhiCha/da (1966)
and Virendra Mohan Ratoori’s
one-act play

Ek

Jaw

Agnai

(1966) had been appreciated by
the spectators, but the productions could not be repeated for
various
reasons.
Kishore
Ghildiyal’s three one-act plays
Rag Thag (1975), 000/70 Jana/n
(1966, 1971) and KeerukiBwai
(1971) are among the other
plays staged by the Seimaj. In
1975 the Samaj made history by
