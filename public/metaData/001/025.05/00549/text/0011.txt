The dawnstar shines, and sunshine in the dusk,

The life within the woman who gives birth,
Here, where the lovely forests shade the earth.

0 Goddess Jwalpa, find me my own mate !

Own Goddess of my fathers, turn to me!
I come in pilgrimage, accept from me
The offerings I bring ! On you I wait
To find the only one that there can be.

l bow to you with folded hands, 0 Master!
I bow to Hari who the universe created.
I bow to Parvati, the Daughter of the Himalaya,
My reverence to Goraknath. the Guru,

\

l fold my hands before the Jagat-Gurus,
Give me my own world, Master !
Give me my sun and moon , give me my wind and water,
Give me, Lord. the compassion of the creator !_

O God, guard the well being of this house,
0 God, guard the good fortune of this house,

Give happiness within, and may the flame
Of this hearth Ô¨Åre ever burn, give name
And fame, O God, and violets in its hills.
And prim roses forever in its vales.
