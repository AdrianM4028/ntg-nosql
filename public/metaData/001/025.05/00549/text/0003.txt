these objectives and achieve a breakthrough in the cultural life of our hill people
living in the metropolis. With very meagre resources at hand, the Same] has
convened in the past no fewer than fifteen literary sittings to discuss the trends in
contemporary Hindi and-Garhwali literature, forty-eight musical sittings, more than
twenty children sports days, besides some seminars, get-togethers. picnics,
illustrated talks and film-shows of educative value. In 1966, the Samaj made a
donation of Rs. 500 to Garhwal Hiteshin i Sabha for the construction of Garhwal
Bhavan in Delhi. This year, though the exact amount is yet to be decided upon,
the Same] intends to donate a considerable sum to Chaundkot Seva Sangh for
building a Degree College at Chaubattakhal, Chaundkot, Garhwal.
