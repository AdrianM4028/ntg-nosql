How lovely, love, the grasslands are below!
And though the stars should leave the sky, I swear
Our love, my starling, will forever grow,
And I will never leave you, though the pines
Turn peach trees and the mountains turn to plains.
I long for love, my life, sit with me here !
The water from the rice ﬁelds flows away

But from a single breach, and love would go
If we let jealous tongues among us stay.

“Our love began in childhood, 0 my own,
Between us. like a snake, this river came.
l will behead the snake! You are my ﬂame,

And I your lamp.”

“0, no! A lamp will burn,

And ﬁnished is the oil !" “My love, then be
A beetle, I will be a rose in bud."
"0, no. a rosebud withers and will die I"

“Then, 0 beloved, I will be the sun,

And you will be the blue and cloudlesssky."
“But never from a cloudless sky comes rain !"
“Then I the lightning, you the thunder cloud,
The dancing girl of Indra you will be!

Where there is heart, what matters death?

The ﬂower

Will bloom and die, its perfume be no more.
But life. through all defeats, will hope sustain.

Where you shall be tomorrow, who can know,

And braldlng the long braids of your dark hair?

For me, who leave you here today, is pain,
For far, 0 my beloved, I must go !"
