The main contribution of the Garhwal Sahitya Kala Samaj has been in the ﬁeld of
drama. So far it has organized ten Garhwali, four children and two Hindi drama
festivals in the capital. The drama group of the Samaj staged its plays on invitation
from outside Delhi also, viz., Meerut (twice) , Jaipur and Pauri,

Garhwal.

The

playwrights whose works have so far been staged by the Samaj include
Sarvashri J. C. Mathur, Ramesh Mehta, Laiit Mohan Thapaliyal, Kankal. Virendra
Mohan Ratoori, Ram Prasad Nautiyal, Kishore Ghildiyal and Vallabh Dobhal.
A beautiful collection of ﬁve one-act plays by Shri Lalit Mohan Thapaliyal entitled
Khadu Lapata ar Anya Natak has also been published by the Samaj. Some other
books are also ready for publication but could not be published so far because of
paucity of funds.
It is in compliance with our annual commitment that. we are now coming forward
with a Garhwali play ‘Jank Jorh' written by Shri Rajendra Dhasmana. Though you
are the best judge of the merits and demerits of the play, we can certainly hope
that it will contribute towards further growth of the Garhwali theatre.
We are thankful to you all who by your kind presence have made this occasion a
success. Our gratitude is due to our advertisers . without whose cooperation and
assistance the present show could not have been organized.
For its proper functioning, the Samaj is always in need of help and co-operation
from you all.
