Now August, and the ﬁelds are green again.
September, and the thought of you, my love,
ls like the lightning ﬂashing in the night.
October, clouds have ﬁlled the world above,
The mountains in the Festival of Light,
November! and in every home the feast,
But who, without the Master, greets the guest?
December, and the mustard flowers bloom,

How blessed is she whose master is at home,
On his protection in the cold relies.
Lo, February, weddings everywhere,

The meeting time of brides with lowered eyes.
The month of March ! The circle of the year.

How blessed is my Garhwal, O my brothers,
The summits of Kailasa send the glow
Of sunrises, and Ganga, Jumna ﬂow,
The streams of milk, 0 brothers ! God and man
Are Badrinath and Kedarnath, abode
Of Gods l The charrners of the souls of men,

The Achri maidens live here in their caves,
And winter ﬂowers are here, and what is good,
The rice ﬁelds and the barley green with waves,

And here are oaks and rhododendrons, brothers,
The stairway up to paradise, 0 brothers,
And deodars and gardens, bangles ringing,

The melody of ﬂutes and waters, brothers,
And nests of ringdoves, bells and thrushes singing,

And primroses in ﬂower, skylarks, brothers,
The ﬂower of Siva's crown Garhwal adorning !

0, do you know, my brothers, Garhwal’s worth?
