The kokil in the Spring alone will sing.
My youthful youth ! Spend not what is your own
As this night spent itself before the dawn.

The month of feeling, sisters, is here,
The ecstatic month, 0 sisters, is here !
The mountains are resplendent as they burn
With rhododendron blossoms and we hear
The ringdove in the branches everywhere,
While I wait for my Master to return.
The kokil jumps from branch to branch and sings,
The ecstatic month has come, the month which brings
The letter from him in the foreign land !
O Skylark, singer, wanderer, return !
To feed you rice and milk from my own hand
Now, in the month of ecstasy, l yearn.

The month of March, 0 love, is come and gone.
The ﬁelds are ploughed. the daisies show their face,
Now April comes, and flowers in the dawn
The girls weave into garlands for the shrine.
The month of May, 0 roses, ripe the wheat !
The house rejoices with the harvest's weight.
The month of June, 0 sisters, rice is sown,
July has come, the ﬁrst month of the rain,

What woman, sisters, goes to work alone?
