Are strung like garlands, over every bud
There rules a bee! And in the moonlight sing

The ringdoves of the spring.

The grass is green,

The ﬁelds are yellow with the mustard bloom,
And l had thought my master would be home,
But I remain, remembering what has been.

The darkness of September is how deep,
Peacock, sinner, dance not here !
And from the ﬂutes of those who graze the sheep
Music wanders in the air.
The mountain echoes ripple while l weep,
Silence, buffalo, your bells l
0, what has come that can my master keep

While of tears my sari tells '?
What my heart held, within my heart remains,
How, without you, eat or drink?
The empty ponds are ﬁlling in the rains,
Overﬂow, O ponds, the brink !

How lovely are the grasslands here, 0 see!

This ﬂower has bloomed, O God, your lips to steal.
Antelbow length is what is left of day,
The sun has set, the forest has grown still,
I long for love ! My life, sit down awhile!

0, no t On these cold slopes there sleeps the snow,
Larks sing, this yoke of love i will not wear!
