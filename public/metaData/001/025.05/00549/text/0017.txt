Though not unknown to the Hindi world,
Rajendra Dhasrnana is yet to make his
mark among writers of GarhWali. Jank
Jorh is his ﬁrst play in Garhwali and it
should make a welcome addition to the
Garhwali drama. We have very few plays
for our stage. Sarvashri Bhawani Dutt

Very few yong directors of the Garhwali
plays are as enthusiastaas Mohan Dandriyal.
An active aptitude for the drama
has produced a good director and a
potential actor in him. According to him
he made his debut on the Hindi stage some
time in 1957. Since then he has regularly
been appearing before the audiencesof
both Hindi and Garhwali plays. Some of the
plays in which his actor excelled include
H/‘sab Kitab Barabar, Paisa Bo/ta Hai, Jab
Ham Na Henge, Bherh/ye, Sagaai Wale and
Gar/bi Hatao. The last play had also been
direc1ed by him in May 1972.

presentation and stagecraft.

living in Delhi.

The

author is not concerned with bringing out
the rhythms

and subtle

nuances of the

language for itself. His concern is to portray the human reality of the Garhwalis'
life in the metrOpolis. In this he has succeeded in a large measure.
He does not use a story content to support the play but attempts to hold the
