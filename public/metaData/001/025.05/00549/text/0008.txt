Visit some time these mountain grasslands,
You who are lighter than air,
You who are graceful as oats in ﬂower,

Sweet as wild strawberry, hear !
Visit some time these mountain grasslands,
Dhana, your arms are round,

You are more delicate even than water,

Sharp is your tongue, I have found l

Where has my Daunta wandered away,

Scattering lustrous looks from her dark eyes,
Dancing away when the light of the day
Flashed beyond the village across the skies?
With her sickle she plays, her waist, her grace
Are like a field of ripe oats in the wind,
lee a hanging picture is her face.
Image of me she will be in the end!
A spell of enchantrnent the whole world fills

When Daunta stands, a star above the hills.

While other ﬂowers blossom all the year,
The primrose blossoms only in the spring,
While other song birds always are here,
