What flower can this be upon your bank,
Alakananda, ﬂower strange, unique?
The forest is enchanted, and its gleam,
Of sparkling whiteness dims your shining stream I
What ﬂower can this be for me to take,
Alakananda, and my own to make?

0, ﬂowers and ﬂowers have blossomed here. but look!
For some will bloom tomorrow, some today,
And some are ﬂowers which blossomed yesterday.

The rhododendron blossoms and the oak
Have brought again the beauty of the spring,
Bright beetles on the creepers of the wood
