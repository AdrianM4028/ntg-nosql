'Friends,
Garhwal Sahitya Kala Samaj , previously known as- Garhwal
Sangeet Natak Samaj , has entered into‘ its twenty-third
year.
Since its very inception, the Samaj is wedded
to fulfilling many objectives, the chief among which is

to strengthen the theatre in all respects. Besides
staging a few Hindi plays, the Samaj has staged Garhwali
plays in the capital and outside on more than twelve
occasions.
On March 18 and 1‘5, 1976 it staged Raj endra r
Dhasmana' s ‘Arddha-Grameshwar’ in the Fine Arts Theatre,

New Delhi.

0n the pressing demand of the spectators in

Delhi, we venture to restage the play on May 30 and 31.

The entire income of the show on May 31, 1976 shall be
donated to ‘Alaknanda' , a Hindi magazine published
simultaneously from Delhi and Garhwal.

We are thankful to you all who by your kind presence
have made this occasion a success . Our gratitude is due
to our advertisers, without whose co-operation and
assistance the present show could not have been organised. Shri Chandrika Upadhyaya, president of Bharat'
Sewak Samaj , Naoroji Nagar branch, and other members

of the BSS have been very kind to us in lending us their
We
cottage at Naoroj i Nagar for rehearsal purpoSes .
daringly
should thank our female artists also who have

opened the gates for others to come forward and nourish
the theatre . Our musicians and other artistes have
co—operated with us whole heartedly and finished their

,job in record time.
