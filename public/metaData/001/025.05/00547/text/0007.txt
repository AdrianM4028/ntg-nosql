popular, was performed only before select
audiences within the palace premises. So
when Mahbub Hussain Sahab asked for
permission to perform the play in public
and received it he formed _ a company
which staged the play not only in
Lucknow, which was then the capital of
Oudh, but also in several other cities and
towns.

Others however contend that the Parsi
theatre was an outcome of industrialisation and urbanisation and that it was
primarily meant to provide entertainment

to the middle classes who were arriving
in, the cities from the villages in search of
employment. According to these sources,
the ﬁrst theatre, Hindu Dramatic Corn-

p‘any, was formed in 1849 in Grant Road,
Bombay, by English-speaking Parsis and
middle class Indians who wrote and

produced plays in Victorian style.

Their

ﬁrst production, staged on March 9, 1853,
was Raja Gopi Chander. The play, which
was about a romantic king, was produced.
in Marathi and Gujarati and later in
Hindi. j It was something like an opera

with the emphasis on dance, music and
costumes, all elements of which later

proved

very

important in the

Parsi

theatre.

While either theory may be correct, all

agree that the Parsi theatre got its name
from the Parsis and later Gujaratis, who

founded and formed the dramatic companies and that its roots were very deﬁnitely
Indian. There are however differences of
opinion about its background with some
contending that, though performed in
Hindi, it was very Gujarati, and others

expressing the view that it was a combination of the East and the West because its
plots, production and mode of acting.
. were very Victorian.
