a brief survey of garhwali theatre ‘

The First Phase:

The Garhwalis as a community have

a passion for dancing and

singing. PeOple from diﬂ'erent villages eVery so often
gather in particular spots and
just let themselves go. The abandon with which they
express themselves in its more
intense moments becomes orgiastic. Garhwal has been
a region of rich folk tradition
and had its theatre evolved in accordance
with its own genius, it would certainly
have been unrivalled. But the theatre as it has
developed in GarhWali does not seem

to have its roots in the folk forms of the land.
Garhwali theatre, such as it is, seems
to have been inspired by the Parsee theatre
as was the case with Hindi theatre,
