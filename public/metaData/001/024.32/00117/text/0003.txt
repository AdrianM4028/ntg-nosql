FEW WORDS ABOUT KOKILA NATAK MANDLi.

The only institution to teach about theatre in the country is N.S.D. This institution,
we do not want to compare with any other institution of the same kind in the world.

A few

product of institution in general and Mr. 8 Mrs. Sidhu in particular took an oath in the year
1975 that they will shed the last dr0p of their blood to promote the creative Art and Culture
of the country, which is thousand years older than any other country's Culture and Art.
Thus an organisation was formed in the name Kokila Natak Mandli. Since its inception, this
organisation have been producing plays on different mood 8 ideas of creative art; and have
staged quite a good number of plays, which have earned loud applaues both from the public and the press

All its members are either from same institution or from the professional

stage, undoubtly Kokila is not a big name in the country but their devotion is much more

than any other recognised theatre group in the whole of the country.

What so ever Kokila Natak Mandli in terms of odds 8 even, whatsoever it may be
will remain committed and devoted to the upliftment of Indian Culture 8 Art, started right
from B ha rat Mu hi to go to any extent, which no one knows.

To conclude what we seek is your guidance help and healthy criticism about the

organisation an d t h e i r activities,
