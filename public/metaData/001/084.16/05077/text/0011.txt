a Hindu girl. Mammu Haji could not tolerate the attitude
of his son and told his son to go out of the house. Veeran
invited all his relatives for the function and arranged everything but the bridegroom and his father did not turn up.
The next day he reaches the house of Mammu Haji and
abuses him in utter disgust. At that time Rahiman comes
back in a pathetic condition as his dream could not materialise and apologises for the mistakes. He expresses his
willingness to bring his wife.
