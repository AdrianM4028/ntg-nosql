The Parsi Th6atre
by BALWANT GARGI

In 1870, while Bengal was laying the foundation of its
ﬁrst professional dramatic company, some Parsi business
men became interested in the arts and the theatre, and
became the founders of the ﬁrst professional company to
use Hindustani as a language for drama.
Pestonji Framji launched the Original Theatrical Company and was soon followed, in 1877, by Khrushidji
Baliwala, who founded the Victoria Theatrical Company
in Delhi. Adventurous and ambitious, Baliwala once took
his Company to London, where it performed Hamlet.

Unaware of, the development of the theatrical arts

in

Europe, Baliwala’s company failed miserably. They had to
sell their stage equipment to return home and some players

took small jobs to pay their passage.
Among some of the famous companies that developed
a repertory of plays and a paid staff were Kavasji Khatau’s
New Alfred Theatrical Company, which continued until
the ‘twenties, the Old Parsi Theatrical Company, the

Corinthian Company, the Alexandra Company, the Prince
