TAMIL SANGAM presents

THE COMEDY OF MURDER (IN TAMIL)

_

An ailing old man has a lot of wealth but no heir
closely related, to Whom he could bequeath the same. He,
however, remembers two young men very distantly related
and invites them to come and stay with him during his

३ dying days.
The two men arrive. They are contrast to each otherone being a mod from a city and the other a simple rustic.

They are told that whoever 'showers the maximum
affection on the old man would get the wealth. This news
brings out the true mental character of the youngsters and
starts them scheming about how to offer superficial attention and affection to the old man and make him believe it to
be true. This gives rise to a load of laughter as both of
them fight to gain the old man's favour by hook or crook. In
their greed for easy money, they reveal their true colours.
This is soon followed by a plot to murder the old
man, which also turns humorous. Investigation follows the
murder by a tornfool Inspector accompanied by a harebrained Doctor.
The play ends with a note of warning on how love
of wealth can transform simple-minded people even to
murderers.
