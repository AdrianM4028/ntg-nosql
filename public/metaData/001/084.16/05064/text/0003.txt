Dear Shri Mantri,

I am glad to know that the Cultural Society of
Rajasthan is once again organising a Drama Festival of
Indian Languages in March, 1980.

I am glad to learn that the Cultural Society of
Rajasthan is organising the Xlll Drama Festival of Indian
Languages to foster and promote national and emotional
integration in the country.

The cinema has more

or less displaced the drama from national scene. Any
effort to foster and promote dramas and preserve our rich
heritage, therefore, deserves special commendation. The
drama makes much greater demand not only on the skills
of actors and actresses and the directors but also on their
forbearance. It is all the more commendable that the
Society is organising the plays in various Indian languages.
I wish the Festival all success.

I send my good wishes to the organisers on this
occasion.
Yours sincerely,

G . K. B H A N O T
