born of the same rich tradition as Bharatha Natyarn, has
its own distinctive identity and is noted for a remarkable
balance between all the three aspects of the histrionic art.
Themes such as Rama Natakarn, Rukmini Kalyanam and
Prahlada Charithram are portrayed through gesture, mime,
speech and song. The scope for variety in Abhinaya, the
comic relief provided by Vidushaka—the jester, the simple
make-up and costumes, are all special features of
