“....The house-holder goes abroad for some business
and leaves his house for his servants to take care
. The
servants Shewak Ram and Mirchumal prove to be
clever
enough to lend the same portion to two tenents, one M
iss
Meena, who” stays in the night-hours and other Mr. h
fohan
who stays in the day. Once they happen to cross
each,

other and thus the cat comes out of the bag.’
