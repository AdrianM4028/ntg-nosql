Drama Today :

SOME

THOUGHTS

Byâ€”Vijay Verma
The potentialities and the scope of drama as an artform are next only to those of the cinema. Music and
painting may get modernized in order to be better in
line with the emerging patterns of human existence and
to reflect more faithfully the contemporary mood and
mores. But, in the very nature of things, music and
painting cannot play the role of an active ingredient in
the social transformation itself which the visual arts,
particularly cinema and theatre, can and are playing.
The propensity of literature to get influenced by a given
social milieu and its capacity to influence the latter, are,
of course, more pronounced than the case is with music
and painting. But cinema and drama, projected and

Correspondingly the answerability of those active in the
fields of cinema and theatre is also greater. Similarly
the need for being able to strike instant and conternporaneous rapport with the audience is all the greater in

the case of these media.
Poetry and music, unless
sought to be projected and exploited commercially, can
be entirely for the creator's own edification and fulfilment; not so drama.

You cannot conceive a play minus

the presence of an audience beyond the footlights and
as Utpal Dutt rightly pointed out at Jaipur recently,
drama is a thing of here and now. You do not, normally,
write plays for posterity even though a later generation
may return to or find continuing validity in a dramatic
work.

At the same time, no real work of art, drama included,

can be of any worth in the absence of sincerity and
conviction on the part of its creator. Propagandist drama
