artistes from outside should not be exempt
from Entertainment Tax. Since practically all noted
artistes of classical music and dance do not make Jaipur
their home, this means that the people of Jaipur will
rarely get an opportunity to see or hear them. Certainly,
no organisation can hope to pay the fees of these
performers and also have money left over to pay the
Entertainment Tax just from the proceeds of the ticket
sales. If the organisation wants to get a top class
classical performer it must coax some rich patron to foot
the fees of the artiste. If it is the objective of the tax
authorities to boost local artistes by the above arbitrary
decision, then they are mistaken, for the Jaipur audience

the organisers. In one instance, at a Folk Dance

gave notice to the organisers under the above law.
Fortunately, since there was no theatre involved and
there were no tickets for the performance, the organisers
were not liable under the law.
To give an idea of the financial difficulties of organisers
the following calculations may be perused. The capacity

of the Rabindra Manch is 775 seats.

Even if there is a

house full performance, the total income at the low
admission rates of Rs. 3, 2 and 1, for 200 seats, 300

seats and 250 seats respectively, comes to Rs. 1 4501-.
For a house full performance, a top artiste is needed in
the classical music or dance field, which means expenses
nothing less than Rs. 1000. To meet the deficit, either

a donor has to be found or the ticket rates have to be
steeply enchanced. But once the ticket rates go up above
Rs. 3/-, the Entertainment Tax rate mounts to 70%,
which leaves the organiser deeply in the red. Even a

of about

Rs. 2,000/- on the production of a play with the barest

of props and costumes. How can it afford to stage the
play if the tax people demand their cut. Repeat performances may help but the lack of public enthusiasm forr
the theatre limits the number of repetitions to a mere
dozen at the maximum. The normal number of repeti—
