Play : Bawa Jitto

The play “Bawa Jitto" is inspired from the folk narrative of the same name sung
in 'KARKAN‘ style in the hilly regions of Jammu Province. The production uses the
element of Karkan है Bakhan and other minor performance modes of the region. The
performers of the play have been working in all these regional performing styles and
adapting them in their own way. In this process a new acting methodology is being
evolved by training of the urban actors in traditional performances. The traditional
performing styles are not being imitated by our actors, but we are trying to get the
best of their training process through their vocal and physical exercises.
lrnaginative visuals have been created by grouping and re—grouping of the actors
with the aim to speak to the audience across language barriers. The resources of
the actors energy has been used to the maximum by creating effective visual images
to make this production more effective and communicable.
