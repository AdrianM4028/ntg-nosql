All plays are not NA'I‘AKAS

English language gives us
the
meaning (of the word Play as a Drama
or vice versa.

In Indian standards, a play or
drama does not directly mean only a
Nataka but a Drusyakavya or Rupaka.
Now a days it is found that only the
word Nataka is very widely being
utilised to denote any stage play or
any dramatic literature, through out
India.
We know that the word Nataka,
happens to be just “One” amongst
many other terminologies used and
available in our Indian treatise on
dramaturgy, each denoting a “Kind '

of drama” or Rupaka.
Bharata
gives us

What are these so many names for ?
Did the past masters created these
names out of fun ? These forms
definitely differ from one another
what ever their dillerences may be.
They speak for themselves the great—

ness of our culture. They speak about
a heritage called

In Sahitya Darpana, Biswanaih
Kaviraj describes 18 kinds of dramas
as Uparupakas,

call every work a “Nataka” १ Are all
these words useless, except one word
Nata ka 1? Have we ever tried to understand them and having understood we
have discarded them or with the
impact of the inflows we are forced
to forget our traditional culture. We
are surely trsying to take an easy
mode, thereby creating unhealthy

precedent for the future.
In fact, when a civilisation progresses or marches ahead, research
increaser and everysthing turns more

specific, more tecnnical, more detailed.

By calling every king of play a

Nataka, are we marching

ahead ?
