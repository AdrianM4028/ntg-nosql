In view of conditions
in this town
This is how I act:

When I enter I give
my name and show
Papers which prove It
by stamps that
Cannot be forged

When I say anything I cite
witnesses of whose credibility

l have pioofs.
When I say nothing
I give my face

ï¬‚n expression of vacuity
so it can be seen that

I am not thinking
Thus

I allow no one to believe me.
an forms of trust
I reject
I do this because I know:
Conditions in this town

Make belief impossible.
