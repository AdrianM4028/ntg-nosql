HOLI is a gory celebration of life. A segment
. of the present [from where the future appears
blurred and desolate, sees the marrow as a
scary apparition and tries to deﬁne itself

within the confines of a college group.
The tragic comedy envelopes the entire
generation of young adults studying courses
for which they have no use in their future
professions. As a n indictment of the situation

where life borders on hallucinations, where
the path search is peppered with sardonic
smiles and deathly indifferent gaze of an

older generation which will not budge, “HOU”
is an updated diary, which catalogues every
happemng.

It is a story of a confused and choked generation, which finds itself trapped, hurt and

angry.
