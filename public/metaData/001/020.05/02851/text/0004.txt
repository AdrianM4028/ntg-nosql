RAKT-KALYAN Written in 1989 in the backdrop of Marrdeandal conflict,

the drama draws parallel between the SocioReligious, Political and Economic
conditions of existing times and southern India in 12 century AD. during

Bhakti Movement.
Eight hundred years ago, in the city of Kalyan, a man called Basavanna
assembled a congregation of poets, mystics, social revolutionaries and
philosophers, unmatched for their creativity and social commitment in the
history of Karnataka, even perhaps of India itself. They opposed idolatry,
rejected temple worship, upheld the equality of the sexes and condemned
the caste system. But events took a violent turn when they acted on their
beliefs and a brahmin girl married a ‘low-caste' boy. The movement ended in
bloodshed. Rakt-Kalyan (Tale-danda) deals with the few weeks during which
a vibrant, prosperous society plunged into anarchy and terror.
