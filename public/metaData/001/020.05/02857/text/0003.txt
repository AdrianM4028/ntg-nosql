The play has conceited logics of Metaphysical poets
and also sometimes the absurdity of "Waiting for godot” by
Samuel Beckett and philosophy of Freud as well, in terms of
Caligula’s relationship with his sister.

The play runs in 4 acts. There are various psychological strains of the character studied through the mouth piece of
Helicon his friend, Caesonia his lover, Cherea his Iiteratteures
friend, Scipion the young poet friend of him and various
courtiers.

The tension of Caligula appears to be very universal

for the searching temperament of any era.

That is why the

theme of the play sometimes sounds very contemporary.

Caligula wants to end the miseries of life by winning
over death.
He does not like Iiteratteures because they
He punishes courtiers because he
exaggerate the truth.
thinks that to rule is to loot and it is not a crime if tax collectors
are taxed. He feels that money is more important than love and
affection. Camus' old courtier is equally philosophical when
he gives an all time relevant comment-one man and post, the
system should be as such.

Camus addresses through Caligula in the Jargon of modern
poetry, where images are so interwoven that they appear
to be complexed and complicated, which on recital takes you to
the deep interpretation, rather to more grotesque heartfelt images
but appearing to be at a times crystal clear. Caligula’s logics
may appear to be illogical. You may not at times accept

Caligula’s or Camus' theory but you do agree with them at
certain points as well.

Life is for exploring, that is the process of evolution as

well.

If this process stops, life tends to become a wastefui

adventure !!
