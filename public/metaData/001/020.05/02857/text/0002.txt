tumultuous backdrop of Ilnd World War in 1939 when there
was war misery, treachery and death allaround.

The play deals with the metaphysical realities of life
through the protaganist Caligula, The play was first time
staged in 1945. It proved to be a major success.
The action in the play starts in'the first year of the rule

of Caligula. 'camus’ Caligula is an historical Roman ruler who
belonged to the famous clan of Caesers. But he has given new
dimensions to this character by using the biographical details
about Caligula for his own voyage through the intricasies of
life.

Caligula has gone in hybernation after the sudden
demise of his sister and pararnour Drussila. His courtiers.
friends and subjects are woried about his conspicuous absence
from his palace. Some of them start compaigning

against his

rule. Caligula returns after three days but as a changed person;
sounding idiosyncratic, eccentric Er appearing to have lost his
mental balance. Butthe truth is different. He has realised
about the shaking loyalities during his absence, The life Erdeath,

misery, power, war, lust etc. have ultimately turned on him to
explore more truth and logic about the various happenings in
the system of the Universe. Can he charge it ? There lies the
the catharsis of the play. Mahatma Budha did not come back
to his home once he left on his voyage to discover truth but

Caligula comes back in his familiar
ambiguous effort to search the truth.
