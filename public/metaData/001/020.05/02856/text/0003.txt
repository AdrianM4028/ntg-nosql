'Asmita' visual ises Juli us Caesar as a theme of strife based on
concept of dictatership, liberty, ideals and mob psychology woven
dramtically into a historical backdrop of the Roman Empire.
'Asmita'

would definitely not like to do Shakespeare by mearly

exploring his historical

period/grandeur, eloquent speach

patterns

stylization, manners, sets and backdrop and thus limiting it to
document of past enacted for only academic interests.

a

It is always a matter of pride for every theatre person tobe involved
with Shakespear’s production’s and in that sense 'Asmita’ does not

stand a part but doing Seakespeare and before that Dr. Dhararnvir

Bharti’s 'Andhayug’, Dr. G irish Karnad’s 'Tuglaq’, 'Albert Camu’s'
Caligula, and Bhisrna Shahni's 'Hanoosh, is only a part of a process

of learning life and theatre together. An effort to otage its own
Hindustani version of the original play is merely an extersion of the
same process.
’Asmita' intends to high I ighten the contents of the play with
accent on realistic approach of acting and by seeing history nearly as
backdrop to touch the human psyche, emotions, shortcomings and
conflicts and thus help analyse the dictum that Shakespeare’s plays
are still relavant with their natural flair for contenproraity.
