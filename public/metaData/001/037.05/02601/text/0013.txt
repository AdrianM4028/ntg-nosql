The Boatman
of Padma
River Padma lay wrapped in
darkness. Oar in hand, the boatman looked around.
Nothing
was visible, not even the sprawling
trees nearby. It was a long way
to that village where he hoped to
set! his goods at the fair the
next morning. So he untied his

boat, 'and pushed oﬂ‘.

He rowed

and rowed—how long he did not

know. So engrossed was he in
planning his transactions and
counting his proﬁts that he did

not even feel the weariness of
rowing.

the distant trees. “Now the fair
must be in sight,” he thought.

Our country today is in a similar situation.
After 20 years of hard and earnest efforts to
improve the standard of living of our peopie,
We have not gone far from where we started,
though, of course, in certain areas we have
moved 3 long way. Take food production, for
instance. It has gone up by 17 miiiion tons
during the 14 years from 1951 to 1955 but the
amount of food available for each person
decreased by 0-4 02. What about employment
opportunities ? Educational facilities ? In these
and several other development areas, our efforts
have been nulliﬁed by the rapid rate of the
growth of population. We add to our population

tackle ?
