Writer's Note
In courts on earth, both common men and Presidents of nations have been
tried alike. But has anyone, till today. Filed a case of treachery against God ? Today's
self rnctivated, pleasure seeking man does so through the fantacy called MUKADAMA
BHAGWAN PAR.
MUKADMA BHAGWAN PAR is a penetrating satire on Man, his self praise
when things go well and his Fervent cries against God when in trouble. The play
packed with hilarious. comedy questions the very rights of God and his duties towards
human race.
The play is not an attempt to discredit any particular section of society of any
particular nat'on. It is a study in General. Audience may feel that the facts are
exaggerated. I agree. But the whole court-trial is exaggerated for no one till today
has witnessed a court-trial of god. . Otherwise also it is a fantacy. My due appologies
to those who are not what they are shown in the play.
