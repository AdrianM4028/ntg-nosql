YA Y ANIKA
............ One 8 a half decade of glorious life.

YAVANIKA has enterd the 15th year of its successful life. For a totally immature
group it is not very easy to servive so long and at the same time earn a cognizable
reputation.
We take pride in declaring that in the past few years of its life YAVANIKA has
presented the maximum variety of styles in Hindi theatre.

We started with simple social comedy 'Ret Ki
realrnost reputed theatre group.

Diwar' Which put us in the

'Khalid Ki Khala' which celebrated its golden Jublee,

is another crown on our head
In the line of social satire ‘Bada

Aadmi'. ‘Paisa Bolta

Hai'

and ‘Mukadama

Bhgwan Par' are our highly acclaimed plays.
YAVANIKA presented
‘AasadKa Ek

two great Classics of Hindi Literature—Mohair Rakesh's

Din' and Jagdish Chandra Mathur's,‘Pahala Raja’ which needless to

mention were highly apprecited.

‘Sabse Neeche Ka Admi' and ‘Mada Cactus' are

two thought provoking plays produced by us.
In the field of musical plays. we have presented 'Sagun Panchi'

Mayavi Sarover.

These were different in technique from

each other

'and Are!

but

were

presented with equal ease and success,

YAVANIKA has also contributed its myth in spreading national Integration and
family welfare by presenting 'lndradhanush' and ‘Dushman’. YAVANIKA is perhaps the

only drama group. which could successfully present ‘Bhagwan Mahabir’s life SIOVY
on the Stage in which Bhagwan Mahabir was presented in nude in order to present
the real theme, in our play JAI MAHABI R.

YAVANIKA has gained specific reputation in heart throbbing presentation of
horror and suspense plays—Kankal and Saraai, Now we are presenting the repeat
Show of our suspense Thriller Saraai on public demand.
In short YAVANIKA, entirely by dint of its energetic, sacrificing and ambitious

group of members and sympathisers has carved a nitch in the temple of diety of
Hindi Theatre.
