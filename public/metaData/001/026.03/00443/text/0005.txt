For thirty-two days the drama moves from one locale to
another and the audience moves along with it. When Ram
along with Sita and his brother Lakshtnan go to the forest
to begin their long exile, they have to cross a river. The river
ﬂowing by the town is the scene of this act. And the entire
audience goes there to bid tearful farewell.
There are permanent structures also; the palace of Ayodhya,
the ashram of the sage Vishwamitra and Panchavati, the
jungle hut where Sita was abducted by the demon king Ravan.
These structures are an integral part of the town’s architecture
and landscape.
The ﬁnale is a celebration of Ram’s return
from exile after defeating Ravan. Beﬁtting
a hero’s welcome, the ﬁnal act takes the
form of a grand royal procession.
And the stage for this scene is none
other than the main street of Ramanagar.
