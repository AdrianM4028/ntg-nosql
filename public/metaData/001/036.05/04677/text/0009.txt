PRESIDENT'S NOTE
Year 2004 came with bags full of excitement, energy and 'surprises'. We started
with workshops on rnusic/rhythrn and stylization. Then 'we‘ went on for an altogether
new experience. We scripted and directed our 'own' street play in 3 days. We felt the
energy that came out by being together and by being there for each other always.
The 'One Act' was result of the constant hardwork we did for two 'long' days. A
week — and the team was ready to face the competitions with full energy and well,
confidence. The weeks passed like few moments. And there came the final take
Full—Length. The late night practices, the fights we had, the scolding you got (well, I am

sorry for that) are memories that I'll cherish.The love that I got from — will stay
with me forever.

"Anukriti" will stay with me as a sweet memory of my college life. My all the best
wishes for "Anukriti". Love you "Anukriti"
Rewasa
