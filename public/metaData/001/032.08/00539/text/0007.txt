The Parvatiye Kala Kendra, a representative organisation of Kumaon and Garhwal hills, was established in 1968.
Its first programme of folk songs and dances of Uttarakhand was presented in 1969 in the presence of late
Smt. Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister. Since then,
the Kendra has been engaged in the task of preserving and
popularising the folk culture of Uttarakhand, contributing
in its own way to India's national culture.

The ‘Kendra' can boast of an impressive record during
the last eightyears. Its major production 'Rajula Malushahi’,
in Feberuary1980 and following persistent public demand,
again from May 19 to 25, the same year was considered
a landmark. It was followed by Gangnath Jagar, 'Ajua
Bafaul', Ramlila, Mahabharata, ‘Rasik Ramaul' Er 'Jeetu
Bagdwal'.

The Kendra has been moving in the direction of laying
a foundation of a distinct theatre of Uttarakhand. This
ballads
could also possibly be the only way to save these

link beetween the ballad singers of Uttarakhand
dwelling
modern generation of Kumaonis and Garhwalis
cult the
elsewhere in the country. The task althOUQh hdifti
a to
goal is quite inspiring of that has helped the Kendr
continue its efforts, despite heavy odds.
The Kendra has also staged hundreds of performances
Er
of folk songs Er dances of Uttarakhand in many cities
towns of India. A 25 member team of Kendra was
also sent to 5 Middle East Countries for 2 months in 1983

by the Indian council for Cultural Relations.
Now, encouraged by the success achieved during the
public
last 19 years and the support Er good wishes of the

more specially the art lovers, the Kendra is going to stage
yet another folk retual H IL - JATRA of Uttarakhand
which we trust will be appreciated by all.
