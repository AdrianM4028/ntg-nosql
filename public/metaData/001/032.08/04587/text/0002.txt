Coolie Begaar
The People of Uttarakhand are known for their love
of freedom. This is reﬂected in their songs, dances
and legends. When their freedom was attacked

during the British Raj, they collectively and
individually resisted the forces of oppression. A
number of people laid down their lives, many went
underground risking the confiscation of their
properties and thousands went to jail. In this heroic
history of the hill people the movement against

Coolie Begaar forms an inspiring chapter. The main
leaders of the movement were Shri Badri Dutt
I’andey, Shri Hat Govind Pant, Mohan Singh

Mehta, Barrister MukandiLal, Tara Dutt Gairola
and An usuiya Prasad Bahuguna.
