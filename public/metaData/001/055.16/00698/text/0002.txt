Aadmi Jo Machhuara Nahin Tha is
a play about individuals

and ambition and fish and fisherm
an, and of the inevitable
tr agedy of the poor fisherman
w

ho was driven to asking for

three boons; one after the ot
her.

It is a tale for all

times.

The play took some three
years to write and the fi
nal
shape was given to it after
long discussions with the
director Shri Rajinder Nath
and the members of the
SRC Repertory.
Some of them had worked this w
ay at the
time of the production of my l
ast play 'Jo Ram Rachi

Rakha' है and were Quick tn :pﬁvo the main idea
and to
come up with suggestions.
I personally feel that there

has to be a collaboration between the actor a
nd the

director on the one hand, and the playwright
on the other.
The play is definitely enriched by being s
ubjected to this

multi-level scrutiny and of course it hel
ps the playwright
explain and justify certain areas in the
play which the
director and the actors may be doubtf
ul or confused about.
Perhaps not all the discussions and sugg
estions are

fruitful or valid, but most of them are a
nd I see no other
way a play can take its final shape and
be both stageable
and meaningful.
