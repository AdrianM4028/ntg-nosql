Directorâ€™s Note
Ek Violin Samandar ke Kinare is based on the novel Ek Violin Samandar ke Kinare,

written by Mr. Krishan Chander. The expansion of the story forced everybody to
ponder over the presentation of this novel.

In the beginning of the reading session, we read many novels and plays but finally
we decided to do this novel, which was on of the best novel of his time. Although
the wide canvas of this novel and continuous changes of locals, incidents, gave
us a thougt to edit this novel. It was a difficult job to edit and drarnatise this novel.
But we took it as challenge rather than having a well-weaved script.
Without the complexity of the intellectualisrn, the play deals with the generation gap,
change of values, morals and ideas through a very simple love story. Simplicity is

the focus of the presentation.
I am thankful to all the artist of the Repertory Company, Mr. Bapi Bose, Mr. Kajal
Ghosh and my two young colleagues Mr. Parag Sarmah and Mr. Souti Chakraborty
for their valuable attachment with this production.
