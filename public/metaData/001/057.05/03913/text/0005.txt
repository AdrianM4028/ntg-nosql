SONG OF LOWINO
By Okot P; Bitck
Language : Tamil
Duration : 40 min.

On 13 January,2008
At Rabindra Sudan 7p.m.

This pertormance is based on a poem in thrree cycles by the Ugandan poet, Okat P’ Bitek; 'Lowino sithing in
the middle of a circle of ash, chanting a dirge, lamenting and mourning the death of her husband to the ways
at the white man’. Lowino names the many chains with which she has been bound and in doing so, contronts
the many keys she looks in her own hand. Lowino's dirge turns into an angry song ot freedom.

'Song of Lowino' began as an interactive collaboration between Hartman de Souza ot Khell, a Goa
based theatre initiative and kalairani of Koothu-p—pattarai. It is a solo enactment of the Ugandan poem.
