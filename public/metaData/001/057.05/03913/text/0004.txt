Ina biographical pertormance
Sabitri who narrates the story at
her way of acting , how she
coniures up and privileges her
selt over the character the other
self. The narrative is a way at '
doing’ in place at । behaving‘,
that is weaved into a web of
organic images, vocal and
physical. It is a pertormance
charged with precision and tlow
logically,

sensuously

and

lyrically in an exploration of
original human nature .
