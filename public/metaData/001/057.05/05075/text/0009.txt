LAKSHAPATHI RAJANE KATHE (in Kannada)
Produced by: ~Spandana, Bangalore
Written by: MS. Nagaraj
Directed by: B. Jayashree

SYNOPSIS
King Dharmasekhara banishes his senior queen for being childless. The
helpless queen, concealing her pregnancy, accepts the banishment and lives in
penury in a hut outside the city with the help of the minister. The boy born to her is
named Lakshapathi and he grows up to be a strong and virtuous young man. In
response to the King’s proclamation Lord Shiva comes down to earth and asks for
six miraculous objects to be given to him in six months. The four notorious princes,
sons of the junior queen, go out in quest of these objects hoping to get the throne for
themselves.

Lakshapathi’s identity is revealed and he too sets out on the back of a divine
lame horse in pursuit of these gifts. Adventures follow and the efforts of the wicked
princes to kill their brother are foiled. At last, Lakshapathi Raja procures these
miraculous objects, as also a divine bride who is in possession of these objects, and
returns. He becomes the King and the four brothers are posted as guards of the
kingdom’s frontiers.

DI REC TO R'S NOTE
Jogerata is one of the most popular forms of folk theatre in northern Karnataka.
It looks very simple but it is quite delicate and has everything a play has to have-—
music, dance, narration, acting, entertainment, purpose etc. It is inexpensive and
does not require a stage and can be performed anywhere; in the vicinity of a temple,
or an open area. It stands for the common man’s theatre.

Having intensively studied this form for years, it is proposed to experiment by

taking this form to the proscenium and adopt all the features of this form.
