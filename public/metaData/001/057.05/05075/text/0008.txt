Now it is Saraswati's turn, and she descends to a palace. Riches are a plenty, but

Saraswati gives him ‘brains' and ultimately all ends well.
Saraswati, goddess of the intellect, thus proves to be of more value than Laxmi,
goddess of wealth. Saraswati, however, does not ridicule Laxmi and asks her to be
with her forever.
