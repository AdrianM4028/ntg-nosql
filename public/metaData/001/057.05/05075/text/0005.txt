A newly wed couple come to town for a pleasure trip but by midnight end up in a
police lock- up where the woman is raped till she loses consciousness and the man is
beaten to death. The death is passed off as a case of suicide and the woman is left
lying on the road; she is picked up by the police next morning and, in connivance

with a woman of loose morals enjoying police patronage, she is booked under the
suppression of immoral traffic act.

The reaction of the townsfolk varies from choked whispers to loud protests,
from callous curiosity to unbridled enthusiasm for direct action with the intention of

manipulating the situation to suit diverse political interests.

Dl R E C TO R ’S N 0TE
As the synopsis of the play suggests, it belongs to a different genre where not
the Spoken words but the movements and sound patterns are of greater importance.
As such for its production we have to take recourse to various forms that have a firm
base in the collective social memory.
In the narrative portions we have made use of lyrics, tuned after the tribal

ballads, as can be heard in the northwestern hillt‘racts of Orissa and its neighbouring
Chhattisgarh area. In another sequence, where people are invoked to rise as one
against all sorts of socio-political oppression, we have freely borrowed from the
sound and dance pattern of Chhou. In certain choreographed compositions we have
used the dramatic essence of the spirit of Chhou Nacha and Dandanata. These

apart, we have made use of several other indigenous styles and forms to suit the
spirit of the play.
