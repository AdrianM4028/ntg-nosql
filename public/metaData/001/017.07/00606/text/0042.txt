‘ shan-e-oudh’.

‘SHAN-e-OUDH’ recreates in dance and song the splendour of Outh during

the reign of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. This period is considered the ‘Golden
Era’ of music and dance, and the Nawab‘s Court was renowned for the .
patronage extended to art. Here the most beautiful ‘ghazals’ and ‘thumris’
were sung and here the best of Kathak Dancers gave scintillating
performance of their art. From here sprang new forms of music and dance
symbolizing a happy synthesis of the two fine cultures of our civilisation.
Historians may not consider Nawab Wajid Ali Shah an ideal monarch, but
the nightingales in the garden of music have always sung. and will
continue to sing his glory. The King ascended the throne amidst “volleys

of cannons and songs of dancing girls... ' ’so says a contemporary writer,
and led a life regulated by the strains of music and the intoxicating
rhythm of dancing feet.
