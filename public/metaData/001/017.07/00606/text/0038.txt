tribue to nwab wajid ali shah

The late Nawab Wajid Ali Shah is known in history as the last King of
Oudh. Few know him as a great patron of arts and a true connoisseur of

music and dance. Fewer still are aware of the great contribution he made
to the cultural heritage of India in the field of these arts.
The Nawab was a great artist besides being a patorn and a critic. He, it
was who revived the Kathak style of dance. Shri Thakur Prasad, one of the
ancestors of Shri Shambhu Maharaj, Brijmohan Maharaj was the chief
dancer of his court. It is believed that the Nawab himfelf became the pupil

of Shri Thakur Prasad and played the part of Krishna in the ballets
composed by himself.

The Second great contribution of the Nawab was the introduction and
popularisation of the Thumri style of music. He was a great composer and
many of his compositions have become classics in the world of music.

In the midst of political conﬂagration of a collapsing kingdom he did not
lose the spirit of a true artist. He remained unperturbed in his devotion to

art. The most critical moment of his life moved him to compose
the

प

beautiful and touching song “Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Hi Jae". It was
the Olltpouring of his heart when he had to leave his beloved city of
PWanl/V to go into exile shorn of his glory and majesty. He may pale into
mSIgmflcance as a political figure but he will remain immortal as a patron
of arts: He is lost in the records of history but still lives
in the vibrations

of mu31c he created.
