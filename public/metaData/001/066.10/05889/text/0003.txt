15 the boy guilty or not ?
Just an inclination of twelve heads in

unision will send the boy to gallows, a
tender neck will break.

He belongs to the slums.

He belongs to the class who are declared
bastards despite a living father. He does
not know what a mother’s warm lap
feels like. He is a nobody. His nineteen
years of living has meant experiencing
nineteen hells. He has been accused of
murdering his father. They are mentally
different : one is angry, the other is
polite, the next one is shy, one is
arrogant, the next one is factual and the
next ........

Police reports and other proofs all
indicate the boy’s guilt. The noose has
almost reached his throat. The court is
waiting for the jury to give its final
verdict. They are almost agreed that the
boy is guilty.

Yet there is always something left
unanswered, truths, half-truths, lies,

falsehoods.
The jury is now in session.
Is the boy guilty or not ?
