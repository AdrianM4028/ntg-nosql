One rainy day, Jagan, in a frenzied state, lifts all the idols and throws

them into the river. Yelu tries to stop her but she fails and throws herself
in the river too. Within a few moments Yelu and the idols disappear.
Jagan feels as if the pressure of ambiguous symbols and the systems
which recognise the powers of those symbols are removed and now she
is free and her natural self.
