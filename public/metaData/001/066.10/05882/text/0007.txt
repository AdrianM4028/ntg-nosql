The Chief Minister ﬁnds himself not only combating the propaganda
of opposition parties but also dealing with internal discontent within his
own party. To project his image as an ‘honourable man’ he initiates a
cottage industry project on one hand and orders a fresh inquiry with
regard to Beesu’s murder case, on the other. In a very sly manner, the
State power manipulates the situation and Beesu’s friend Binda is
accused of Beesu’s murder and arrested.

SHAKUNTALA
Rangrnandal, Madhya Pradesh
Story : Kalidasa ३
Translation : Mohan Rakesh
Direction : Sankhya Ibotombe
Shakuntala begins with the passionate attraction of human beings and
ends with its rejection after having attained a new life through
benevolent affection. It establishes a link between heaven and earth,
creates a balance between satiety and rejection, between duty and
boundless love; discovers a relation between courtly life and life in a
hermitage and shows the triumph of a mature husband over
unrestrained youthful lust. It brings Man and Nature very close to each
other and relates cosmic consciousness with the consciousness of the
individual.
