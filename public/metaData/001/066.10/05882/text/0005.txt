PANCHA RATRA, written by Bhasa, based on the epic
Mahabharata, is unusual in its theme.

The play tries to evolve the fact that the war could have been avoided
by the timely intervention of the respectable seniors and Gurus. In the
present context, it highlights the responsibilities of the intellectuals.

The play begins with a Yagna Which has changed the soul of
Duryodhana and he commits his Dakshina to Acharya Drona. Drona
demands half of the state for the Pandavas. Shakuni tries in vain to
dissuade the committed Duryodhana. Shakuni trickily challenges Drona
to ﬁnd the Pandavas out from their hiding within ﬁve days.
Virat’s information of Kichak being killed bare-handed by someone is
enough for Bhishma to realise that it has been done by none other than
Bhima. And Bhishma suggests that Drona should accept the challenge
thus provoking Duryodhana to attack Virat for his Go-dhan. The
war begins with the Pandavas favouring Virat.
At last, the Pandavas are identified and Duryodhan hands over half of
the state as avowed earlier.

The play, rewritten by Rajesh Joshi, incorporates the local and folk
elements, as a result of which PANCHA RATRA not only assumes
contemporaneity, but also achieves a bearing on the theatre of today.
