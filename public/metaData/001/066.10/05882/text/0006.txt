AAJ RAAT
A nk , Bombay
Hindi adaptation, design and direction : Dinesh Thakur
A mystery of conscience, based on J.B. Priestley’s classic ‘An
Inspector Calls’.

It is not an ordinary whodunit suspense, but a mystery of conscience.
On the engagement ceremony celebration of a millionaire Raghvendra
Nath Rai’s daughter Rajeshwari Rai to another millionaire’s son
Ravindra Pratap Rawal, comes C.I.D. Inspector Khan, to investigate the
suicide of a girl. Apparently no one present there is involved, but as the
investigation goes on, we ﬁnd that each one of them is responsible for
her death. The investigation turns into an engrossing game of wits with
one’s own conscience. How responsible are we towards each other ...... ,
, and what is the signiﬁcance of human relationships and those we
interact with in the short cohesiveness of existence. This is the basic
human issue raised by this classic, which is of dramatic relevance to all
times and places.
