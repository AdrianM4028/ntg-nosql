Jagan is watched by every hungry eye in the village. She gets
emotionally involved with Jayanta, an upper class boy, who promises
to help for further studies by employing her in his farm. Jayanta
takes advantage of the situation, deceives her and marries some other
girl as arranged by his father. Jagan gets frustrated and agrees to become
a Jogtin.

ACT 11
Jagan the Jogtin is born after numerous rituals. The dream of
becoming a nurse is shattered to pieces. The same night Parsu engineers,
through a few goondas, a collective rape of Jagan and Yelu. Jagan,
shattered mentally and physically comes to her village and tries to be a
Jogtin, compromises for survival, but is ignored by the villagers.
In course of time she enters in to a ZULVA relationship with
Krishna, a divorcee from the same village who had stopped her from
committing suicide. Krishna also takes advantage of her...
Nature takes its course and Jagan attains motherhood. Now she faces
one more problem. Jagan’s breast goes dry. The infant remains hungry
and becomes sick. Yelu suggests to Jagan that she should totally
surrender to the powers of Yellarnrna to feed her child and recover
from the sickness. On the other hand, Jagan feels that her natural
fountains were dried up because she had surrendered too much.
