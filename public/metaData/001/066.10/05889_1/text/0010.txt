OUTSIDE
lways going beyond its
periphery, NANDIKAR has
worked with individuals and
organisations.

In 1968 NANDIKAR joined a
project, led by Sombhu Mitra, to gift
a Cultural Complex to the nation.
This project ﬂopped for want of a
piece of land and eventually the
money raised was donated to
Cancer Centre. In collaborationwith Theatre Workshop, Chetana,
Theatre Commune, Sudrak and
Charbak, NANDIKAR initiated the
CALCUTTA REPERTORY THEATRE
in 1980. Under its banner, Fritz
Bennewitz of Weimar National
Theatre directed Brecht’s ‘Life of
Galileo’, with Sombhu Mitra in the
title role. A pity that the endeavour
did not last beyond its maiden
venture. A three-day Brecht
Festival and Exhibition was
organised in 1982., in collaboration

Peter Brook's Theatre Days’.
