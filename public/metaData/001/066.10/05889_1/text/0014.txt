NATIONAL THEATEBE FESTIVAL : 1984-1990
' ' hile commemorating its
Silver Jubilee in 1984,
NANDIKAR felt that the divisive
and disintegrating tendencies
rocking our sub-continent could
not be countered by politicians
alone : cultural workers too had a
role to play. NANDIKAR also felt
that an interaction of multi-lingual
and multiâ€”cultural theatre forms
under one umbrella could help
Indian theatre workers to compare
notes.

Hence the first National Theatre
Festival in 1984. A cumulative
demand prompted NANDIKAR to

continue this festival from 1985 to
1990. During these seven Festivals,
4'? avant grade and experimental
troupes from 12 States of India as
also from Nepal and Bangladesh
presented 69 performances; 2.5
theatre luminaries of our country
were given felicitations with cash
award.

Over the years, thanks to the
cooperation of all and sundr , this
festival of NANDIKAR earned the
distinction of a major event in the
Indian cultural calendar, and the

theatre fraternity of Calcutta and
India recognised it as their own.
