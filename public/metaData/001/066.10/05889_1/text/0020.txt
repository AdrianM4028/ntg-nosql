THEATRE IN NON-FORMAL EDUCATION
nspired by Paolo Freire and
Augusto Boal, NANDIKAR has
over the past couple of years
experimented on the potential of
theatre for motivating educators to
use theatre as a tool for nonâ€”formal
education.
In 1990- 1991, under the umbrella

of Govt. of India and the State Govt,
NANDIKAR has organised a
number of theatre workshops to
animate the Literacy Programme
in Midnapore. As a result of this,
two stage productions have been
mounted and performed repeatedly.
