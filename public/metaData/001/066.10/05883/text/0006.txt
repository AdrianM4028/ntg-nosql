centuries later the poet of Meghanadbadh or his friends would
be alive no more, people would still be reading this epic with
‘untiring adoration’. it is difficult to assess the truth of this
statement. That the average literate Bengali is not unfamiliar
with the name of the poet or the epic is anundoubted fact, but
at the same time whether he remembers or reads each line
with ‘adoration’ also remains doubtful.
Many people, like Vidyasagar, did not understand
Madhusudan’s new rhyme-scheme in the beginning. Many

still do not. How his language should be spoken is yet to be
understood by many. Sometimes we hear that his language is
not Bengali at all. And so all that the poet has merited for his
epic is merely reverence—a detaChed glorified respect ; it has

been an epic often untouched by the sincerity of love.

Can one not grasp his rhyme-scheme? Can one not
comprehend his language ‘? When minutely attended, don’t we
find echoes of our daily conversation in his expressions ‘?

It may be that Nandikar has found an answer. This theatre
group, after a long tryst with the Western Theatre, is at last
making a home-coming. It is as though, Meghanadbadh
Kabya’ is leading it home after a long wait. This group is
trying to break the ice of the revered detachment for the
Kabya and very bravely relating it, after a long time, to our
everyday experience. What we mean to say is that this has
been presented on the Bengali stage earlier as well. In fact, a
