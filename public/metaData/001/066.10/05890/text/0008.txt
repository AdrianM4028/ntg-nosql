Flmalkanti Chowdhuru appears on stage, the sound of ﬂute
waiting in his ears. He is a tired man, living in the past clouded bu
dreams of his beloved son Babua, bu nightmares of his sensual
transgressions, bu a helpless longing for ‘what might have been'.
Once upon a time, he wore a fine jacket and shining shoes, he
was a salesman selling his dreams to people, making them dream
of beautiful things. Now, at 63, is he unaware that his shoes have
lost their glitter and his jacket is spotted with grease !
Twentu-five uears ago, he had started to build a ‘nest' for his
wife and his two sons. That was a time when there were trees and
ﬂowers all around his nest. Todau, that ‘nest' is surrounded bu a
concrete jungle of high-rise buildings, appearing like red-eued
monsters during the night. His garden, deprived of sun light, is now
barren although Flmal Hanti desparatelu tries to sow seeds. ﬁnd his
two sons todau are onlu visitors to his 'nest'.
Hmalkanti's sole friend Rajen is the onlu sumbol of the little
sanitu left in his life. Even Rajen cannot reach out to fimalkanti
helping him find a little space in this ruthless world of competition,
of deadlu power, of the monster called ‘Big moneu.’ Hfter all,
Hmalkanti still has some pride left in him.
His onlu guiding force is his ‘big brother'—a man who has
travelled through dense jungles in search of gold and diamonds, a
man who has never ﬂinched from springing over hurdles, however
dangerous the ordeal, a man who is dead !
ﬁnd so Rmalkanti continues to live in the past till his 'big brother'
shows the wau.
