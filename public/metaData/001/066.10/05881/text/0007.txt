himself to it. the Bengali National Theatre

In Bengal there was never any dearth of
good actors but we have always felt the
absence of a discerning dramatist. If one
surveys the history of drarrta one finds that
right front Sophocles to Shakespeare to our
present day Noel Coward all were well
aware of the theatrical traditions and the
grammar of theatre. Many of tltern were
actors. directors or stage rrtartagers. In
Bengal. except for Girishchandra arid
Amritalal. no other dramatist has his
experience rooted irt theatre.

Though there might be difference of opinion
as to whether Girish Ghosh gave birth to
Bengali theatre, undoubtedly he brought the
Renaissance to Bengali stage.
In Calcutta there are only 4 theatre halls. In
South Calcutta there is not even one single
theatre hall. There is not one theatre which is
architecturally pleasing or technically sound.

There is not even a single comprehensive
attempt to record Girishchandra’s
contribution to Bengali theatre. Till the time
our scholar critics realise the irnportartce of
theatre there cart be no respectable attempt
irt recording the history of the sarrte.

Rabindrartath was the ﬁrst amongst our
dramatists to realise the dichotomy of the
tradition which enabled the audience to sit as
judges arid the actors to be confined as the
accused on stage.
Amongst all forms of rrtass education the
theatre is the best. This ltas been
acknowledged by the Greek civilisation. the
Hindus, the Romans, by all major cultures of
the world—even in Communist Russia.
Our Hindu aesthetes refer to theatre as a

poetry of the visual. Hence, he is the best
dramatist who is aware of the Actor’s
supreme importance.

Girishchandra had all the skills required to
establish a theatre. Unless one is a great
leader and art actor with consummate skills
one cannot discharge the duties as a leader of
a troupe of actors.

The theatre is the crucible of the national
culture. It is here that all art forms
amalgamate. Dance, song, acting. literature
arid history all find their culmination in

Most people usually suffer from the
delusion that one need rtot ltave a wide

The greatest danger of establishing a
