Why National Theatre Festival ?
While commemorating its Silver Jubilee in 1984, NANDIKAR felt that the divisive and disintegrating
tendencies rocking our sub-continent for quite some time could not be countered by politicians alone: cultural

workers too had a deﬁnite role to play.
NANDIKAR also felt that an interaction of multi-lingual and multi-cultural theatre forms under one umbrella
could help Indian theatre-workers to compare notes.
Hence the ﬁrst National Theatre Festival in 1984. A cumulative demand for such National Iheatre Meets

prompted NANDIKAR to continue this National Theatre Festival from 1985 to 1989.
During the last 6 National Theatre Festivals, 39 avant garde and Experimental Troupes from 11 States of
India as also from Nepal and Bangladesh presented 62 performances. 21 Theatre Luminaries of India have been
felicitated.
Over the years, this National Theatre Festival has earned the distinction of being a major event in the
Indian Cultural Calendar.

The Theatre-Fraternity of Calcutta and of India have recognised this National Theatre Festival as their own.
