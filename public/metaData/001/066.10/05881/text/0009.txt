Workspho with PRRAS

The aim of this Project is to let the

Student know his world through
Theatre -~~to initiate his analysis of his
own milieu —to sharpen his inter-face

of the ‘I & The World’—to encourage
his perception of the changeability of
his world and to help him assume the
role of World-Changer. The ultimate
aim of Theatre-In-Education, of course.

is to enable the Student feel confident
about his creative power. We hope to
continue this vital work beyond this
year and hope other people will join us
in the venture.
