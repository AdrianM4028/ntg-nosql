NATIONAL THEATRE FESTIVAL. 1984—1989, A RETROSPECT

_

From the very beginning of this endeavour, the love and care, showered upon us by the high and the low of the
Indian Theatre, has been overwhelming.
39 avant garde and established troupes—some with repeated participation —from all over India, presented 62
performances in these Festivals.
Along with these 62 performances—featuring best directors, playwrights and performers of India, Nandikar, during the
last 6 National Theatre Festivals accorded FELICITATIONS, with cash awards, to 21 Theatre luminaries of India. Not a

bad job! Certainly if we consider the vastness and diversity of Indian Theatre and the meagreness of its representation.
Many States and troupes worthy enough are yet to find their place. Money, lack of communication and may be, our
myopia are to blame. We h0pe to atone in future.
