IN THE EYES OF THE PRESS

‘ANTIGONE’ (286 Performances so far)
Based on Sophocles & Jean Anouilh
Translated by Chittaranjan Ghosh
Directed by Rudraprasad Sengupta.
The PRESS Comments :

The Statesman :
“ANTIGONE an astounding creation of NANDIKAR”

Ganashakti :
“The production sky-rocketed because of the energy 1111-

leashed by the acting of Rudraprasad & Swatilekha”

Juga n ta r :
“ANTIGONE scales a dizzy height because of its expository technique and intense dramatic tension. Acting &
design, theme & technique, are combined into a poetry, as

it were.

Thanks to Rudraprasad Sengupta for offering us a

taste of the Epic and the Classic”

Am r i ta :
“ANTIGONE is a

significant

contribution

to

Bengali

Theatre Repertoire.

Here is a play which touches your

heart, makes you think. and inevitably a must for the distinguished and discerning spectator”

Anandabazar Patrika :
“ANTIGONE is Nandikar’s generous gift ........ Powerful
wood-cut

yet sensitive, each moment a

picture,

yet,

it

carries the depth and dignity of an ancient inscription most

intricately chiselled”
D esh :
“Picturesque ! - yes, Alive ! - yes, and perhaps something
more. If you praise it in poetic terms, the whole book
of Rhetoric would be required; in prose, you cannot

do justice to what you want to say.
