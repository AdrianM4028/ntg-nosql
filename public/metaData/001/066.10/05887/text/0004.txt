hugely so, in true Brecht ian style “Serigupta has scored
an enormous success technically. The use of Freeze and the
Quick-Cutting and the Changing of Scenes give the play a
Cir ematic Montage-Effect thereby quickening the tempo
The lilting music, parodying famous English and Bengali
songs, the choreography are altogether excel lent”

Amritabazar Patrika :
“The play FOOTBALL can be looked at and appreciated
from various levels — interesting horseplay, livening music,
satire, pantomime and straight drama. One has to admire
director’s technical expertise”

Frontier :
“The play FOOTBALL describes with razor-sharp accuracy
the frenzy that is inextricably mixed up with sub-culture
football"

Anandabazar Patrika :
“Songs are just not songs here but its life-blood.

Including

himself, Rudraprasad has conducted an orchestrated procession

of 55

human

beings

the

name

of

which

is

‘FOOT BALL’ "

Jugantar :
“The presentation, the atmosphere, the acting — total and

individual — are unforgettable. Sudden still movements
again and again are flashes of fantastic photography”

D 6 sh :
“We were laughing.

There was a mirror before us. Did we

ever know we were so ugly! This mirror is
current production FOOTBALL”

Nandikar’s

Am ri ta :
”A society — the entire Bengali race — runs whither at a
frantic pace is graphically etched in this production”

8at yaj ug :
“Rudraprasad offers an objectively original portrayal of the
youth today with its agony, anxiety, sense of void and its
moral decadence”
