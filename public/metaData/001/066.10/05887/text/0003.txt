given excellent performances and presented a whole range
of emotions with effortless ease”

Amritabazar Patrika :
“NANDIKAR’S ANTIGONE

is distinctive both for its

dramatic ﬁltration with death in a taut area of authoritari-

anism & ﬁdelity to a cause ; and tragic charisma that is
believed to suffuse such a set-up”
