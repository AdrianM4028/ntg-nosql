I

pull it off

but nowadays it is

something of a rarity.

“Rudraprasad Sengupta’s family is incredibly well ‘parented’

on this occasion by the astonishing Swatilekha Sengupta
in the dual role of ‘the good woman’. Ms Sengupta is,
being so placed, the mother and the father of the evening

and, if you are at any level a student of theatre, do not fail
to see this actress in this work
This is an actress,
truly of inﬁnite variety and how fortunate we were, and are,
to see her.

Fortunately too, that the company has

found a perfect playing partner for this leading lady, in

Gautam Haldar as the pilot.

A wonderfully widely ranged

performer with more utterly ﬂawless technique on display.

“This young actor

simply sits on the ﬂoor from a standing

position
It is movement, so graceful, so controlled, that Nyjinsky
could have managed it no better.
“There is no denying these two leading performers, but they,

I am sure, know and we feel, they would be simply nowhere
without the absolute congress of great work going on
around them, and at times above and below them.

‘This play, the director, the lighting director ( Tapas Sen )

and the set designer (Jamil Ahmed) have ‘Served’ the
actors beautifully. The transformation of a rudimentary
pair of stepladiers into a resplendent Cedar Tree, would,

alone have produced instantaneous applause in a theatre
of the western world.

“Run,don’t walk, to the next presentation of this production.
It is undoubtedly a credit to theatre, a credit to Calcutta,
a credit to the company, and it merits attention at an

international arena.”
