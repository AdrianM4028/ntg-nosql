Our next production

LETTERS HO ME
The life and times of Sylvia Plath
a play by Rose Leiman Goldernberg
On February 11th 1963, Sylvia Plath, saddened by the turbulent end of her marriage to
the poet Ted Hughes, enveloped in illness and disheartened by the coldest, longest
winter London ever knew, took her own life. In the month before her death, caring for
her children and worrying about her upcoming divorce, she poured out the brilliant
ﬂood of poems that would ‘make her name'. She knew it. She knew that she had ﬁnally
and in torment found her voice. She knew that she was strong and respected and ‘a
genius of a poet’. But that morning it was all too much, and she carefully poured milk
for her children, stuffed the doors and windows of her kitchen with cloths, put her head
down on the ﬂoor of her oven, and turned on the gas.
LETTERS HOME, based on the correspondence between Sylvia and her mother
Aurelia explores all the complex facets of this mother/daughter relationship. Hauntingly
beautiful and poignant, this play for two women has been performed to tremendous
acclaim all over the world. Our own production brings together Srnita Vats, last seen
in and as Anna Karenina, and Mona Chawla, last seen in her triumphant one women
show; ‘Female Parts’; as Sylvia and Aurelia Plath. Directed & designed by Feisal
Alkazi. The shows are scheduled for Nov. 16, 17, 18 at 6.30 PM. at the Shriram
Centre Basement Theatre.
