“To me the theater is not a disconnected entertainment, which
it is usually to
most people here. its the sound and ring of the spirit of the people
at any one time.
it is where a collective mass of people, through the genius of some
author, is able
to project its terrors and its hopes and to symbolize that.

Now how that’s done—

there are thousand ways to do it of course ...... i personally feel that the
theater has
to confront the basic themes always.

And the faces change from generation to

generation, but their roots are generally the same, and that is a question of man’s
increasing awareness of himself and his environment. his quest for justice and for
the

right to be human."
——Arthur Miller

The idea of doing a production of ‘THE CRUClBLE’ had been on my mind for
several years. Arthur Miller’s own personal anger and anguish during the McCarthy
witch hunt of the 1950’s had triggered off the writing of this piay. it was through the
process of researching the actual people and events of the Salem Witch hunt of 1692,
that he wrote perhaps the most ‘classic’ of his works. it seemed only correct for us
in India to wait for the most opportune moment to stage this work, that deals with the
terrifying consequences of the nexus between economics and politics, religion and
mass hysteria.
That moment seems like now—as we hurtle towards the 21st century. Within
days of starting rehearsal Roop Kanwar’s sati took over the newspaper headlines, the
ultimate secrifice that a feudal, patriarchial society could demand, the burning to death
of a woman in the public view of thousands, while an administration stood by quietly
watching. This is only one of the several parallels that we hope our production will
raise in your minds as you watch it. The play then becomes a reﬂection of our own

age—an age in which each one of us has to face the crucible in our own way.
