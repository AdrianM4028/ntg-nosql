“ R U C H I K A 9’

“Ruchika” is a teenage theatre group which encourages
fresh talent.

Mohan Rakesh’s “One Day in Ashadha" is the second
venture of “Ruchika”, the firSt being Adya RangaCharya’s
“Suno Janmejaye” direCted by Arun Kuckreja. The idea of

audience participation was fully elaborated in "Sunojanmejaye” by enacting some of the scenes in the audience, and

also by placing the sets there like wise the audience seating
arrangement was reshuﬁ‘led by dividing them into four classes
(experience, enthusiasm, desire and an ordinary person)
according to the needs of the play. This was appreciated fully.

We hope that you will appreciate this production and
will continue to patronize our forthcoming productions.
