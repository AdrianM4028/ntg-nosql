The woman is perfected.
Her dead
Body wears the smile of accomplishment,

-_ The illusion of‘a Greek: necessity :

Flows in the scrolls of her tbga, '
Her bare
Feet seem to be saying ८३
We have come so far, it is over.

' Each dead child coiled, a white serpent,
One at each little ,

' Pitcher of milk, new empty.

She has folded

'

~ Them ,back into her body as petals
Of a rose cloSe when the garden ३

:Stiﬁens and odours bleed
.
_.
From the sweet, deep' throats of the night ﬂower.
The moon. has nothing to be sad about,
Staring from her hood of bone.
' She is' Used to this, sort of thing.
Her blacks crackle and’ drag.

—" Sylvia Plath
