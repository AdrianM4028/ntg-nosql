Relations between people can’t be described
Without using values
But a play is about the nature of values

How can you know its meaning when you need values to ﬁnd It. ?
Perhaps your values are being questioned
Certainly a play must question or strengthen them
Well, people are on the move and so doors are open
Communication is possible

The artist admits he may be wrong
He hopes he hasn’t attracted your attention unnecessarily

He says only that to write he used the values by which he lives
And that for you only this is inescapable :
ln judging his play you use the values by which you live

And show who you are~it ls inescapable

Art can't avoid this eﬁrontery
It describes the relations between people and so the spectator is
judged
At least this makes criticism democratic

But remember: democracy is a more wrathful tyrant than
a dictator
