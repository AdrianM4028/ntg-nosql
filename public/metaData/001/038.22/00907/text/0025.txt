NOTE

As Norman Mailer world say : “Directing a play is a cross between a
circus, a military campaign, a nightmare, an orgy and a high". That’s the
reason I have chosen to direct Sakharam Binder. I dedicate it to two of my
oldest and ablest professional colleagues—R.K. Dhingra and Feisal Alkazi.
Dec. 1977
