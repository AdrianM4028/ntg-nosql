her of infidelity and beats her up. The
Naga who really loves her, knows the
charade must end. He tries to find a

way of shielding her and her unborn
child from Apanna’s wrath. He advises
her to take the agni pariksha ordained
by the village community so as to
establish her purity. In this case, the

agni pariksha is to hold a live cobra in
the hand without being bitten. If she is
unharmed, her innocence is proved
without shadow of a doubt.
Naturally, Rani emerges from the
trial byfire unscathed. The cobra glides
gently down her arm instead of striking
her, and the village elders, as well as
Apanna proclaim herto be a goddess in
their midst. But though Rani is vindicated her triumph is hollow. For she
cannot reconcile the two loves she has
unwittingly known - the caring gentleness of the Naga, whom she had
accepted as her husband, and the
adulation of the reformed Apanna. in

losing her dream world, Rani has lost
an integral part of herself.
But has Rani really lost her Naga
lover for good ? The actor refuses to
accept the sad ending or the Naga’s
death. The tale gains a new twist, illustrating how stories change to suittirnes
and tastes .
