Three youngrnen of the Kingdom of Rupnagar,
Nilkamal, the woodcutter’s son, Hiramon, the
blacksmith’s and Suvarna, the potter's son—under

revolt against the Rakshasa ruler of Rupnagar,
Vichitradanta. The Rakshasa is overthrown and
arrested. But it is the Wiseman who lives beyond
the snowhills who alone knows the secret of how
the Rakshasa can be killed. Hiramon, Suvarna
and Nilkamal set off for the snowhills with the
assurance that the man who comes back first with
the secret weapon for Rakshasa's destruction, is

promised the hands of the teacher’s charming
daughter in marriage and the throne of Rupnagar.

manage to mislead two of them, Hiramon and
Suvarna, who give up the quest and return to the
