Rabindra Nath Tagore's

Raktakarabi
(Red Oleanders)
A Drama in One Act.

(Poet‘s Preface to the Play)

This play is based on real life.

Readers will only cheat

themselves if they depend on professional historians to
collect evidence if and where the events of the play

took place.

It will sufﬁce to say that according to the

Poet’s knowledge, it is completely true to life. Geographers may differ about the exact name of the locale or
place where the events take place.

But everyone knows

that it is popularly called the Yaksha Town. Scholars
tell us that in the mythological Yaksha Town, Kuvera,
the god of wealth had his golden throne.

But this

Nand[I1 1'

play is not at all about mythological times, nor is it
an allegory.

The place 1 refer to has the wealth of the

Yakshas, or the sectarians of Greedy Death, hidden

underground. They have got the information and begun

digging tunnels under the earth, so people have ascribed
to it the pet-name of Yaksha Town. In this play we

will meet in time the diggers of the tunnel.
