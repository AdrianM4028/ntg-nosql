There is in her only the mirror-image of her master’s desire and liking.

Both Bulu and Tapan have a good and enjoyable companion in their family friend, Dr. Roy.

He is a good

talker, ever alive to every bit of their life that is truly amusing. Nevertheless, behind his mirth Dr. Roy silently
endures the pang of an incurable disease which he terms as a legacy from his forefathers.

There is yet another friend of the family, Mrs. Krishna Lahiri.

She was quite intimate with Bulu in early

She married and lost her husband only too soon to have any permanent footing of her own.

This marriage was just a passing phase of her life where the need for money subordinated every other consideration that a girl of her age and taste was prone to have. To cut a long story short, there was anything but a

feeling of love in her relation with the man she had chosen to live with.

Silently in her, Krishna has a sense

of pride that she could sacriﬁce her personal likings and element of happiness for the sake of her mother.
Krishna’s story enthuses Bulu to a point where she_ gives out, almost unawares, one of the most carefully
preserved secrets of her life.

She tells Krishna how when Tapan was once laid up with a serious illness, she

secretly arranged for a loan of two thousand ﬁve hundred rupees all by herself and thereby saved Tapan from

Now, Bulu had borrowed this money from Kestopada.

It was a strange coincidence that this Kestopada

was an employee of the bank which Tapan joined as the Manager, and it was Tapan who issued orders for the
termination of his services on a charge of fraud.
Tapan so that he can get himself reinstated.

Kestopada approaches Bulu for advocating his case before

The queer ways of coincidence are again manifested in two

things—one is that Krishna is selected to succeed Kestopada in the bank, while the other, having a yet greater

bearing on the entire story, is that in their early age Kestopada and Krishna had such intimate feelings about
each other as could easily be expected to steer up their relation to marriage.

Unfortunately, Kestopada’s
