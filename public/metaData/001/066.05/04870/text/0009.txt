CSqnopsis 096 “gDulul “Lela"

Out of his need for self-defence. man created the society.

Society, on the other hand, has ever been after moulding

the life of man.

In the rivalry that thus emerges in the

relation between man and society. the former is most
often reduced to a doll.

The main characters of the play. Putul Khela. are all
conspicuous by the resemblance they bear to some dolls
who are constantly at strife with one another and have
to act at the same time.

Bulu‘s is a small household. with Tapan. her husband,

having law as his profession. Rantu and Rina. the son
and the daughter. being just in their early teens. a maid
servant having proved her loyalty over long years of

faithful services and a male servant—just the sort one
needs for the outdoor work.

The play starts at a point where one phase of this family
just terminates and another takes its start.

So long the

way of life had the prick of poverty in it.

But Tapan.

as we ﬁnd at the outset. has just succeeded in finding

out for him‘self the job of a Bank Manager.
