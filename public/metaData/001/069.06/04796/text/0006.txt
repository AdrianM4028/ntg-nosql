Performances translations and the remaking of literary
works through theatre has been a part of the ongoing
concerns of the training and teaching projects at the
N SD .
This project seeks to undertake a three way translation
of literary works from the great compositions of
Rabindranath Tagore in Bengali to a language spoken by
less than approximately ten million speakers such as
Santhali, and also Hindi for subtitling.

I am very happy that three poems of Tagore — Vadhu,
Didi and Devta ka Gras, have been translated into

Santhali and created into performances in this workshop
that has been led by Pravin Kurnar Gunjan, Jeetrai
Hansda and their team.

Apart from Santhali this initiative hopes to translate
Tagore's works in Bodo, Dogri, Konkani, Manipuri, and

Nepali and to present these with subtitles to create a
three cornered dialogue.
In this way we hope we can share and understand the
varied and complex cultural literary and performance
worlds ofour country.
