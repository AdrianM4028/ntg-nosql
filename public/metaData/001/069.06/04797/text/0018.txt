T h e p I ay
Human Nature is strongly bounded with its own desires and tendencies, But the idea of "Living
the life'" is distorted now. We are now abandoned in the cage of our so called SELF. The so called
Solitude of our SELF is so strong that we are now the slave of our SELF. And on the name of this
solitude and self freedom we are doing that journey, which is full of stench, bi—furcated Humanity,
rotten ideas of Philosophy, a Hub—Bub crowd and among these a Deadly Silence of SELF. We
have no any idea, no any solution to come out from this. We have no any idea of total freedom of
the whole Humanity without violating the circle of Others.
