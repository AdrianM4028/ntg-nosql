Th e p I ay
A young man, searching for a math, encounters an elderly man and gets into a dialogue
with him. Both the characters are mysteriously in sync with each other. Where is this Math? Who
lives there? What had happened when. . ..? The play is not about answering these questions. It
speaks of love, agony, pain, connect and all that exists unseen.
The meaning of one's life changes with the weaving in and weaving out of other lives.
Satish Alekar's play “MATH KE RAASTE MEIN EK DIN” is one of the finest narratives of the
same. The play was written in 2011. While writing it, the elderly man, started speaking a
monologue which Alekar had written a year after his wife passed away in 2007. Interestingly, the
monologue is an independent piece that is totally autobiographical and stands alone like a diary.
The play too has a very individual feel about it but is also story-like. Yet, when combined the
pieces complement each other objectively.
In Satish Alekar's words, “They say theatre is a reflection of life, but at times it works as a
therapy too.” AKS, once again, presents this reflection with all shades and hues of life.
