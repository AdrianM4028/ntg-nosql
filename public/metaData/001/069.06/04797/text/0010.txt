Flocks of peo
life to live like a normal human being.
But they don't give up. Scattered and uprooted from their insecure dwellings, they again log
down their bamboos and plastics for a new home.
Destined to move, they keep wandering for a new destiny a new address even after all these
63 years of independence.
