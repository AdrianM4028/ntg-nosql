The STory of MaTsyagandha as depicTed in The Adi
Parva of Mahabharata is exTremely inTense, dramaTic
and aims aT projecTing The fundamenTal values of human
life. Kanefkar has inTerpreTed several sTrains and sTresses
wiThin The framework of The narraTive of Emperor ShanTanu
and Prince Devavrata. Prince DevavraTa wiTh his sTrong
deTerminaTion and pledge of celibacy acquires The
sTaTure of PiTamah Bhishma. This greaT warrior becomes
imprisoned in a web of his own pledge, becomes
exTremely lonely, frusTraTed and falls prey To The curse.
Matsyagandha, a young fishermaid Though becomes
The powerful empress and yeT remains hurT, confused
andlonew.
The Play unflods in an inTeresTing and dramaTic
manner. Near The Himalayan ranges The young beauTifuI
fisherrnaid, The cheerful Matsyagandha (SaTyawaTi) Takes
people in her boaT from one bank of river To The oTher.
Once, Rishi Parashar comes There and is aTTracTed
Towards her and her charms. She also gives herself away
The Rishi and Their wedlock in secrecy resulTs in
menTary maTing. Parashar blesses SaTyawaIi wiTh a
boon of divine virginiTy and Takes The responsibiliTy of
bringing up The child. She geTs hurT by The self—
cenTeredness of men in general. AT This Time, Shantanu
sees her and wishes To marry her. SaTyawaTi in a mosT
complicaTed manner insisTs on a promise according To
which prince DevavraTa will have To remain single all his
life and serve her sons. Years afTer, on her own sons’
deaThs she persuades Bhishma To geT married. BuT he
denies This requesT firmly and conTinues sTruggling wiTh
his proverbial curse of loneliness.

InTeresTing characTers like The loving bridal princess
Amba, FaTherly Dheevar, wiTTy Chandol, loyal friend
Priyadarshan add To The complexiTies of The proTagonisT
and enable easy idenTificaTion of The narraTive in The
conTemporary conTexT.
Malsyagandha

complex sTory.
SaTyawaTi’s Journey, from a young maiden To a
married woman Then To a grieving woman and finally To
a lonely suffering moTher is well presenTed.

IT depicTs vivid human experience enriched wiTh
dramaTic happenings, versaTiIe characTerisaTion, faTal
co—incidences, miracles, plighT of desTiny and curse of
naTure. Above all, The play presenTs human beings fighT
wiTh desTiny for high humane values and search for a
meaning of life. IT also provides impressive glimpses of
The famous TradiTion of Musical Theatre of MaharashTra.
