Scene 11
Scene 8

Basavanna informs the assembled
sharanas that the King has been
imprisoned in his palace, and that as
he had given the sharanas protection,
they should stand by him now. Most
of the sharanas do not agree to this
proposal and disperse.
Basavanna calls to God for guidance,
and is answered through the voice of
a crying child. He decides to go to the
palace the following day, repay his
debt to the King, and then leave the
city for good.
At the Palace, the King waits
desperately for Basavanna to come
and rescue him. When he does come,
however, Basavanna is accompanied
only by 770 sharanas, the greater part
of his following having deserted him.
There is an awkward meeting

that a miracle has indeed occurred,

Shiva. He is enticed out of the inner
sanctum by Jagadeva who gratuitously
kills him to save face.
In an act of foolish bravado, he
commits suicide over the Shivaling.
