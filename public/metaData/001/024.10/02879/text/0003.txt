Many of us have gone through this experience in life; of fighting over U
the worldly possessions of a sick parent. Often in his or her presence - thereby

displaying complete insensitivity to the fragility of the moment. ‘Sklrmishes’ is
about sibling rivalry; about two sisters battling over their ‘property’ - their
mother and her house.

Rita returns home to be with her mother, who has had a stroke. She
and her sister Jean, who has been nursing mother for some months, argue
bitterly over their responsibilities towards the aged parent. Jean resentful that
the hard slog of caring and nursing has fallen on her, Rita incensed that
mother's large house has been willed to her sister.
They rehearse all the squabbles of the past, within the framework of
Jean's barrenness and Rita's good fortune in having two children and a loving
husband,- occasionally attacking mother too. The old woman responds only
when the bickering between the two sisters is at its worst; waking to a frothing
consciousness when the women reach a peak of mutual vindictiveness. With
the seizure comes a pronouncement that shocks the sisters into silence - a
silence as deafening as the din of their skirmish.
The play views life from the underside; scratching the surface to reveal
the rawness within,- a rawness that is a part of each one of us.

There is very little information available about Catherine Hayes, except

that she is a British author. She is not a feminist writer and ‘Skirmishes’ is either
her first, or maybe the only play she has written. Her characters are well _
fleshed-out. And she has a feel for the weird and the uncanny - as most of
the bits with the sernl - comatose mother will testify. The play was ﬁrst presented
at the Liverpool Playhouse on April 15, 1981, and subsequently at Hampstead I I
