JOINT WOMEN’S PROGRAMME
Introduction
'
The Joint Women’s Programme was started in 1977. It is a movement of women for
their freedom and creation of a new society with equal partnership of women and
men. It is open to all those who believe in its objectives and willing to participate in
the specific struggles of the JWP. This unique feature of the JWP makes it one of
the few women's movements where men are also a part of the struggle for women’s
_ human rights.

Perspectives.

For the JWP, the women’s question in India is both a concern of the female sex and
important part of the interrelated phenomena including caste, class, ethnicity, culture,
religion, etc. The JWP’s programme to combat this total system of oppression and
exploitation is therefore comprehensive in nature .The emphasis is on grass-root level
organising of women and the community in the rural and urban areas; issue based
campaigns, networking at the regional and national levels among women’s

groups

and others; studies; research; publications; documentation; cultural action; seminars;

conferences and workshops related to action. Increasingly the legal and socio-econornic rights of women as will as their struggle for human rights are attracting the

attention of JWP. Church related programmes are also an aspect of JWP work.
