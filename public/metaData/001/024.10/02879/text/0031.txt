"IHREE TALES OF THE UNEXPEC'IEI)’,
WRITTEN BY ROALD DAHL AND DRAMATISED BY SOHAILA KAPUR (ReviewS)

“The sleek and stylish dramatisation and direction by Sohaila Kapur for Katyayani theatre

group captured efﬁciently the inimitable satirical humour in ‘Three Tales of the Unexpected’
. . . Sohaila Kapur’s achievement lies in taking up oﬁ- beat stories . . . The racy dialogues

and the sequences were so perfectly timed that the climax turned out smoothly. . . ”

-Sushma Chadha, "The Evening News of India"

“It requires tremendous skill on the part of the director and the actors to reproduce Dahl’s

fantastic balancing of the comic and the grotesque. Katyayani’s dramatisation, directed by
Sohaila Kapur, was simple and neat . . ”

—Javed Malick, "The Times of India’
