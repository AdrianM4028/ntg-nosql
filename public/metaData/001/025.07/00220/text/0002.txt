Political independence would be

independence... It is only when we are
hundred per cent self-sufficient in our

needs that we can be strong.

SELF-IIELIANGE
Swadeshism was the bed-rock on which Golden Tobacco
Company was founded. Self-reliance, which stems from
Swadeshi spirit, has all along been its driving force. Facing
and ﬁghting foreign monopolistic domination, the company
has attained pride of place in the Indian cigarette industry.
Now on the threshold of a major expansion, Golden Tobacco
rededicates itself to self-reliance as a creed and a crusade.

INDIA'S OWN, YOUR OWN T00 !
N me fine brands, 100 per cent
Indian as distinguished from
most Cigarettes which are made in
India by substantially foreign
companies and therefore drain
away precious foreign exchange.
