The Playwright’si Notes
A defence against Edward Gordon Craig’s pronouncement, that the

playwright is an ‘intruder’ in the theatre, may be found ' in the " fact
that, of all the theatre’s workers, it is the playwright who can point
out new terrain where resources shall not be exhausted in a production or two—not that playwrights are always, or solely, playwrights;
for writing is an act. To return from one’s digression: the playwright, being in search of probable structures and patterns, is the
३ man on the mast of the theatre’s Santa Maria and in that Sense its

helmsrnan. ३ '

The relation between the playwright and the director determines the
sort of theatre that takes place on the stage.
On the stage, the actor is a schizophrenic ﬁgure. He is his human
self, the actor in him and the character he attempts to create onstage.
. He needs a lot of space, and he must be expected to ﬁll-in a lot of
space. The plawright must give him that space, rather than make

him a bundle of words. It is for the actor to create the space for his
person, beyond the despotism of the director.
Every production is an interpretation. There is no such thing as
‘the playWright’s production’; it could only be his interpretation. '
. . . To write - a political play in a ’ non-political language . . . To
apprehend structures that did not seem to exist previously . . {To
discover archetypal patterns, the number of which is inﬁnite . .‘ . To
try again and again to see the same things that are about _ us I till one
feels in them the presence of forces one did not perceive earlier -. .- . To
disregard literary laws that. are well-known, or should be; such as,
‘good taste’ . . . To always hOpe that one’s audience is more sophisticated and perceptive than oneself. . '.
