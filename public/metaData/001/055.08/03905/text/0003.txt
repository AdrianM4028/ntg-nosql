The Play : The Seagull
The Seagull' (Hansani) is Anton Chekhov’s classic drama of spurned love,
restlessness, frustration and self deception. It centres on the romantic and artistic
conﬂicts between the established traditional actors and the struggling new artists and
between experimental playwrighting and famous writers.
‘Hansani' attempts to provide an insight into the world oftheatre and the body politics
operating within it. It tries to unveil the clash between human emotions and the space
ofan actor.
"His dramatic effects are most varied and often unconsciously employed,‘write
Stanislavsky. "At times he is an impressionist, at times a symbolist; he is a realist”
where it is necessary, and occationlly almost a "naturalist".
