CARDIGAN YOUTH THEATER

' Fifty years ago, the ﬁlm “The Wizard of OZ” amazed
and delighted audiences of all ages, and has since played in
cinemas all over the world. In this year of its ﬁftieth anniversary
the Children ofCardigan Youth Theater are proud to present
a new adaption especially for the youth of today called “Zero

Zero Zee _
Zee, The Wizard of Discs”.
DIRECTOR 2 COLIN KING

The children of Cardigan Youth Theater have devised this show through improvisation, using the same plot and
characters as the ﬁlm, but now the land of 02 becomes in
modern terms “The Yellow Brick Disco”, and the characters

are up to date versions of all the old favourites. The ﬁlm in its
day was a marvel ofthe then technological innovation and sowe
are now using even more amazing effects to re-create the
magical atmosphere of the original. All the music is of the kind
heard in discotheques today, specially chosen by the childrenas
representative of the characters portrayed.
