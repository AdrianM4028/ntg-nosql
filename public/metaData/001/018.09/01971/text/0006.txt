I am glad to learn that 'India Theatre Olympiad '
will be held under the auspices of the National Institute
of Performing Arts from 13th February to 22nd February,
1989.
2.
It is heartening to note that a large number of
countries are expected to participate in this theatre festival,
which happens to be the first of its kind in this country.
ri‘hat the festival is being organised in the centenary year
of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, is a humble tribute to his vision
of 'International Peaceful Co—existence'.
3.
I send my best wishes to the organisers and
participants for the success of the festival.
