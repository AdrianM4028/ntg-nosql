MESSAGE
It is with great pleasure that l have heard of the Indian Theatre
Olympiad in Chandigarh, New Delhi and other cities from
February 13 to 21 , 1989. I welcome the initiative of the organizers
to hold this international theatre meeting for an exchange of ideas

and different forms of artistic expression.
I am particularly pleased to see the German theatre group

'SANDKORN THEATER' from Karlsruhe participate in this event
and present contemporary German acting. I wish all those who
have made the India Theatre Olympiad possible 'and participate in it
a rewarding experience which they will cherish to remember in the
future.
