Yukionna-The Snow Fairy
Duration : 35 minutes
Synopsis of the Ballet :
Performers :

Winter.The Snow Fairy finds a young man lying in the
snow and they fall in love, though the Mother Fairy
opposes their love.
Spring.The Mother Fairy comes before the Snow Fairy
and the lad, and offers a gorgeous Cloth to the lad. The Q
Snow Fairy asks him not to take it, but he accepts the

gift.
Summer.There comes again the Mother Fairy and this
time she presents ‘a goreous clothers’ to the girl. The lad
is eager to have her wear the clothes.
Autumn.The Mother Fairy appears, casting amorous
glances. The lad leaves the Snow Fairy to herself and then
begins to dance with the Mother Fairy. He loses his
mental and physical balance and falls down. The girl is
frightened and runs to him, when it begins to snow.
Regaining her former self, the Snow Fairy takes off her
gorgeous clothes and begins to dance. She ﬁnds the lad
lying in the snow, but she pays little attention to him and
continues to dance in the heavy snowfall.
Through this dance performance, the author aims to
show the birth, growth, decline and death of love between
the Snow Fairy and the lad through the changes of four
seasons, thereby giving symbolically with the impotence
and limitations of the human being.
