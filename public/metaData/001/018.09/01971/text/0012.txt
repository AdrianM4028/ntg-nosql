Ambassador of Japan

MESSAGE
I am delighted to know that the National Institute of performing
Arts, is launching the Indian Theatre Olympiad with close
cooperation of International Amateur Theatre Asociation and its
member countries from 13 to 21 February, 1989, and that
popular theatre artists from various countries are participating in

the Olympiad. The pre-eminence of the theatre in the cultural life
of a community lies as much in its social signiﬁcance as in its
artistic appeal. Therefore, theatre movement and consciousness is

a unique underlying symbol of the cultural heritage and, when fully
explored and propagated with dedication, will be able to give ﬁIIip
to the broader understanding and friendly relations among the
people throughout the world. I note with happiness that the
opening performance after its inauguration is by The Toyarna
Theatre Group of Japan.

I offer my best wishes both to the organizers as well as to the
artists for the success of the Theatre Olympiad.
