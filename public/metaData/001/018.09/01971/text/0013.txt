MESSAGE
It gives me great pleasure to greet the organisers and participants

of the India Theatre Olympiad.
Last October the world witnessed the successful hosting of the '88
Seoul Olympics, a festival of joy and gaiety. One of the chief
attractions of the Games, was the Seoul Olympic Arts Festival in
which many theatre groups and artists from many countries gave

grand performances, promoting international peace and
friendship.
I am sure the India Theatre Olympiad will prove to be successful,

and also it will help National Institute of Performing Arts in
achieving its objective of propogating and protecting various

branches of performing arts in India and abroad.
