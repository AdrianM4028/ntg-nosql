Tobikichi has a chronically faint heart. He is now thirty

decided to ask for the hand of Tomie, his neighbour’s

TOYAMA

The delegation is composed of members of a theatrical
group (Bungeiza) and a dancing group (Kasai-Kiyoko
Dancing Studio) that belong to Toyarna Prefectural
Artistic & Cultural Association.
Bungeiza was founded in 1947 and since then has made
remarkable theatrical activities nationally as well as
internationally. They won Premier Award at 1977 Dundalk
Maytirne Festival and many awards at 1981 Westchester
Festival in 1981. In 1982 they were invited to Hungry to
give performances and to Los Angeles Olympic Memorial
Festival in 1984. They got Prizes from Suntory
Foundation and The Japan Foundation.
Kasai-Kiyoko Dancing Studio participated in 1984 Los
Angeles Olympic Memorial Festival to give a dancing
performance together with Bungeiza, and in 1985 gave
performances at Flower Carnival, Debrecen, in Hungary

and in 1987 at Detroit Olympiad ’87.

In his traditional full dress, and with a beating heart, he
sets out to make a formal proposal to her. He sits down
face to face with her. So far everything has gone very
well, but when he opens his mouth something goes
wrong. Quite unexpectedly, things go their own way to
the turnultous ending.... ..
