SQUABBLE —

(Speech, Facial Expression, Gesture)

The amateur theatre troupe consists of 16 to 19 years’ old
boys and girls. Founded in 1980, the troupe has given
many performances in the country and has participated in
national and international theatre festivals in Bulgaria and

Austria.
The efforts of all the participants are directed towards
mastering the basic means of expression of the theatrical
magic through their youthful audacity and imagination.
The repertoire groupings of the troupe are determined by
the participants’ preference for short dramatic forms adapted theatre miniatures, literary compositions,
sketches, farces, grotesques.

With its bright theatrical performances the troup aims at
driving away boredom from the stage and paving the way
for harmony and beauty.

SYNOPSIS OF THE PLAY

The play “SQUABBLE” consists of two parts - “If a Body
Meets a Body” and “ Dancing Competition”.
The first part includes some poems by Robert Burns,
showing the young people’s views about love, marriage
and family life. This performance is a musical and plastic
picture of the passing feelings and moods of our
contemporaries.

The second part is an attempt to find the roots of
theatrical acting in Bulgarian folklore; and attempts to
penetrate into the wealth of colour, words, sounds and

rhythm, characterizing the Bulgarian sense of beauty.
This is a vocal-dance presentation of an old traditional
folk game between young people.
