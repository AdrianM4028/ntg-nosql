Iam indeed happy to know that Chandigarh Chapter
ofNational Institute of Performing Arts (NIPA) has planned
to organise Theater Olympiad in Chandigarh with the active
support of International Amateur Theater Association, a
corporate body of UNESCO (Denmark).
NIPA, though a new body for the theater lovers of
Chandigarh has taken a commendable initiative to present a
big feast of highly entertaining cultural performances. This is
an undoubtedly a unique experiment to present teams from
nine foreign countries. It is hoped that Chandigarh audience,
known for its perception and applause would cherish various
themes tobe projected through plays and othertheater items.
Since a large section of international theater performers
would assemble at one place, the theater Olympiad would go
a long way inbringing about culturalintegration when best of
the theater advancement in the world would be presented.
.
I appreciate the bold initiative and meticulous planmngofNIPAin theyear ofthe Birth CentenaryofPt. Jawaharlal Nehru who himself was a great admirer of theater and
performing arts.

I wish the Theater Olympiad all success.
