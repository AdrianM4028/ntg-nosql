It is heartening to know that the ’lndian Theatre Olympiad‘ is going
to be held under the auspices of National Institute of Performing
Arts (NIPA) from February I 3 to 22, 1989 simultaneously at
Delhi, Chandigarh and some parts of Punjab.

The effort of NIPA at propagating, developing and preserving
various branches of performing arts in India and abroad is
welcome. India has a rich cultural heritage and the traditions of
Indian Theatre have been a perennial source of inspiration for the

contemporary world. I hope that the International-Theatre Festival,
being hosted by India will contribute a lot towards creating an
atmosphere of better understanding and friendship among various

countries through interaction and exchange of ideas of people
belonging to different ethnic groups, differents races and
professing different religions.
I wish the Festival all success

Devi Lal
