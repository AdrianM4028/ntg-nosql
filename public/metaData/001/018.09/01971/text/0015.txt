WELCOME. MESSAGE

Words fail me to express my happiness as I see the dream of
National Institute of Performing Arts realising itself. The idea of
organising ‘India — Theatre Olympiad' was conceived way back
in 1985. and gradually this momentous project developed over
the months. And last few weeks for all of us who worked together
on this project, were full of anxiety. Despite numerous constraints
and set backs we were always encouraged especially by people
like Mr. Ashok Pradhan, Adviser to the Administration of UT,
Chandigarh, to carry on with this task. Our thanks to him and
many other friends, who gave us strength to realise our ideal of
bringing people of different countries together on a single
platform, and through theatre, forge bonds of friendship and
understanding between peoples.
l. on behalf of the National Institute of Performing Arts,
Chandigarh Chapter, and the Organising Committee of Theatre
Olympiad, extend a very warm welcome to the famous troupes
from abroad to our this 'City Beautiful’. We have done our utmost
to offer the best possible comfort and do hope that any lack on
our part will be taken sportingly and excused as friends.
The presence of Mr. John Yttebor'g, Secretary General,
International Ameture Theatre Association, Denmark, and other
world renowned theatre personalities during the festival will be a
source of great inspiration to us.
We are sure that this global theatre festival, unparalleled in the
history of Indian Theatre, will go a long way in promoting
international goodwill, harmony and understanding among people
of different nations.
