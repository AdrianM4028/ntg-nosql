Synopsis of the Play

While the queen is dying the Spanish king demands that
his Flemish Jester, Folial should divert him. Folial tries to
strangle his master, but his will fails. In a cruel game, in
which King and Jester change places, the truth is
eventually revealed. The queen dies, poisoned, because
she preferred‘the Jester with the kineg soul to the king
with the soul of a Jester.

The play has been set in the Escorial during the downfall
of the Spanish Golden Age (XVIth Century). It is very
probable that he refers to Philips II ( 1527-1598) but then
especially as the personiﬁcation of the inquisition, which
in this way he can account with too.
