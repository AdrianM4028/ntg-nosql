I had written the play "Mrs. Roopa" in English about a decade ago. I fished out the
manuscript and translated it into Mara l hi in record time. My main task was to choose the right
actors and balance the "good old" with the "brand New". Without hesitation, I approached
the talented Mrs. Rajeshwari Rao whom I had to coax to accept the difficult role. Her equally
talented young daughter Indira Rao was my next target and I scored a bulls‘ eye. R. Vittal Rao
is a new enthusiast. The other actors have had previous experience in acting and they nave

proved their mettle.
Most of the reheasals were held at the residence of Shri V. E. Dinakar Rao. His wife
Rajeshwari had the triple burden of acting, running the house and serving the actors daily with
snacks and tea. Hats off to her. All the actors and actresses braved the cold weather to attend
the rehearsals on time. A spirit of enthusiasm prevailed all through and I felt at ease to do my

job.

I thank every one of them for the co-operation.

On the production side, the last scene takes the pride of place where the entire house
is set ablaze. I hope the special effects would prove realistic.
