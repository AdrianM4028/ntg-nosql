It is a matter of wonder as to how this scholar read the reference books and wrote
this valuable book, Among the books he kept with him included lsavasya Upanishad, Rig veda,
Kathopanishad, Koran, Bible, Panini Grammer, Patanjali’s commentary, Manusmriti, Mahabharat
and Ramayana. Apart from these he studied works of Kalidas, Bhavabhuvi Bharthrihari,
Bharavi, Murari Kavi, Tukararn, Rarndas and Ranade. Like this there were 225 books. This
apart nearly 20 Pall books were also referred by him.

Among the English works were inclu-

ded, Aristotle, Kent, Goethe, Newton, Plato, Max Muller, Shakespeare and Socrates.
At the time of his release from the jail Tilak brought with him books totalling about
400.

Soon after his arrival in Poona the manuscripts of 'Gita Rahasya' were not handed over

to Tilak.

There was a stir in the public that the authorities may not return the manuscripts.

On this Tilak replied, "I can write the whole work again,

They may take the written work

but they cannot take away my thoughts. " Such were the many sided qualities of Tilak who
had a distinct place in the evolution of human society.
