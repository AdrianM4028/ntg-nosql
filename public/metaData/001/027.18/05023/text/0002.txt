Dear Friends,

Today’s performance of c0ntemporary theatre is an experiment of new
ideas, new presentations and “new directions”.—theatre often throws up
Challenges from within itself. Direction, script writing, acting, stage design...

are .all fingers of the same hand and the hand is often motivated to define
and redefine its own frontiers. “Women in Black” has grown out of the
' womb of everyday life. From page to stage is always a gruelling process.
Any original script requires a process of fashioning, interpretation, modeling
and remodeling... which in itself are lessons in theatre... expressions of
growth. We are very happy to have you with us and hope you enjoy the
production from all of us at Theatre World.
