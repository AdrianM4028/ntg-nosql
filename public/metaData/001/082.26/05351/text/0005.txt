T H EA T R E GROUP
BO M B A Y
There was an expectant hush from the audience of two hundred as the curtains parted.
They were about to see the first staging of a full-length play in English by a group of
Indians. The play? MACBETH. The time? 1943, July 17. The place? St. Xavier's College,
Bombay. The occasion? The inception of the Theatre Group.

That was/before Independence. The English-speaking theatre in India was struggling to make
itself heard. Today, the Theatre Group is a well-established fact with over 100 productions to
its credit. With audiences numbering in the tens of thousands. With a reputation that extends
beyond Bombay to New Delhi, Calcutta, Ahmedabad, Poona and other parts of India.
Through the years, the Theatre Group's abiding principle has been a sense of
professionalism. Whatever the play, whoever the director, if it is a Theatre Group production
it should bear an unmistakable stamp. This professionalism has nothing to do with money——
nobody in the Group is paid. It springs from a sense of dedication inspired by its founder,
the late Sultan Padarnsee.

Among the highlights of the Group's history :The first tour—CRIM E PASSION EL directed
by E. Alkazi. The first production of a full-length play in Hindi—SHISHON KE KHILONE
adapted and directed by Rifat Sharnirn and Alyque Padamsee. The presentation of SIX
CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR directed by Sylvester da Cunha for the World
Theatre Conference. The presentation of THE C RUCI B LE directed by Alyque Padarnsee
for World Theatre Day. The presentation of EXIT THE KING directed by Pearl Padarnsee
for the XXXVI International Eucharistic Congress. THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER
produced by Deryck Jeffereis.

The Group had mainly been doing plays in English by American and European authors. But
with the start of a Theatre Workshop to stimulate and encourage Indian playwrights, the
Group opened a new chapter in its history. In April 1966, THE WORD, an original play
written by a young Indian, Partap Sharma, was premiered by the Group at the First Bombay
Arts Festival. A few months later came ASYLUM, a play about Bombay life written by Erna
Vatchaghandy. The 'Indo-Anglian Theatre’ had made a start in Bombay.

The Theatre Group firmly believes that if the English-speaking theatre in our country is to
grow, Indian playwrights must be found. Playwrights who, though they may write in Engiish,
speak with an Indian voice.
Nevertheless, the Theatre Group must continue to perform the best of world drama.
Plays
like EOUUS by Peter Shaffer and A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE by Tennessee Willia
ms
have a place in our repertoire. These masterpieces have universal and timeless signif
icance
to audiences everywhere. They also act as an inspirational force for our own playwrights.
These playwrights have contributed over a dozen works in the last 15 years to the
Theatre

Group's production roster. Besides THE WORD and ASYLUM mentioned above. they
include PRINCES by Geive Patel; TUG H LAO by Girish Karnad ; VULTURES by Vijay
Tendulkar; ASHAD KA EK DIN by Mohan Rakesh; A TOUCH OF BRIGHTNESS by
Partap
Sharma; LARINS SAH I B and MIRA by Gurcharan Das; BED ROOM by Zarina Sayani
and

Freny Bhownagary; THE GROWING PAIN by Sylvester da Cunha.

The Theatre Group welcomes the best... from India... from the world.
