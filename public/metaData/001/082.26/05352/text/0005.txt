TH EAT RE GROUP
B O M B AY
There was an expectant hush from the audience of two hundred as the curtains parted.

They were about to see the first staging of a full-length play in English by a group of
Indians. The play? MACBETH. The time? 1943, July 17. The place? St. Xavier’s College,
Bombay. The occasion? The inception of the Theatre Group.

That was 38 years ago. The English-speaking theatre in India was struggling to make itself
heard. Today, the Theatre Group is a well-established fact with over 100 productions to its
credit. With audiences numbering in the tens of thousands. With a reputation that extends
beyond Bombay to New Delhi, Calcutta, Ahrnedabad, Poona and other parts of India.

Through the years, the Theatre Group’s abiding principle has been a sense of
professionalism. Whatever the play, whoever the director, if it is a Theatre Group production

it should bear an unmistakable stamp. This professionalism has nothing to do with money—nobody in the Group is paid. It springs from a sense of dedication inspired by its founder,
the late Sultan Padarnsee.
Among the highlights of the Group's history: The first tour—CRI ME PASSIONEL directed
by E. Alkazi. The first production of a full-length play in Hindi—SHISHON KE KHILONE
adapted and directed by Rifat Shamirn and Alyque Padarnsee, The presentation of SIX
CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR directed by Sylvester da Cunha for the World
Theatre Conference. The presentation of THE CRUCIBLE directed by Alyque Padarnsee
for World Theatre Day. The presentation of EXIT THE KING directed by Pearl Padarnsee

for the XXXVI International Eucharistic Congress. THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER
produced by Deryck Jeffereis. The first large scale musicals GODSPEL directed by
Pearl Padarnsee, and JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR directed by Alyque Padarnsee.
The Group had been doing plays in English by American and European authors. But with
the start of a Theatre Workshop to stimulate and encourage Indian playwrights, the Group
opened a new chapter in its history. In April 1966, THE WORD, an original play written by
a young Indian, Partap Sharma, was premiered by the Group at the First Bombay Arts
Festival. A few months later came ASYLUM, a play about Bombay life written by Erna
Vatchaghandy. The ’Indo-Anglian' Theatre had made a start in Bombay.
The Theatre Group firmly believes that if the English-speaking theatre in our country is to
grow, Indian playwrights must be found. Playwrights who, though they write in English,
speak with an Indian voice.

Nevertheless, the Theatre Group must continue to perform the best of world drama. Plays
like EOUUS by Petter Shaffer and A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE by Tennessee Williams
have a place in our repertoire. These masterpieces have universal and timeless significance
to audiences everywhere. They also act as an inspirational force for our own playwrights.
Indian playwrights have contributed over a dozen works in the last 15 years to the Theatre
Group’s production roster. Besides THE WORD and ASYLUM mentioned above, they
include PR I NCES by Geive Patel; TUGHLAO by Girish Karnad; VULTURES by Vijay
Tendulkar; ASHAD KA EK DIN by Mohan Rakesh; A TOUCH OF BRIGHTNESS by Partap
Sharma; LARINS SAHIB and MIRA by Gurcharan Das; BED ROOM by Zarina Sayani and
Freny Bhownagary; THE GROWING PAIN by Sylvester da Cunha.
In addition, the Theatre Group is endeavouring to develop a Hindi wmg. Recently it has
worked with Majrna, a group of dedicated theatre enthusiasts, to produce PAGAL KHANA,
and adaptation of Marat/Sade by the renowned Urdu writer lsrnat Chugtai.

The Theatre Group welcomes the best . . from India . . from the world. The only criterion
is dramatic excellence.
