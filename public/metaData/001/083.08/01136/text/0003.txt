This year is a year of celebration also for the Kala
Vibhag. The Goa Hindu Association completes

60 years of fruitful existence and its Kala Vibhag
can claim a scintillating record.

Graduating from prize-winning productions at आ-.
ccessive State drama festivals, beginning 1955, the
Kala Vibhag soon plunged into regular productions.
To date, it has staged plays by notable Marathi

playwrights including Vasant ३ Kanetkar, V. V. Shin-’5 '
wadkar, Jaywant Dalvi and others. Audience in
the capital are familiar with classics like Kanetkar' s Raaygadala Jevham Jaag Yete and Shirwad~

kar's Natasamraat. These are among Kala Vibhag
productions which have run to hundreds of shoWs.

The Kala Vibhag has contributed significantly to;
the Marathi musical theatre by presenting both
traditional productions and experimental ones.
Well-known musicians like Jitendra Abhisheki and
Bhaskar Chandavarkar have been closely associat-

ed with these. Kanetkar's Lekuren Udand Jali
pioneered the modern muSical just as Abhidnyana

Shakuntalam pioneers the Natyashastra-oriented
poetic classic.
