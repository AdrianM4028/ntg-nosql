There is no denying that clean surroundings mirror

the character

of an individual and mould our attitude such surroundings radiate joy.

We keep our. homes Sple and Span.

Why not practise the same

inpublic places also ?

On railway platforms, in waiting rooms, in carriages, and in fact,

anywhere where pe0ple gather in large numbers it is of paramount

importance that surroundings are maintained clean.

We on the railways, have launched a cleanliness drive which has
produced handsome results. The railways wear a more presentable
look. We, however, realise much more needs to be done. We shall
relentlessly strive to do better.

to serve you.
