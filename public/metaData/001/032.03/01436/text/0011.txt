A Note by the Playwright on ‘Shahir-di-Nilami’
I believe in writing plays relevant to our times and the problems around us, plays
which illuminate our social and political environment. Such were the themes of “BUH
E
BAll'l-ll DHI", “MAR MITTAN wALE”. "PARLO TON PAIHLE", "UMIDVAR" and of
all my one-act plays.

in “SHAHlR Dl N lLAMl“ l have attempted to tackle the problem of rapid
urbanisation and the slow but certain destruction of the soul of a city. The
pan shop is a point

of convergence of people from all walks of life, a forum of uninhibited discussion, a poor
man‘s club.

The advance of urbanisation squeezes it out of existence.

Newspaper comments on my last production "Umidvar" emphasised its clean
humour, stating that real Punjabi humour is neither crude nor vulgar.

As some Punjabi

plays being staged in the Capital are thriving on coarseness and vulgarity, the Punjabi

Theatre has been sponsoring productions which attempt to elevate the‘lviewers' sense
of appreciation. I hope Punjabi audiences will demand plays which tickle] theirlminds
and not just their ribs. l would like to conclude with a quotatio. rigfrom the famous
Russian director, Meyerhold :
~ ~
~
”I am afraid that we have conditioned our audiences to react with thoughtless

stupid, laughter ——- to laugh at all costs, in fact. Don't you think 980ij
laugh too much in our theatre nowadays ? The moment may come, perhaps
tomorrow. when the audience, corrupted by our desperate efforts to amuse
them, will either guﬁaw or be coldly silent . when they see a subtle, complex.
Intelligent play. That is why l always attack playwright X so passionately. He

may be an able man, but he actively participates in corrupting the audience

with idiolic laughter. That is the only reason why l hate him with all my
heart and soul“.
