I am happy that Mr. Ashok Hans, who has done his post—
graduation in dramatic art from the Punjabi University. Patiala, is
presenting a bold play “Evam Inderjit” by Badal Sarkar at Gaiety
Theatre Simla. I believe that the different opportunities for different
kinds of theatre are so great that there is always the chance to do
something everywhere. There is

never a vacuum. Even where we

cannot do the thing we would most like to do, or imagine we would
most like, we can still do something valuable. I here is always need for
experiment for all manner of new departures and also all manner of
representations of the old and the familiar. I don’t believe that the
different kinds of theatre depend on exculusively different kinds of
audience. The different kinds

of theatre express different kinds of

experience to which all of us can respond at various times. I am of the
opinion that there is always an audience for good theatre, even though
it will often be very, very difficult to ﬁnd it.
I am sure, Mr.

Ashok Hans,

with

all his equipment and

dynamism, with his dedication and commitment to theatre, would be

able to do the most difficult task of ﬁnding the audience for good
theatre in Simla, the cultural capital of the Himachal Pradesh. I wish

every success in his venture.
