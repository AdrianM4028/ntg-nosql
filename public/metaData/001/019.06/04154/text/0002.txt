about “Waiting for Godot ”.....
Waiting for Godot qualiﬁes as one ofthe most

famous works by Samuel Beckett; Noble Prize
Winner. Originally written in French in l 948.
Beckett personally translated the play into English.

Then, the translations in all major languages ofthe
worldfollowed.

Waiting for Godot incorporates many of the
themes and ideas that Beckett had previously
discussed in his other writings. The use of the play
format allowed Beckett to dramatize his ideas more
forcefully than before. and is one ofthe reasons that
theplay is so intense.
Beckett often focused on the idea of “the
suﬂering ofbeing ". Most ofthe play deals with the
fact that Estrogon and Vladimir are waiting for
something to alleviate their boredom. Godot can be
understood as one of the many things in life that
people waitfor.
The play has often been viewed as
fundamentally Existentialist ' in its take on life. The
fact that none ofthe characters retain a clear mental
history means that they are constantly struggling to
prove their existence. Thus the boy who consistenth
fails to remember either of the two protagonists
