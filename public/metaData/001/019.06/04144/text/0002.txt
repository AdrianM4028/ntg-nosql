About 'Fasaad' ...... ..
'Fasaad' is in fact a performance sketch which borrows its lines
from a few short stories written as 'Syah Haashiye' by Saadat Hassan .
Manto in the back drop of partition, Rameshwar Prem's adaptation
of his long poem 'Ajaat Ghar' and Javed Akhtar's audio album 'Tarkash'
(the Quiver). In the sub-text of this sketch lies the experiences that
we have encountered, the dead bodies - we have seen, the blasts we have heard, the shocks - we have felt, the rivers-we have left,
someone - we have lost.

Getting prepared with a few days of rehearsal, the final form of

'Fasaad' is still unknown to me, but it ‘is evolving every hour and
therefore, it shall be unfair to make any statement at this time of
hour.

I

I shall be eagerly waiting to know your response, your suggestions ,
and comments which shall certainly add to the development of
this play.
