(M bout Performance-l, 99
....... ..every time a playscript, .......every time
the recreation of playwright's reality, .... ..every time

. . . . . ..every time

l was fed up. So, the

experimentation started . .... sometimes improvising
from every day life situations (Untitled-l, 95),
performing poetry (Untitled I l | , 96 and Untitled IV,
97), short stories (Untitled-ll, 96), some times
working out performance sketches (Fasaad) and
now Performance-l, 99 with stories by Manto
(Hindustani) and Ved Rahi (Dogri).
l feel it is a search for some kind of theatre
which could be possible in a place like ours, where

hardly any play is being written these days and I
too, am looking for a space.
One may say, it is a beginning of Kahani
' Ka Rangmanch in this land, but l am still trying to
find an expression for myself and beyond myself,
trying to explore new possibilities and the process
‘ is on .... ..
