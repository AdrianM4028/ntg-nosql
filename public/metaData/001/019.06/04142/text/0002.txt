about "PAANDI" ..... ..
PAAND/ is a Dogra community working as loaders in
various warehouses; almost all over India and primarily belonging
to Kandi areas (shivalik dryland foothills) of Bil/awar & Akhnoor
Tehsils of Jammu province. Extremely harsh living conditions
compel the youth to migrate to cities everyday in desperation for
better avenues because of the wrecked farming economy and
scarce employment opportunities back in their villages and they
end up as Paandis. They live in most deplorable conditions in
cities devoid of any basic amenity viz-a-viz sanitation, electricity,
potable water and quality of shelter. The ruthless engines of cities,
after having sucked all their life fuel for years, regurgitates them,
crippled with many diseases, leaving them to die on daily basis.
The present play is just a glimpse of their life, dreams and
struggle which tries to unfold the relationship of the business
class, the establishment and the superficial religious generosity of
the privileged ones on one hand and the allurement of
consumerism in the context of globalisation on the other.
The play starts from such a village, the eldest son Seva
migrates to city in search of a better pastures but ends up
becoming a Paandi in a ware house. To fulfill his dreams, he
borrows some loan from Shah - the godown owner and gets
married. After marriage Seva starts living with his wife Kunti in a
rented room in the old city. The young couple subjected to an
urban lifestyle starts dreaming of making a house of their own in
the city itself and buying a TV, Fridge, Cooler etc. The drunkard

son of Shah - Sonu who searches for sex.coms in cyberspace
eyes Kuan as an easy prey & starts sending her Coca-Cola and
other luxury items.
The case of compensation to another Paandi â€” Angrer
who has broken his leg while working in the godown of Shah is
being hushed up by the nexus of Shah and Labour Inspector in
