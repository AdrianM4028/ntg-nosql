absence of a strong labour union. Side by side the Shah has
created an image of a religious & generous human being by way
of donations for Arnarnath pilgrims and opening of food stalls
(Langer) on every other religious festival. One night when
Paandis are unloading a truck, a heavy sack falls on the back of

Seva breaking his spine.
The play ends with another Seva standing outside the
godown for a job of Paandi ....... . .
The play written during the Young Actors Camp - 01 has
been designed in Epic Theatre Form as coined by Brecht and as
such various elements creating alienation have been used. The
idea is that the spectator should be put in a position where he can
make comparison about everything that influences the ways in
which human beings behave, so that there is an awakening of the

critical consciousness and not merely the catharsis. An effort has
been made to keep the play well clear of the general bourgeois‘
show business.
Since the performance is evolving every hour and
therefore, it shall be unfair to make any statement before its final
perforrnanoe.
'
I shall be eagerly awaiting to know your response, your
suggestions and comments which shall certainly add to the
evolution of thisplay.
