[7n my 50 years’ long career as a theatre worker, I
have never felt the need for a Director’s Note for my
productions. I believe that a production speaks for
itself. Moreover, a comment from director makes the
audience to view a play from his perspective. Such
kind of guided response is neither healthy nor
desirable. It is for you, the audience to comment,
assess and evaluate.
Forgive me, if I fail to understand the contemporary
sloganeering and jugglery that goes on in the name of

theatre. When drama scripts are butchered in the
name of experirnentations, the difference between
music and noise is lost and acting is reduced to
gymnastics - one tends to be disillusioned.
In my fag end of life, I am however happy to see the
dedicated team of Rangyug keeping alive the vrasaf
of good theatre in our state.
If this production of
mine is good, I would
consider myself lucky
indeed. I also wish to
thank my audience, cotheatre workers and
friends to keep my long
theatre sadhana alive.
