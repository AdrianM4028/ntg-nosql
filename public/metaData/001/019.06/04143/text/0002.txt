Theatre as a process is an empowering activity. It
encourages self expression, develops self confidence and
communication skills, and promotes teamwork, co operation,

sharing. It is also-therapeutic," helping“indiQViduals to probe
within, to express and share deep emotional experiences.
Theatre as a medium of communication being
interactive has proved its impact, especially in this country

today. lrnrnediate and direct, circumventing the barriers of
language and education because of its oral and visual

, qualities, it is an effective method of spreading a message,
provoking thought and triggering discussion.

Recognising the power of theatre both as a
process and a medium, we have always valued the
effectiveness of theatre in any movement for change, be it
social, political or personal.

There is a CHANGE and a better understanding of

the present socio—political situations; and this awareness was
evident to me while taking the feedback from family and
friends of the participants.
The present work is a theatre exercise prepared in

a month long camp and hope thatyouwguld appreciate the
enthusiasm and dedication of the participants.
