MOHAN RAKESH (b.1925 - died 4972) A
Scholar of Sanskrit and a prolific writer of almost
all genres of Hindi Literature - fiction, short
stories, criticisms and drama. But he won
international acclaim with his three long plays
“AASHAD KA EK DIN",
“LAHRON
KE
RAJHANS” AND “AADHE ADHURE” which
have been translated and performed not only in
other lndian languages but foreign languages
also. The earlier two are period plays revolving
around historical characters and are earmarked
by a lyrical quality of language. With “AADHE
ADHURE" the language becomes more prosaic
and the realism more striking. His dramatic work
is a milestone in contemporary Hindi literature
with its realistic claracter delineation and portrayal
of struggles of man against man and man against
society.
