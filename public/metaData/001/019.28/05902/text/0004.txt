It gives me immense pleasure to know that

“Theatre M itra" is going to stage Dr. Shanker
Shesh’s play “Barh Ka Pani" on the occasion

of, Dr. B. R. Arnbedkar’s Jayanti on 14th of April
1996 under the direction of Mr.‘ Sanjay Kapil.
Stage play in an art, a source of enjoyment
and a sense of courage among the youth and
removal of social evils by presenting the programme in the national interest by the Theatre is
really appreciable.

I send my best Wishes to the organiser and
participats of various activities and wish the
function a great success.
