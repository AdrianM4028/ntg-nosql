I am very happy to kan that some young
and talented Theatre lovers of Jammu. have

established Theatre M itra in Jammu. Theatre
as a vehicle of creative expression is gaining
popularity in this region and the number of accomplished actors and directors is also increasing.
This is proof that in Jammu the Creative Arts
are being patronised and nurtured. I hope this
trend will continue and serious Theatre dealing

with contemporary topics in modern idiom will
develop faster and enrich the cultural scene of
this State.
