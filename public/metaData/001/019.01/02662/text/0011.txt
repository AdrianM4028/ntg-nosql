ABOUT THE P LAY
The play Andha Yug, based on an episode from the great Sanskrit
epic Mahabharata, tells the story of a family of warrior kings
whose descendents, namely the Kauravas and the Pandavas, wage
a bitter war for power and supremacy. The war represents a
conflict between the principles of Dharama (right) and Adharrna
(wrong).
The playwright, late Dharamvir Bharti, has interpreted this great
war in a new light, giving it a universal meaning against the
backdrop of death and destruction. It is the story of lost souls
caught in the web of their weakness. It is also the story of their
self exploration and quest for enlightenment. It is this very self
questioning wherein the seeds of hope and light are sown for all
mankind.
Andha Yug as a piece of dramatic literature is unique. It is a
rare text that astonishes you with its insight into the history of
human consciousness. In terms of modern dramatic idiom, the

play is imbued with contemporaneity and great density which
comes from the past.
