was proud to have met. It gave him great inspiration and many
ideas about how he would continue his theatrical education back
in Norway. Before he left he wanted to make a pilgrimage to
Kashmir. His journey ended there.

Hans Christian as a person was an ocean of waves. He
was sensitive towards himself and his surroundings, passionately
engaged when he had his heart set at something ,very intuitive
to art, nature, human beings and animals. He was creative and

in possession of a great artistic way of expression .
He acted in, wrote, and directed plays. He composed
music, played both the piano and the guitar, and had a beautiful
voice. He wrote stories and poems. He had a great sense of
h um or .

Hans Christian loved people. Even though he was often
broke, he liked to give away small gifts and was generous to

people around him. He wanted so much to give pleasure to others,

specially those who were close to him. He made everybody feel
important. His belief in the goodness of all human beings was

ﬁrm and , unfortunately, it was this beliefthat ultimately betrayed
him and cost him his life.
