Turgenev was not a didactic writer (which is perhaps why

his place in the theatre has been disputed), and neither his novels
nor his play ring with political argument. There are echoes:
in A MONTH IN THE COUNTRY, Yslaev (the wealthy
landowner, Turgenev’s own type) declares to his friend,
Rakitin, whom he has discovered to be in love with his wife,
Natalia 2— “I’m a simple sort of fellow, but I’ve enough horse
sense to realise that nobody should have the power to ruin
other people’s lives, and that there are times when to insist on

one’s rights would be wicked. And I’m not saying that because
I’ve read it somewhere—I’ve got it out of my own conscience;
freedom—every single soul should be free, that’s always been
my idea.” But principally Turgenev’s signiﬁcance is that he
depicts people—whether they be and remain aristocrats or
peasants, proles or bourgeoisie—as individual human beings,
all in their own way capable of nobility and absurdity in their
living and, notably in A MONTH IN THE COUNTRY, in
their loving.
“Nothing happens”, critics have protested. That remains
to be seen, but one thing is sure: in this play human beings
live. discretely and humanely; and the playwright asks only
that we should let them—on the stage and in the street—so
live.
