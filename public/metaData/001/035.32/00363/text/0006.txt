TURGENEV has been called “a novelist’s novelist” and
A MONTH IN THE COUNTRY “a novelist’s play.” Certainly his inﬂuence upon the novel——through his personal and
literary impact on authors such as George Eliot, Henry

James,

Gustave Flaubert, William Makepeace Thackeray and Harriet
Beecher Stowe in his own lifetime; and on Arnold Bennett,

John Galsworthy, Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf and others
since—well justiﬁes the ﬁrst title.

But does A MONTH IN

THE COUNTRY deserve the implied criticism that it is
the work of a novelist rather than of a playwright? To admit
this would be to suggest that it is in some way a theatrical
curiosity only, and its production therefore a mere sport. We
present it on the stage, however, in the belief that that is where

it truly belongs.

“I am a European,” Turgenev (a Russian) declared, “and
love the banner”. It was precisely during his lifetime

(1818-1883) that this particular banner ﬂuttered most conﬁdently, as the noise of the Napoleonic Wars died away and
before the storm clouds of the First World War had started

to gather. In that interval, Europe’s distinctive contribution
to social and political thinking was made by predominantly
cosmopolitan writers who were watching, meditating upon and
arguing about fundamental changes occurring within the fabric
of its society. The dignity of the individual irrespective of cate-

gory, caste or country; and his consequent right to liberty——
this was the legend that these European intellectuals inscribed

upon the banner, with political consequences for the world
which are still vividly apparent.
