But it should also be noted here that the responsibility of the
producer does not cease with the production of a few translated
versions of foreign plays. It is upto him to begin the development
of modern verse-plays with contemporary social themes.

Since 1924 to 1939 some of the most promising London productions were introduced at small suburban Theatres, such as the
Mercury, Notting Hill, which was opened on the strength of an

unexpected ईर्द. 10,000 which Ashley Dukes, scholar—dramatist and
critic made out of his delightful romance THE MAN WITH A
LOAD OF MISCHIEF. Afterwards a talk with W. B. Yeats and
T. S. Eliot persuaded Ashley Dukes to run the Mercury as a Poet’s
Theatre and Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral was the opening
venture.

The Mercury had only about 150 seats. Yet the Eliot play
completed a run of nine months and was seen by 20,000 people.
Indeed from the standpoint of verse-drama the success of Murder
in the Cathedral was the most signiﬁcant happening in the post-war
years. It encouraged a number of young writers to explore the

possibilities of verse as a medium for the expression of twentieth
century experience in the rthythms of later-day speech.
Thus this little Theatre, the Mercury, was sufﬁcient for all
practical purposes, for the revival of verse—drama in England. In
South Calcutta Sri. Tarun Roy’s Theatre Centre has a theatre hall
of the same type. It has ﬁxed sitting accommodation for 105 persons.
There is enough space in the auditorium for placing another 20
chairs- So the total may come upto 125 seats i. e. only 25 seats less
than what the Mercury could accommodate.
