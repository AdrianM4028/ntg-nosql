first time on the wall of his study.

Three years later an oil painting 0 Swami

Vivekananda at the residence of Dr. Durgapada Ghosh ( Raja Nabakissen Street,
Calcutta ) aroused his ‘Art-consciousness'. From that time, side by side his
studies, he started drawing in pencil. Came in contact with Abanindranath Tagore
in I 927, and was encouraged by that great artist.
In I932, when he graduated from the Calcutta University, he took up painting
seriously. But his family stood in his way, as it wanted him to be a lawyer. Though
became a lawyer in I 937 his great passion for painting stopped him from practicing

law.

Since then like a renegade he pursued with great devotion the work of pain‘

ting without having any training from any teacher or school.

I940—a turning point—brought him a partner in life who encouraged and

inspired him to go ahead, and that possibly brought him success and fame later on.
In that very year he came in close touch of Sri Atul Bose. Four years later he
came in contact with Satish Sinha.
His works were ﬁrst exhibited at the Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta, in

I940

and later on in I946 and ’49. First one-man show was held in Calcutta in I950,
which was followed by two more in the next two years. Then, he participated in
many exhibitions including one in New Delhi in I 953. Recently an exhibition of his
works was sponsored by the lndo~American Society at Calcutta which was
