FOREWORD
THE IDEA in obedience to which THE THEATRE CENTRE
was founded was to establish a NEW THEATRE which should replace the existing one (responsible for Photographic & Phonographic
productions).
THE THEATRE Centre believes that the duty of the Theatre
is to awaken more calmness and more wisdom in mankind by the
inspiration exhaling from its beauty.
The Theatre Centre is not an isolated f'act ; it is part of an
organic whole, other parts of that whole being the School and the
production unit called Mukhosh.
Since the Sisir Era there have been two men working on our
stage, spoiling almost all that is to be called Theatrical Art. These
two men are the Realist and the Machinist. The Realist offers imitation for Life, and the Machinist tricks in place of Marvels.
The Theatre Centre strives for restoring that lost Truth and
Marvel of Life on the stage.
The guiding principle of this centre is Bernard Shaw’ 8 dictum:
‘This would be a very good thing if the theatre took itself seriously as a factory of thought a prompter of conscience an elucidator of social conduct, an armoury against despair and dulness, and‘ a
temple of the Ascent of Man.’
