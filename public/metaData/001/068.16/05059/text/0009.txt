Ghate, a miracle play, all produced at the Theatre Centre Hall.
(Excepting the last two plays the others are also written by Sri. Roy.
The last play has been drarnatised by Tarun Babu from Sri. Dilip
Roy’s Novel of the same name)—l consider his calibre to be
comparable only with that of Peter Brook, the famous West-End
Producer in London. Sri. Roy’s stage—compositions usually have a
pictorial effect hardly attained in any other productions at Calcutta
Theatres. His group has already established its name for perfection
of team—acting.
With such a producer as the head of the show, I think, revival
of poetic plays with contemporary themes may be possible at the
Theatre Centre on the lines of the Mercury Theatre productions.
[his will certainly widen the scope and range of our dramatic
productions.
