{KP‘ﬂA‘i ठे

Set
in Punjab- the land of five rivers,USKI ROTI
is about the eternal lonely waiting Naayika, Balo, for
her beloved and aa timeless journey into the solitude of
her phyche.
The production uses the legendary folk lore and musicviz-excerpts from the Ballads of eternal lovers like Heer—
Ranjha and Sohni-Mahiwal, the folk epic Puran Bhagat,the
humanistic secular love songs of Sufi poets like Baba
Farid,Bulle Shah and Shah Hussein, the vivacious robust
light
hearted
banter
between
boys
and
girls
Boliyan(Bhangra),
the wedding
song
'
Bibi Channan Day
Ohley' Ohley' and Mahiya (Portrayed in Rakesh's original
text),the delightful human philosophical forms of Jindua
and Jugnee with earthy wit and narrated in every day
_idiom-all of which have become a legacy of the people
of Punjab and coveted memories mean %ing down generations
engulfing their own unique ethos, a
times mirroring and
at times running parallel to their lives.
Metaphorically,this
simile
