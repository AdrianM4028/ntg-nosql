Here in India within the last twenty years or so every
city and town has had practically every play of Brecht’s
performed in translations or in adaptations. But the great
favourites are ‘The Mother' ‘The Caucasian Chalk Circle,"
‘The Good Woman of Sezuan. Exception and the Rule,’
Galileo." To my knowledge the ﬁrst ever performance was
an adaptation of Exeception in 1957, by a little known
amateur group in the suburbs of Calcutta. In fact, West
Bengal probably has presented the greatest number of
Brecht's plays, including some of his learning plays. More
recently, Delhi has had a fair share.
The question that naturally comes-why Brecht in India ?
Why of all the dramatists of the West, has Brecht taken root
here, with every language in lndia performing him at least
once, much as Shakespeare was in the 19th Century ?
There are external similarities between Brecht’s and our
folk theatre-the narrative style, music, songs, speaking to
the audience, the half curtain. He touches a chord and

we respond.

Further in a world wracked by conﬂict and

strife, his themes and his approach give us a theatre of our

age. But possibly there is a deeper reason than the above.
With nearly two hundred years of colonial domination, with
Western

naturalistic theatre

imposed

on

us,

now

in

our search for a theatre which is at once modern and contemporary, Brecht probably could show the way.
