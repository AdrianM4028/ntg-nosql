it was A New Way of Looking At life
It was a rewarding experience for me to work with Fritz.
This process of working was quite different from what I

had learnt. Something ﬁne in every student emerged. I
could see every student gaining self conﬁdence while they
fought within themselves to understand the roles they were

playing.

The directors approach

to

explain situations and

characters was not merely useful to enact the character
successfully, but it was a new way of looking at life.
in the process we learnt through Fritz that Brecht’s

‘Alienation' is not alienating ourselves from life, but being
able to hold the strength to go deep into each and every

situation in life, so that we can command them in every way.
A comment of Fritz on acting which was very important
to me ‘Acting comes not from your thinking, but from your

guts. But you should train your guts to be social guts’.
