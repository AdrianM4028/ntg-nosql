Social Imagination
We realised in this production of ‘Galileo' with Prof.

Fritz

Bennewitz, the need for an actor to have ‘social eyes' and ‘social
ears' to observe the happenings around him, to understand the
human situation in the play, and to portray it in such a way that the
audience do not fail to see the social connections in everything done
by the actor on stage. Most of the time in the rehearsals, the director kindled the ‘Social lmagination' of the actors, without which, the

meaning of Brecht's lines can hardly be conveyed. Because for
Brecht "an actor, who knows nothing about politics and who treats
theatre as an ivory tower is not worthy of his place in an adult cornpany : an actor in a community that supports theatre must be as

much involved in the outside world as in his own craft”.

My experience with ‘Life of Galileo’
It is a pleasure that I could be able to understand Brecht to a
certain extent at least during my term at the N80.

बेहूँट का लेखन व पद्धति प्रत्येक रंगकसी को आन्दोलित करती रही है r
लेकिन ब्रष्ट को सही रूप से समझना तभी सम्भव है जब किसी ऐसे

निर्देशक रे साथ काम किया जाए जो बेरुट को सही रूप से समझता सके I इस
प्रस्तुति से यही पाया है ।
