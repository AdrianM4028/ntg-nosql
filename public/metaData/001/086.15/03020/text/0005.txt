DI R E CT 0 8'8 NOTE
The play depicts and deals with-youth—pillars of any nation.

Bluntly we

can divide youth into two as anything else—Bad and Good, knowing Shapespear’s lines—“There is nothing bad nor Good but thinking makes it so,” Along
with different aspects of life and variation of characters, the play shows more of
the bad side and less of the good and its resultant. Of course the resultant is
tragic. Now the question arises who is responsible for such a youth—Education
System? Social Background? Or Both ? Or any thing else? The question
is as complex for me as you are thinking it for yourself and I don’t think play
gives any definite solution but some situations to think.

The point I am deﬁnite about is—the youth serious about some meaningful
purposes has always been hurted by the aimless youth. We appreciate the Youth
surrounded by such bunch of fools and doing creative and meaningful work,
I would like to express my grateful thanks to Mr. Rajiv Manchanda and

Mr. Yashpal Sharma for offering many original insights in the interpretative and

technical aspects of the production and to the team for the collaboration of a
number of talented indviduals inspired by a common purpose.
