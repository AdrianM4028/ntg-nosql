About the play
In Paanch Choron ka Swang Dina Pathak
uses the folk idiom to make a scathing comment
on thieves and thievery of all kinds.

The Nayak and Ranga come across two farm
labourers, a goldsmith, a tailor, a shopkeeper and
a

muneem

who

cheat

others

in

myriad

and

subtle ways. Ultimately the Nayak declares one
of those to be the ‘Super Chor.’

See the play to find out who he is.........
