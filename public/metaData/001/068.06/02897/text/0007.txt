An artist after a life of creations suffers from a sense of dissatisfaction when looks back.

So much done, yet the vast under shadows the canvas of his creations.
ln history of man one can see a stream of cultures that smells of the virgin soil and sings

of the toiling people - Termed 'Folk' anthropologically. This history is now emteroidered with
urban culture with latest sophistications. Amidst and above these and artist is baffled with a
grand question about his self-identity. in seeking this identity he is placed at the centre of the

society which he analysis through his creations. Such analysis begs a question as to the
relation of man to the society i. e, man‘s position in the society, his rights and his duties. Theatre.

although an illusion, deals with these questions. Through its art of illusion theatre unveils the
R e a l ity .
Our present production is ‘Maya'. lt's main character is Jhaksu, a veteran legendary 'Alkap

artist'. Master (Ostad) Jhaksu one day on his way suddenly sings out to his life‘s tune "I am a
visitor to this earth who seeks for 'Man‘ This motto of his, he, as an artist, tried to relised

through his creations. But poverty and distress smashed his this world of artistic illustion.
Jhaksu now being old come back to his paternal profession, i.e. weaving nets and desires to
be sheltered in his family.

But his family refuses to give him a berth there. Abandoned Jhaksu now cries out in
singing :
"Oh! Simuli, *

How i praise thee?
You are garlanded of thorns
and your flowers allthough invite my sight

Are devoid of fragrance and sweetness.“

* Simul - a kind of tree ornamented with thou\rns all its body and its fl0wers are attractively
red — but have no smell and do not look sweet.

The loneliness of our abandoned Jhaksu is the Symbolic for all artistis and this is the
theme of our play 'Maya'.
