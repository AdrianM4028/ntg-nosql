a sensitive critic. He got diploma with honours from the Royal Drawing Society of
London after doing his matric and Hindi Visharad. He entered theatre in I938 when
Parsi theatre was dominating the scene. Through his sensitivity and just by watching

and listening Nautanki he got the knack of it which later culminated into writing of
Nautanki like-Sone Ka Phool,

Agni Byal

and now

the

portions of

Katha

Nandan Ki-which he admits to be his rare achievement, because it was here that he tried
some of the rare compositions of Nautanki. He also
