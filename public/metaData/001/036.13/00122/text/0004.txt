AN ABSORBING PLAY AND PRODUCTION
Manch Madhyam is one of the youngest amateur theatre groups in the capital.

It has been

engaged in stag'ng, in Hindi, some cutstanding dramatic works from other countries with a view to
promote better international understanding.

After its first festival of plays in May 1986, it came out

again this year with two modern Soviet plays with refreshing themes and treatment—A. Volodin's DO TEER
and Alexei Arbuzov's GUZARA ZAMANA, both directed by Sitararn Singh.
DO TE ER was particularly interesting for its suggestive parable-like quality. Revolving around a
suspected murder of a young man In a tribal settlement, it attempts to explore human relations caught into
a entangled web of struggle and intrigue for power and personal jealousies. In spite of some accent on
SUSpense about the identity and motivations of the murderer, the action of the play underlines emotional
conflict and warmth of human concerns and attachments rather than the mu der mystery.

The production, with its reasonably controlled movement and well articulated characterisation,
brought out the underlying human faith in face of conflicting interests. While some of the sequences
tended to become slow or static, the crowd scenes were visually interesting in spite of somewhat cluttered
up acting space on the small Shriram Centre stage. Most of the performers, though freshers lacking in
experience or training, acted with involvement and, frequently, with a lot of vitality. With sustained work
and dedicatic n, the young team can make a place for itself in Delhi’s theatre life.
