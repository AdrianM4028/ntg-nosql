Soviet Theatre in India
ATUL SOOD

Soviet plays are getting popularity day by day on
Vampilov,

Arbuzov,

Indian

Stage.

In

recent days names of

Volodin, Chingiz Aitrnatov and others are not new to the theatre lovers of India.

Anton Chekhov Drama Studio, lVlanch Madhyam, National School of Drama Er other arneatur groups of
the capital

8 other cities are staging the plays of the Soviet authors. National School of Drama has
produced a play by Chingiz Aitmatov "Fujiyama" which introduced the Indian spectators to the new
trend in Soviet play writing.

Anton Chekov Drama Studio has staged at least Six plays of Soviet playwrights in recent past.

Faizal Alkaji had staged Vampilov Er Vinod Kumar translated Er staged Vampilov's "The Elder Son".

But with this development of interest in Soviet plays, there still is more to do—for instance
to date no Soviet theatre troupe has staged a Soviet play on lndian soil.

Scarcity of scripts too is a hinderance for the Indian theatre enthusaists.
Availability of literature on Soviet theatre scene too leaves much to be desired.

Another area yet to be explored is of active collaboration amongst
Indian and Soviet theatre
organisations.

However, the atmosphere for development and exposure of
Soviet theatre in India still, certainly
is optimistic especially in the light of forthcoming festival of USSR in India,
where in several theatre
troupes performences would be worth looking forward to and they
certainly would give a further impetus

to the exchange 01‘ theatre experiences 01‘ tWO great nations of the world who are , historically two great
friends too.
