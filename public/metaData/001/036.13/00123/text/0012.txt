DO TEER
A Stone Age Detective Story

“The men were in a stooping pose, ready for

attack or retreat. Anxiously they watched their
leader who in his turn was watching his-tribesmen,

He already foresaw the misfortunes and disasters

that lay in stare for them.

But his heart

thumped

just as ours does when we anticipate something un-

known and propitious to happen, and it was then that
faith in the future was born, the faith that was to
become a human trait for all time“.
