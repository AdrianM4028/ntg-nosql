‘ABOUT MANCH’
In the first quarter of the year 1986, few like minded people connected

with performing arts,

with the zeal to give a humanatarian dimension to their cause got together and thus the

'MANCH

MADHYAM' a Society for National Er International Performing Art was formed.
Primary objective of the Society being, to promote international understanding, to bring home
the point of hopes, aspirations in other words life, blood and feelings in all the peoples the world over are

basically the same regardless of their nationality or creed, and their emotions are reflected most comprehensively in a medium none other than the theatre.
Thus 'MANCH MADHYAM' took up the idea of taking up the works of playwrights from countries

other than India and present their Hindustani adaptations to illustrate the fact that a different language or
a different culture does not separate one human being from other, that the threat to world peace is a stark
reality.

In May, 1986 the first festival on works of international

playwrights was organised at A lFACS,

which was inaugurated by then Minister for Youth Affairs Ms. Margret Alva and encouraged by the
response, this year too a similar festival of Soviet Plays is being organised at the Sri Ram Centre for
Culture, New Delhi to welcome the Great festival of India 8 the USSR.
'MANCH MADHYAM' intends to carry on this tradition of bringing to the audiences in India the
works from various nations of the world, thus hoping to contribute in

a humble way the cause of world

peace, peaceful coexistence
