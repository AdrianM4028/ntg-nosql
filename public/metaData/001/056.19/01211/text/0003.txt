On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day
ALL INDIA DRAMA FESTIVAL
The sophistication and cultural excellence of a nation are to great
tent reﬂected in the arts which ﬂourish there. This is especially so with
. r gard to the theatrical arts like dance, drama and so on because they cater
z» t a wide cross-section of the citizenry, from intellectual who enjoys going
८7 j
“into the ﬁner aesthetic aspects of a classical dance to the ordinary layman
to whom they are a welcome entertainment that provides a temporary
relief from the 'humdrum monotony of daily life and routine.

But apart from the entertainment value, the capacity of the theatrical
arts to educate and enlighten cannot be doubted. .In fact, the main object
of art is to inculcate a positive outlook in man and expose him to the
ﬁner values of life. And this to .a great measure is accomplished by dance
and drama for in that, the audience through the medium of entertainment
imbibe the message without concious effort on their part. No wonder
then that the greatest minds in the world have regarded the protection
and cultivation of these arts as of primary importance to the progress of
a nation.
SANSKAR BHART’I considers the nurturing and keeping alive of
these art-forms as its fundamental objective and in its short span of life,
has successfully organised dramas, ballets, cultural and historical picture
exhibitions etc. in different parts of the country. As a continuation of this
endeavour, SANSKAR BHARTI is organising an All India level Drama
Festival in the capital on 2|, 22 and 23, January 1983. Famous plays
written in various regional languages will be staged at well known theatres
of Delhi.

It is our good fortune that BHARAT VIKAS PARISHAD has taken
upon itself the responsibility of organising this mammoth festival in the
capital. The enlightened citizens of Delhi are already familiar with
BHARAT VIKAS PARISHAD and its constructive activities in various
parts of the country utilising a judicious intermingling of ancient tradi ३ ions
and modern techniques with a view to create a healthy social outlook and
a good taste in the people.

This festival is expected to be a unique and extraordinary conﬂuence
of plays in different regional languages, enacted by troupes commmg from
