सुकुमार टुडू ( उडीसा' ) Empty space which inspired body language.
Soul who motivates subject. Images come through the subtext of
story and little bit of director’s guidence who unfolded lots of freedom and vision.

भानु उदय गोस्वामी (जम्मू और कशमीर ) जीरो है शुरूआत, और फिर एक
के बाद एक अनगिनत संभावनाओं से साक्षात्कार. It was an enriching experience.

परिमल मिस्वी ( पश्चिम बँगाल) "Kahani Ka Rangmanch", This is
very good exercise for an actor. I enjoyed this work very much.

विद्यावती फूकन ( असम ) First of all reading stories of various tastes
of 100 years and then writing down its synopsis keeping in mind
how to give life to the stories on the stage without changing any
line, is my memorable experience. It is very good exercise for an
actor. Because continuous struggle for doing various characters. And
also with use of minimum properties, minimum costumes and space
compelled actors to create everything by acting. I enjoyed this work
very much.
