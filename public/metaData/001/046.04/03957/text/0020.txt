'Khamosh Adalat Jaari Hai' is a play that has shaped the consciousness of theatre
people in modern India. It strips down the hypocrisies ofthe Indian middle class and
cuts close to the bone. It leaves us no option but to examine ourselves, and take a
view on the cruelties we practice in everyday life.

The NSD is presenting Tendulkar's great play after his sad demise this year and
dedicates this play to the memory of one of the greatest playwrights of
contemporary India
