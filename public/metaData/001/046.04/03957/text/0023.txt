WRITE R’ S NOTE
If there was any formula for how not to write/a '"
then this play was written entirely based on that“
formula, or at least in circumstances conducive t ' "
And that is why, each time something is said in :p’r
of the play I realize that the credit for this does no
belong to me.
The enthusiastic and persevering artistes of
,
Rangayan kept insisting that I complete the play till
two days before the performance. If the resultIs,
anything positive or worthy, the credit must go to

them.

The idea for the plot and characters of this play Cam;
to me through a group that was preparing to portra __
judicial assembly. By listening to their discussions and
perspectives while they were rehearsing, i decided to
take them to a theatrical end. The central character of '
Kurnari Binare was drawn from a poem by Smt.
,

Shirish Pei, that l have made her character recite (in
the first act of the play. While coming up with the
details of this play, i read several plays and books and
saw many films relating to the subject of authentic and
unauthentic, false and true judicial proceedings that
have inspired and influenced me directly and
indirectly. Of these I would like to acknowledge a film
based on a play called We Are No Angels; a play
Dangerous Game by a well-known German
playwright; the last act of Acharya Apte's Dr. Lagoo;
and J .B. Priestley's Time Plays.

The plot and image of life portrayed in this play are
completely and a hundred per cent lndian in spirit.
