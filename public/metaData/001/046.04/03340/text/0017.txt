That Gorky enioys a unique position in the Russian literature, is not a big statement to make.
I shall restrict myself to just the play ”lower Depths”. In 1 986 too, I had chosen this play as a
learning process in ”Realism” for the students, but suddenly while choosing it yet again at the .end of this rnilleniurn, there were certain new depths, that came to the face. The darkness
spreading across this century, the wars that we have witnessed, the class struggles, the
claustrophobia of individuals, breaking and fragmentation, loneliness, the dash of life styles, the
overwhelming magnitude of human suffering and the cry to empathize with pain.
All these characters are present in this play as seed nuclei. Even the deteriorating condition of
women, or the frustration and defeat of a dreamer philosopher, or an expressive artist. Yet there
is a well—thought-of ray of hope that somewhere from the dark recesses of our own minds cellars,
a human being will once again rise above the narrow mid sets, the fanatical politics that dictate
life,- and once again get connected by the human touch, the human quest for life. l find Gorky to
be more of a writer who depicts humanity rather than a torch bearer of any particular ideology.
No even the villains in the play are not portrayed as happy. Are they ?
The third year students have put in a lot of collective effort. I am assured of their involvement.
last time Subhosh Udggota had done the stage design. Keeping the previous stage design in
mind, I have given student designer kanhoiyya the freedom to dabble with it, within the original
limits. I am especially grateful to my colleague Prof. Robin Dos for his ideas, his help, and

support.
I hope, that despite the wars, the partitions, the pain and despair, and the overwhelming sense of
loss, Gorky's play can still be seen as a document of human empathy and hope. If the audience
likes the play it will be our pleasure, if not, the failure will be ours.
