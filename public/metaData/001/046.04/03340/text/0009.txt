T924). In addition, he wrote more memories, personal recollection, and character portrayals in Notes from 0 Dairy (Zapiski iz
nevnika, T924) and one of his best novels, The Artarnonov Bussiness (Dek Artarnonovykh, T925); and he began his tetralogy The

life of Klim Sarngin (Zhizn Klima Samgina, T 927- T 936), an epic of three generations of the Russians intelligentsia.
In T928 Gorky yielded to exhortations to return to celebrate his sixtieth birthday in Russia. The following year he returned
permanently to the Soviet union. ln T932 he became the first president of the newly founded Union of Soviet Writers, and in T 934
he called his fellow writers to unite in an effort to create a literature of "socialist realism,” by which he meant the ioining of a
realistic style with the principles of humanitarian socialism to relflect the new life Russia was trying to build. Stalin however,
regarded socialist realism as requiring ”positive" heroes and positive constructive images of the Soviet Union in literature and art.
Thus unwittingly, Gorky, one of the most humane of men, has long been identified as the father of socialist realism.
There are two theories regarding Gorky's death near Moscow on June T8, T936. One holds that he died naturally from turer’culosis;
the other, that his death had been ordered by Stalin and blamed on a Trotskyite plot. Yogoda, Stalin's secret police chief during the
great purges of T 936-T 938 confessed” at his own trial in T938 to having ordered Gorky's death, but there is no real evidence to
substantiate his allegations.

his works
The naturalisrn af Gorky was described by Chekhov as ”a destroyer bound to destory everything that deserved destruction.”
Paradoxically,, he was also something of a romantic, cherishing a strong faith in the holiness of man. This excessive sympathy for
the human condition caused him to stay his hand when he might have been expected to deliver his severest blows, and here, in a
sense, he betrayed his dramatic art. He allowed his characters impossible dreams of a beautiful life with which to sustain themselves.
His plays are bitter, but the bitterness in mitigated by the compassion emanating from their creator, who in fact criticzed his
contemporary, Chekhov, for being too hard on his pitiable characters.
