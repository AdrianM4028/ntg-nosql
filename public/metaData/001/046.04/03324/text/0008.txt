Ef'hejourney is quickly dealt with and the Birds arrive at the court of the Simorgh. And they/ind
that the Simorgh they have sought is none other than themselves. Only thirty (Si) hirds (morgh) are left
at the end of the way. 74nd the SQWOCIiGW meet the simorgh, and the goal of their quest.
{The poem is full of sufi imagery. many of the stories at first reading seem obscure, which is

intentional. So that the reader looks at the prohlem in an unfamiliar way, and logic is often delihrately
ﬂouted so that we are teased or goaded- rather than logically led, into understandings. Eﬁvo themes in
particular are difused throughout almost the entire poem—the necessity of destroying the self and the

importance ofpassionate love. ahe two are connected, the self is seen as an entity dependent on pride
and reputation; there can he no progress until the pilgrim is indifferent to both, and to make him
indifferent, the commonest way is the experiecne of ovewhelming love.

“ CIf you are possessed of discernment Joined with knowledge, seek the company of the

dervishes and Become one with them. ELove for the deryishes is the key which opens the door
into paradise. 5T'he dervish's garment is nothing But a patched rohe, and he is not led astray 6y
earthly desires and passions”
