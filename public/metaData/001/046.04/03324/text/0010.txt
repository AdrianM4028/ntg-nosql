it will be possible in two weeks, after completing the rehearsals, after meeting with audience, after
opening the show. (Before that we have toﬁnd on t new skin for old wisdom so, now we areJ'ust working,
searching, checking. (Every day brings new discoveries and only one thing seems to be firm and sure
