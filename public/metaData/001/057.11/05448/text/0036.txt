intelligence having failed, the king appealed to Vishnu Sharma, a scholar of repute,
to guide his sons. He taught the king’s
sons the Panchatantra, the ﬁve guiding
principles of intelligent living, through
fables about the mouse, the turtle, the deer

and the crow—all regarded as very sensible
creatures.

The ﬁrst fable of the ballet draws the
moral: unity is strength. A hungry group
of doves is caught in a hunter’s net in
spite of the friendly warning of the wise
crow, Laghupatnak, but with their united
eﬁort they ﬂy away with the snare. Next
we see them being set free by the mouse
Hiranyak, a friend of the doves, who cuts

the snare. The crow wishes to become a
friend of the mouse in spite of the age-old

foundation of the Little Ballet Troupe with
the aim of fostering healthy traditions,
both classical and folk, in theatre arts,
especially in dance, music and decor, and

staging ballets, dance-dramas and training

young artistes.
The troupe which started with about
half a dozen persons soon attracted many
talented and enthusiastic artistes.
The troupe does not only do its own
choreography and compose its own music
but also prepares all the masks and costumes for the ballet including the decor.
Trained by Shanti Bardhan, the troupe
has two of his ballets in its repertoire,

Panchatantra and Ramayana.

hostility between their species and through
his sincerity wins the conﬁdence of the
mouse. This friendship thrives through
many vicissitudes and their circle expands
and the turtle and the deer join the happy
band and the ballet ends with the moral:
If beasts enjoy so great a prize
Offriendshz'p, why should wonder rise
In men who are so wise ?
This ballet has been produced and
presented by the Little Ballet Troupe of
Bombay. It was on January 20, I952.
