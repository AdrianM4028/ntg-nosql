Mughals, when it was considered a mere
entertainment, more stress was laid on

the technical aSpect of the dance. The
skill of the dancer in displaying the fast
and intricate foot movements with compliâ€”
cated time-measures became the criterion
of the performance. The Radha-Krisnna
episodes were danced with more abandon
an d sensuality.

During the eighteenth century Shri
Thakur Prasad of Lucknow and Shri
Janaki Prasad of Jaipur introduced a
revived form of the ancient Kai/wk in
which the technique based on the Natya
Shastra and Ab/zz'naya Darpana was in H uen~
ced by the romantic fervour of the Mughal
Court. The Rajahs and Nawabs patronised those exponents and their descendents who carried on the tradition.

A Kat/1a}? performance consists of
Ganesh Vandana (invocation), Amad (com-

mencement of dance, introduction of rhythrnic syllables) Tukras. Parans (intricate
rhythmic patterns) and Tatkar (foot-work).
These items form the pure dance (er'tla)
aspect of the programme while Cat and
Cat b/Iav, (l) rical dance sequences rendering episodes from the life of Krishna) form
the er'I-l'a aspect.

The programme ends

with Abhinayam, interpretation through
gestures and eXpressions of the various
moods contained in a Song.
