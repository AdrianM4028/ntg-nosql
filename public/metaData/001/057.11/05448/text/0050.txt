Veen a
hollowed Wood about two feet in length.
It has three or four strings, one of which
is of brass an ] the rest of gut. It is played
by a haw. There is a peculiarity about
its playing in as much as the ﬁngers are
not kept upon the strings in ordcr to
produce notes, but against their sides.
This facilitates the production of some of
the peculiar elalnrations of Indian music,
known as ggzmaka. The Sarangi has a
sweet mellow sound and possesses a consis
derably large range and tonal beauty.

I'eena is the oldest and most outstanding string instrument of India. References
to it are found in earliest mythological and
other Sanskrit works and it is associated
with the Indian goddess of learning,
Saraswati. Though not much in use now
in the North, it is

the

South. It is certainly suited very eminently
for the most profound and characteristic
rendering of Indian music.
The construction of Veena is a complicated process. It consists of a large hollow
howl either of jack or blackwood, on which
the bridge is placed. It has seven strings
out of which four are main, the other three

are meant for providing a sort of drone to
the player. It is played by a plectrum or

even by ﬁnger-nails

and

four

fingers

are used. The North Indian Veena is
different. It has two gourds and is held

upright.
