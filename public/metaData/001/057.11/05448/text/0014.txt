The ()raons hail from the highlands of
Western Ranchi in Bihar. A tribal people,
thev are noted for their rich repertoire of

seasonal dances. The ‘71'tz'a, one of their
most exquisite dances, is performed at the
advent of winter after the monsoon clouds
have drifted away leaving the sky a Clear
blue. The ﬁelds, rich golden, ready for
the harvest, sway to the breath of the
gentle breeze. There is romance in the
very air and the sentiment of love is expresSed through this joyous dance.
Dressed in traditional costumes of red,

green and yellow, and wearing brass and
silver ornaments, young boys and girls
participate in this dance which commences
with the boys forming a bow-likesemicircle, and the girls forming a straight line
signifying an arrow. As the dance progresses, the girls, with arms interlocked,

form a circle round the musicians in the.
Centre. The instruments used are, the
nugara, mandar, mailjiru and jlzal. The
boys form an outer circle, keeping time to
the beat of the drum. The dancers move
backwards and

forwards, at intervals sit-

ting down and clapping hands in unison.
