Classical
rnusic

music, like music anywhere in the world, is intimately connected with the social and cultural evolution of
our people. It has, naturally, emerged out of the earliest forms
of simple religious and folk music and was, in its initial stages,
an integral part of the collective living of the community.
Later on, with the growing complexity of the cultural pattern of
the country, it has been elaborated and various melodies and
styles have been incorporated into a codiﬁed pattern to form
the sophisticated and classical style. All through the course of
its development, our classical music has retained its basic

modal structure which has taken on ever new forms and added
new grace and reﬁnement without moving in the direction of
harmony.

In our system of music an octave is divided into 22 unequal
intervals called slzrutz's and a combination of a certain number of
them, corresponding to deﬁnite expressions, forms a mode or a
raga. A raga has at least ﬁve and at the most twelve notes. This
naturally offers possibilities of a limitless number of ragas, with
difference in the use of notes in ascending or descending scales
and with variation in emphasis or preponderance of certain notes.
The ragas are said to correspond to various moods and vary
with different hours of the day and changing
ons.

A performance of our classical music whether vocal or
instrumental, consists of an elaboration of a raga which is
impromptu. This is, naturally, a result of continuous practice
and mastery over the development of the modes. Thus the
composer and

singer

or player are one and the same person.

The exposition of classical music starts with alapa which
is slow, gradually expressing and elaborating the relation and
signiﬁcance of each note used in that particular mode. Its
expression is noble and deep. The alapa is followed by a song
or gata (instrumental composition) in a slow tempo to the
accompaniment

of

the

Pakhawaj,

a

percussion

instrument.
