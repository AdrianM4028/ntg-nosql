The movement for children’s theatre

The Children’s Little Theatre came
into existence recently when a band of
selfless enthusiasts ready to provide music,
colour and rhythm to the thousands of
children in the country collected together.
It provides a cultural and recreational
centre for children upto the age of twelve.
lt publishes rhymes and plays in various
languages for kindergarten children; assists
schools by training the teachers in the production of rhymes, plays, etc., and also

started only a few years ago. But during
this short period it has not only succeeded
in creating great enthusiasm for the work,

but it has also achieved a standard in its
productions. At the same time, the
movement is spreading to various new
cities and areas and it is hoped that in
course of time it will provide the muchneeded outlet for the tremendous creative
energy of the millions of young people of
this country.
