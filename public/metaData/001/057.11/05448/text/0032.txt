One of our

foremost

pioneers in this ﬁeld, started his earliest experiments. 'I hns he

hurdle in the way of creating appropriate music for the Indian
ballet, which would be able to express the desired idea and vet

composers have, for this purpose utilised human voice and song,
besides extensive ue of a large \‘Lriety of our drums and other
Iolk and traditional instruments.
