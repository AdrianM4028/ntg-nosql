kavad I attam
Kaoadz’al‘tam is a well-known folk
dance of South India performed by the
devotees of Lord Muruga as an offering
to him. The Kavadz', an arched piece of
Wood with cloth work and the short
wooden base-rod held on the neck, is
swung round to the dance movements.
Dancers display amazing feats of skill by
balancing and moving the Kavadi on all
parts of the body and in various attitudes
and poses without any support of the
hands. The music consists of typical
folk tunes.
The orchestra consists of
Nagaswaram (wind instrument),

Pambai

and Thamku (percussion instruments).
