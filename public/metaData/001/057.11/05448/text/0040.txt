commercial venture, to provide entertainment to the middleclasses. Though not of a very high artistic quality,.1ts productions kept alive interest in drama. The rise of nationalism
reawakened interest in our cultural traditions and led to a
renaissance in our theatre arts. In the beginning this reawakening was inevitably influenced by the West. There was greater
leaning towards naturalistic presentations together with efforts
at improved stage technique and selection of modern themes.
But gradually our theatre moved on towards genumely
national forms and expressions.
This development has produced a dynamic theatre in Bengal
in which every contemporary trend ﬁnds expression. Its wellequipped theatres are a distinct advantage, but much more signiﬁcant is the abundance of talent and taste. A large number
of amateur and non-professional groups are conducting new
experiments to try and synthesise modern elements and folk
techniques.
The contemporary Maharashtrian theatre lays greater emphasis on sociological drama. In Gujerat, current plays focus
attention on social problems and show a tendency to return to
the living experience of the common people.
In Hindi and Urdu, also, dramatic activity has been on the
increase. A large number of plays have been written, many of
which concern themselves with the concept of democracy and

the notion of social struggle, apart from themes from our
historical past.
The ancient dramatic traditions are still deeply entrenched
in the South. Nor is it desirable to entirely dislodge them.

modern techniques.
Of late, folk plays have also attracted some attention. Apart
from imaginative treatment of theme, concrete yet extremely
dramatic quality of expression, the folk plays are deeply rooted
in the life and tradition of our people. A closer study of these
plays is bound to inﬂuence greatly our dramatic technique and
practice.
Thus a modern Indian theatre with a national identity of
its own is gradually emerging and efforts are being made in
several quarters to revitalise our ancient classical and folk heritage, which is equally rich in the theory and the practice of
drama, and to direct our energies in such a manner as to ensure
for the Indian theatre the same exalted status as it had in the
