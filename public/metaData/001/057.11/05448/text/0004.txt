Year. In North India, businessmen open new account books as
they start their new ﬁnancial year on th1s day.
Why is this festival celebrated P There are many legends
connected with it, most of which centre round the triumph of
good over evil.

Some regard it as a day devoted to the worship of Lakshmi,
the goddess of wealth. Any financial gains on this day are
considered auspicious. Old and young try their luck at games
of chance like cards.
Others believe that during this season their ancestors come
down to earth for a short sojourn. The Deepavalz' lamps are put
up to light their way from the ‘other world’ to this.
Again, some celebrate the festival as the day of Rama’s Coronation after the destruction of the evil demon king, Ravana. Rama
is associated in Indian mythology with all that is good and noble
and honourable. His reign called ‘Rama-Rajya’ is believed to
have ushered in an era of peace, plenty and happiness for the
high and low alike, and men still hope for a return of that age.
In Southern India, Deepavali is called Naraka Chaturdasi, a
day dedicated to the memory of Narakasura, another demon
king. His destroyer, Vishnu, is believed to have granted his
request that he would be remembered and honoured on the day
he was vanquished. Another similar legend associated with the
same day, is the story of Bali Raja who was sent to the nether
regions by Vishnu appearing in his incarnation of Vamana.
The Vaman Avatar is the ﬁfth of the ten incarnations of God,
who is said to have come down to the earth to destroy evil, thus
associating Deepavali with the triumph of good over evil.

Probably, the sense of joy and deliverance so natural during
the Deepavalz' has also its basis in nature and the cycle of
seasons. The Deepavalz' marks the end of the period of dark
clouds and rains.

Whatever its origin, it is a season of peace and friendship, of
joy and festivity.
