The renaissance, ushered in by Independence, has revealed
a bewildering and bewitching variety and richness of our folk
dances preserved in peasant huts and tribal hamlets. They are
eloquent testimony to the greatness of our cultural heritage and

The people inhabiting the Himalayan regions, like the
Himachal Pradesh, Kurnaon, etc., are known for the serenity and

charming ease in their dances which are accompanied by haunting melodies. These dances seem to convey the ethereal beauty
of the lofty heights of the Himalayas.
The tribals of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar or Orissa perform
dances to propitiate their patron deity Shakti, the Primal Energy.
In their vigorous dances they weave beautiful choreographic
patterns which suggest the swaying of the Sal trees with their
fragrant blossoms, the roaring waves in the sea or the bright
sunshine after the dull rainy season. The festival of youth is
a unique feature of the tribals.
The Nag-as of the North-east border perform the war dances
to celebrate a victorious hunt.
The Rad: dances of Rajasthan, Gujerat and

Saurashtra deal

with episodes from the life of Shri Krishna. The Kummi and
Kolattam of the South are inspired by similar legends. There
are other types of dances connected with temple festivals in
different regions like Raasdhari in Uttar Pradesh, Kara/eamatiam

in Tamilnad, Vela/2111i and Otlmit/m/la/ in Kerala and the Dandari

dance of the Raj Gonds of Hyderabad.
The character of folk dancing varies with the climate and

of these dances, there are many features common to allâ€”the
joy in rhythm, the pulse-beat of the drum, the cymbal and
the clapper, the swaying of the body and the rhythmic stepping
