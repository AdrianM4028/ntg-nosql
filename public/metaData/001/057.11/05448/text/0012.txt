ﬂKarma dancers

ka r m a
Karma is a dance popular with the

Baigas, a tribal people of Madhya Pradesh.
They work on the land and in the forests.
The Karma dances are usually performed
during the festivals of Dusse/Ira, Dee’pa"ca/1' and the New Year.
Picturesquely dressed groups of men
and women perform the dance with the
instrumentalists in the centre of the group.
The Karma is danced with gay abandon
and is distinctive for its intricate foot-work
and quick movements. The Baigas use
the T/zz'ski, a musical instrument made of

wood and bamboo, to keep time. It gives
a short sharp noise like the clapping with
hands. Festive Karma songs accompany
the dance.
