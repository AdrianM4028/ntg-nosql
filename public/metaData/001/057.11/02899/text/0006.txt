Ajab Dash
CA LC UTTA P U P P E T
THEATRE, CALC UTTA
Director: Suresh Dutta

Synopsis
There was a land where two
communities, one led by
Daridin and the other by
Tikishvar, lived peacefully.
Trouble began when the
king, Gumpharaj, imposed a
new tax on the people. There
were protests and even riots
when Tikishwar was
arrested. However the
daughter of Tikishwar and
the son of Daridin, Shikha
and Nuru, were friends, and
they could not understand
why their fathers quarrelled.
Finally they took the daring
step of chopping off the
‘Dari’ (beard) and the ‘Tiki’
(tuft of hair on the head) of
their respective fathers one
night. There was a great
deal of commotion over this
but when it was discovered
that the children had done it
out of fear for their fathers’
enmity and that the king was
responsible for all the
trouble, the two leaders
made peace again.

and its solution. Communal
disturbances are created by
our rulers to gain ever more
power. The role of the two
children in the drama, Nuru
and Shikha, attracted me
very much. If children are
properly educated, they can
remove enmity between
different communities.
