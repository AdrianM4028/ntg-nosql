The puppet theatre in India has a long and rich past. It has
existed in India for at least 1500 years according to
scholars.

Shadow, string, rod and glove puppets are all found in
different parts of the country. Handed down from
generation to generation, some forms of puppetry have
sustained themselves in changing circumstances, while
some others are not in a viable condition today. In such
cases, the puppeteers have also been practising music,
wood-carving, decorative crafts, etc, to supplement their
earnings from puppetry.

Over the past few years Sangeet Natak Akademi has
organized a series of festivals in various regions focusing
on particular techniques or forms of puppetry. At these
events traditional puppeteers have demonstrated their
skills through performances and have interacted with each
other in workshops, exchanging ideas for the development
of their art. The present state of puppetry has received due
attention in the deliberations. These festivals have been
held in Udaipur, Guwahati, Udupi, Dharmastha/ and
Diamond Harbour.
This concluding festival in the series focuses on
contemporary or non-traditional puppetry, which has taken
great strides in India over the past few decades. Many
gifted individuals have contributed to the art with their
special styles of performance and have given new thought
to the use of materials and themes. Gradual/y, Indian
audiences are coming round to the view that puppet
theatre is a wonderful form of entertainment and
education.
The puppeteer in modern times faces many
challenges, not the least from the mass media. But as the
work in this festival will show, there are ways round the
difficulties and a special niche for puppet theatre amid the
gamut of the arts. Change is the key to its survival, and a
capacity for new themes in a changing world.
