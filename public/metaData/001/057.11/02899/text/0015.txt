adversary. In the midst of
the dance one partner sticks
its bill in the hunter’s trap. All
its efforts to free itself are in
vain. The hunter claims his
quarry and goes for his next
kill.
As darkness descends,
the spouse of the trapped
crane stands in solitude
watched by the setting sun.
Now the greedy prowler
returns with a net. The
lonesome spouse springs
into action: she tears apart
the trap in anger and sends
it sprawling into the deep.

Director’s Note

Using the medium of
modern puppet theatre, the
puppeteers here try to create
an understandable visual
language. The dramatization
of the story is done by nonverbal means, by precise
movements of the puppets,
by playing with form and
colour, and by loud and soft
sound effects.
