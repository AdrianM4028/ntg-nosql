Gandhi through movements.

A play within a play
begins. A macabre circus
with two clowns, featureless
at first and later dark and
light; the lighter one gets the
better of the darker one.

A train which is going to
be our symbol through the
play enters the stage. (1993
was a hundred years since
Gandhi was thrown out of a
train in South Africa because
of his colour.)

Gandhi tries to help the
darker puppet but in the
bargain a large sola topee,
a hat representing British
authority, beats the dark
clown, however only
threatening Gandhi.

A guard — a large
masked figure representing
the white authority — stops
the train and throws out the
little figure of Gandhi. The
little figure is faceless as till
now he was a barrister
travelling in South Africa.

During his lifetime,
Gandhi did a lot of writing.
The puppet goes through the
motions of writing and the
actors run into the audience
and deliver the little sayings
and quotations written by
Gandhi.

The little figure is given
life and putting on a mask
becomes Mahatma Gandhi

A chess game between
a skull and army tank
representing war.

Masked characters with

Establishing the theme, the
Sutradhar or narrator — in
this case a dancer — tells
us about the man Mahatma

homespun Khadi discarding
his Western attire.
