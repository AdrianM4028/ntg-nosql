Synopsis

This story takes place in a
village beside a river where,
for the villagers, life was
bliss till Kaalia came along.
From then on, he became
the incarnation of the God of
Destruction for the poor
villagers.
Who would save the
villagers?
A little boy.
But how? . . .

Physical strength is not
a necessity for life. The
difficulties one faces can be
solved by one’s will-power
and brains.
