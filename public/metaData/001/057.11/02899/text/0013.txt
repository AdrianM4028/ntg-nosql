Director: Ratnamala Nori

Synopses

In Balance Sheet we meet
Krantishree, a reputed
feminist writer and social
activist fighting for the cause
of women. But while on one
hand she wants to get her
daughter married without
any dowry, on the other she
demands a large dowry for
her son, claiming it is only
the expenses she has
incurred on her son’s
upbringing. The bride’s
mother Sita and her friend
Janaki decide to expose
Krantishree’s
doubledealing. They successfully
hatch a plot to teach a
lesson to the hypocritical
Krantishree.

The Well is a short play
on national integration.

Director’s Note

The dowry system has
existed in our society since
ancient times. The abuses of
the system are still very
evident in sociey. Many
innocent girls become
victims of this system
perpetuated by everincreasing greed on the part
of the bridegroom’s parents.
Even the educated sections
of society suffer from the
malaise. Finding a way to
eradicate this system is the
main thematic concern of
Balance Sheet, a short play
which tackles the problem
humorously. It is performed
with rod puppets, while
The Well employs glove

pu ppets .
