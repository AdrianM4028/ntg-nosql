Gautami, the matron of the Aérama.

Learning of S‘akuntala’s condition she has come

to sprinkle holy water on her and ask her to return to the hermltage.
While Dusyanta still lingers about in the forest clearing, he hears the hermits call

him for protection of their evening rites.

He goes to ward off the demons.

Scene 4: The Hermitage

The Gandharva marriage between Dusyanta and Sakuntala has already been performed. The companions, Anasﬁya and Priyamvada are out picking ﬂowers. Durvasa
an irascible hermit, calls as a guest and asks to be received. Lost in thoughts of D usyanta,

Sakuntala ignores his call, whereupon he pronounces a curse on her. The burden of
the curse is that the one she is thinking of will forget her.
In distress,» Priyamvada runs off to appease the sage and begs that he withdraw
the curse. Durvasa concedes only to the extent of saying that the curse of t'orgetfulness
W1ll cease at the Sight of an ornament given for remembrance.
The sage Kasyapa blesses S‘akuntala on her departure to her husband‘s home. He
asks sarngarava and two other ascetics to accompany her to the court. Sakuntala bids

a sad farewell to the trees, the birds and the beasts of the hermitage as well as to her
companions.

Gautami accompanies Sakuntala.

Scene 5: Dusyanta’s Court

The King is in a melancholy mood.

The Vidﬁsaka attends on him. The Chamber-

lain announces the arrival of hermits and ladies from Kanva’s Aérama. The King
orders that the Preceptor should receive them and bring them to him.
They are soon ushered into his presence, but Dusyanta now has no recollection of
,
Sakuntala and their marriage. There are heated exchanges between him and the hermits.
S‘akuntala in a ﬁnal effort to arouse his memory is about to show him the ring he had
given her when she discovers to her horror that itis not on her ﬁnger. Gautami suggests
that it may have fallen into a river on the way. The King however regards the whole
affair as a fraud. Sakuntala after a violent ﬁt of anger breaks down.
