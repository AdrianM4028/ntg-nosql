Exchange of Cultural Troupes is the
need of the hour and such exchanges provide an opportunity to
move each other and share the ideas
and experiences. Such exchanges
help in better understanding and
learning of culture for the artistes in
particular and audience in general .

Theatre is a combined form of
literature, Music, Dance, Drama and
visual arts can be a representative
of the ongoing cultural, literary and
artistic development in a particular
region. The play “Mallika” which is
being staged in the State of Harayana
will certainly be a new experience for
the Art Lovers of Harayana and will
present the artistic traditions of
Jammu & Kashmir.
We hope that this visit of our
state troupe to Harayana will further
strengthen the bonds of love and
understanding between the people of
Harayana and our state.
