are in the cast? How
long is it? How complicated is the set, and
how many scene changes are there?
Well for once, we had
no great problem with
the choice of play: our
one and only aim on
this occasion is to entertain and to entertain
as large a group of the
English-speaking cornrnunity as possible. But
which of the many entertaining plays would
Steve Wassell with Back-stage Carpenters
we do?
Again the
choice was not too difficult as we had so enjoyed “The Secretary Bird" when—
we had read it. It seemed to fit the bill entirely. A two-act play with only one
set and only five characters; a comedy, to boot; and yet, so utterly credible, that
it is not just another trite drawing room trifle, nor is it avantgarde, nor risque,
but it is modern and delightfully funny, and also has a wealth of meaning. My
great hope is that you will be amused and entertained by it. Anyway we have
done our best, and now we give it to you.
Remember, please, that
we are an amateur
company of busy people
