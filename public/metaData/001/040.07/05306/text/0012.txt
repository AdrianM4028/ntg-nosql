Director’s Note
‘The Private Life of the Master Race’ or ‘Aatank Ke Saye’ written in the mid-thirties,
deals with the ‘fear and misery" inflicted on innocent people in the wake of Hitler’s
Nazi armies overrunning Europe. However, Brecht does not focus on the political
events leading to the rise of Nazi domination over Europe, rather this information is
incapsulated in the form of songs which intersperse the scenes.
The 17 scenes which constitute the play (of which we have selected 7) are
conceived of as unconnected vignettes from the daily life of a cross-section of the
people. Brecht foregrounds this daily life and sets out to examine, in terse and
simple terms, the changing relationship between human beings under severe
pressure. This pressure is seen less as a violent aggression of any physical kind this is not the story of bloody murders, tortures within concentration camps or
nightly visits by the Gestapo, but is a play located within the private homes of the
seemingly complacent middle-classes - in the bazaars, the courtrooms, the
prisons, during quiet Sunday lunches, while standing in a queue for ration or in a
bedroom. On the surface daily life continues normally, as it does even in times of
war. Brecht then proceeds to unearth what lies beneath this surface normalcy and
in each scene he shows how the fabric of daily existence is being ripped apart at
the seams by the atmosphere of terror which fills the air with unspoken demands
and pressures. In the process we see the characters submitting to fear and, by
foregoing their rationality, finally becoming zombies or puppets who can easily be
manipulated.
Human relationships undergo a change in the process. So we see that the
relationship between neighbours is no longer ‘neighbourly’. The relationship
between husband and wife, parents and children, between honest personal
convictions and the demands of a Fascist state - all these relationships become
strained and change their complexion. Fear and suspicion of each other, a lack of
trust, dwindling faith in human ideals - a basic morality which binds people together
and allows them to behave with dignity and honesty - are shown to be lost - not just
lost, systematically eradicated.

ln ‘Nyaya Ki Taalash’ we see how the Judge submits to political pressure, in ‘Ghar
