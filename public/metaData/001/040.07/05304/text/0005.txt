ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Our most grateful thanks are due to Dr. Kapila
Vatsyayan who

has throughout been a

source

of

inspiration for us and has guided us in several import-

ant aspects of the exhibition.

We are also indebted

to her for having graciously consented to open the
Exhibition.

We would also wish to thank the Archaeological

Survey of India. the Sangeet Natak Akademi and the
National Museum for having provided us with valuable
material for the exhibition and to Srnt. Debala Mitra,

Shri H. Sarkar, Shri B. N. Pandey, Shri M. L. Varadpande for their keen interest and

assistance.

The

devotion of Miss Tripurari Sharma has been exemplary.
Finally, without the sincere dedication of Shri T. L.

Sharma and

Shri Dilip Chand the setting up of the

exhibition would not have been possible.
