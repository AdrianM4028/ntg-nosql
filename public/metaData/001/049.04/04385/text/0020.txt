ABOUT TH E NOVEL
The grain of truth in Vinod Kurnar Shukla’s early
works had forced the literary aware to take notice of
him, and finally, “Naukar Ki Kameez" that followed,
has not only made his contributions difficult to
ignore, but conversely one has to accept that it is
one of those rare modern works of art which can
withstand the acid test of time. “Khilega to Dekhenge"
had suggested that he was not dabbling in fiction just
to prove the age-old criteria that “a poets real mettle
lay in writing fiction." Now his third novel “Deewar

incomplete, without giving due credit to his
contributions. Not only is this way different from his
earlier works but going through it one comes to
know how inevitable it is to make the meaning of his
earlier works complete. Presently though one can
safely call it a composite, free flowing trilogy, which
can any day transform to a tetralogy or a pentalogy.

love that they enhance the sensibilities of the reader.
They are not extraneous episodes added to titilate or
“sell" the work, but incidents that are as natural as
the presence of "nature" in his work. They are so
central to the work that without them the work
would have seemed unconvincing. The surprise

though is in the fact that his poems have never
displayed such physicality.

By his work Vinod Kumar Shukla has not only
managed to squelch the petty debates about the
future of the Indian novel, he has broadend the limits
to which a novel can make an impact. He manages
to effortlessly do so, by maintaining a rajorsharp

between convention 8 experiment, prase 8 poetry,
