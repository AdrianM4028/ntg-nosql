is one of Egypt's outstanding contemporary

wri ers, the generation of Naguib Mahfouz, Youssef El-Sebai and
Yehia Kakki. He has written in many literary genres especially
the novel, the play, the literature of confession or
autobiography and the literary essay. He has been trying lately
to evolve a new form of "dramatic essay", an essay which depends
on dialogue.
से-ब-रारा-त-श-दु interests have embraced a wide range of human problems,
extending from the relationships of love, marriage and
friendship, to the problemiof politics and philosophy. His

most outstanding trait is his sense of humour and SiMpliciEZu.
His style is elegant, lucid and has a contemporary flavour.

His major work of fiction is "The Return of the Soul". Among
his important contributions to the literature of confession

and autobiography are ”i Sparrow from the East" and
"Journal of a Country Magistrate". Two of his outstanding
plays are "PeOple of the Cavern" and "Scheherazade". He has
used ancient Pharaonic myths and religious tales to great
advantage in formulating the themes of some of his works.
