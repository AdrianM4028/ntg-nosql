The National School of Drama would like to express its gratitude to Prof. Haridasa Bhatt, Principal
of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial College, Udipi, who
has assisted this venture through all its stages. Had it

not been for his consistent enthusiasm and hard work
this project would not have been possible.
The members of the Board of the Yakshagana
Kala Kendra and its staff are also to be thanked
for their unstinted support. We are also indebted
to the Director of Public Instruction of the Mysore
Government for so generously making the services

of Shri Rama Ganiga available to us.
Needless to say our gratitude to Dr. Shivaram
Karanth cannot be adequately expressed for his ser-

vices as patient counsellor, untiring teacher and
inspiring visionary. Shri B.V. Karanth’s devotion and
zeal have been exemplary and will remain in
memory of our students for many years to come.
