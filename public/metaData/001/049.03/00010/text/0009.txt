BHISHMA VIJAY : SYNOPSIS

In days gone by, the King of Kashi was Pratap-

sena.

His three daughters Amba, Ambika and Amba-

Iika having reached marriageable age, Kashiraja asks

his minister to make arrangements for their swayarnvara immediately and orders him to send messengers
to far-off places to invite kings on this auspicious
occasion.
Subsequently one of the messengers travels to the
palace of Raja Dridasena and conveys the happy tidings. In joyful anticipation the Raja sets out in his
chariot to participate in the swayarnvara.
King Salwa, however, learns from his servant that
he has not been invited for the swayarnvara and in a
high rage he sets out for Kashi without an invitation.
Meanwhile the Raja of Hastinapur, Bhishma, gets
news from his secret messengers about the swayamvara and even though he has not been invited, he vows
that he will win the three sisters Amba, Ambika and
Ambalika for his brother Vichitra Virya and sets out
in his chariot for the court of Kashiraja.
King Salwa, on his journey to Kashi, comes upon
the three princesses as they are sporting in a stream
near the woods. The two younger sisters get frightened and run away, but Amba remains and Salwa and

she discover a fascination for each other.
The Raja of Kashi in great humility welcomes all
the

Rajas

as

they

arrive

one

after another

at

the Swayarnvara Mandapa and then announces to all
present that his daughters shall marry the king who
triumphs over all others in the swayarnvara. The
entrance of Bhishma at this stage creates a commotion in the palace.
