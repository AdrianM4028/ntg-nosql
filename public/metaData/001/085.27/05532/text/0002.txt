TELLER, ON THE OTHER, THEY LIVE ONLY WHEN THEY ARE
PASSED ON FROM ONE STORY-TELLER TO ANOTHER.

THE SECOND TALE IS ENSCONCED WITHIN THIS. IT IS THE STORY
OF RANI WHO MAKES UP TALES TO FILL THE VOID IN HER LIFE.
RANI’S PREDICAIVfENT POIGNANTLY REFLECTS THE HUMAN NEED
TO LIVE BY FICTIONS AND HALF TRUTHS, AND THE NEED TO N'OT
PUSH THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH BEYOND THE POINT WHERE THE
EDIFICE OF DAY TO DAY LIVING MAY COME TUMBLING DOWN.

PROLOG UE

THE CUTAIN RISES ON AN ACTOR WHO HAS BEEN CURSED BY HIS
AUDIENCE THAT UNLESS HE STAYS TOTALLY AWAKE FOR ONE
WHOLE NIGHT DURING THE MONTH OF PAUSH, HE WILL DIE. HE
HAS TRIED TO DO SO FOR 29 DAYS, ONLY TO DOZE OFF, BELIEVING
HIS DREAMS TO BE REALITY. IT IS NOW THE LAST NIGHT OF THE
MONTH AND HE IS DESPERATE TO STAY AWAKE.

WNWHILE “FLAMES” FROM THE VARIOUS VILLAGE
HOUSE-HOLDS GATHER TOGETHER. ONE OF THEM RELATES HOW
HER MISTRESS HAD SEEN A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN LEAVING HER
HUSBAND ’S ROOM. THE PRETTY WOMAN IS ACTUALLY A “STORY”
AND HER SAREE A “SONG" WHICH HAD REMAINED WITHIN THE
OLD MISTRESS — UNTOLD AND UNSUNG.

THE "STORY" AND "SONG" ARRIVE AND SAY THAT UNLESS
SOMEONE LIS'I‘ENS TO THEM, THEY WILL 91E. --THE STORY NOW
