ONE DAY AN OLD WOMAN GIVES RANI A MAGICAL ROOT WHICH

WHEN RANI BECOMZES PREGNANT APANNA ACCUSES HER OF
ADULTERY AND LODGES A COMPLAINT IN THE VILLAGE COURT.
ON THE ADVICE OF THE COBRA, RANI DECIDES TO UNDERGO A
“COBRA—ORDEAL” AT THE TRIAL. ALTHOUGH THE VILLAGE
ELDERS TRY TO DISSUADE HER, RANI COMES THROUGH THE
ORDEAL UNSCATHED. REGARDED AS A GODDESS INCARNATE,
SHE NOW LIVES HAPPILY EVER AFTER WITH HER HUSBAND.

THE “STORY” IS NOW OVER. BUT FIRST THE ACTOR AND THEN THE
FIAMES REFUSE TO ACCEPT THIS ENDING. SO THE STORY IS
REPEATED WITH DIFFERENT ENDINGS

AS DAY BREAKS AND EVERYONE DISPERSES, THE ACTOR IS LEFT
CONFUSED. IS HE ALIVE OR DEAD .7 WAS RANI’S STORY A DREAM OR
REALITY?
