Some perceptions of ARJUN RAINA who plays Goya in this production . . .
“It is this vulnerability, this not belonging to any Witches Sabbath or the
Church that gives the individual both his aloneness and his freedom. It is the
frenzy of one who has not surrendered himself but still lives to hear his question

‘What shall I believe in?’, be answered. Have we progressed in time towards a
modern non-medieval world? Or is life a spire returning time and again to the
horrors of war and communalism reﬂected in its simplest form in domestic
strife? How much is violence part of the old man and how much is he free of it?”

The play is directed by ANAMIKA HAKSAR: Graduate National School of
Drama, 1979-82; Specialization in Direction from State Institute of Theatrical
Arts, Moscow; To her credit the ﬁrst Indo Theatre production, ‘Reminiscences

of Krishna’; In 1989 directed Gogol’s ‘Viy’ with her group Nirakar; ‘Grahon
Ki Kahani Grahon Ki Zabani, with Khilona group making innovative use of
theatre for science education; Dakghar (1989) with Shri Ram Centre Reportory,
chosen for the Sahitaya Kala Parishad Annual Drama Festival. A committed
theatre person in search of a new idiom through incorporating dialogue, music,
movement to present a total dramatic experience.
