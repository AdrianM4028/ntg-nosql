DREAM OF REASON
(in Hindi)
Valejo’s play is set in 18th century Spain during the terror stricken reign of
Ferdinand vii—in the era of the Civil War and the Inquisition. It is the story
of a 76 year old man—GOYA—an artist and court painter who has been at the
hub of matters all his life. Several ailments plague him for years leading to a
slow but complete descent into deafness. Sick in body and soul, deeply troubled
by the brutalising polity of Spain, he retires to a villa on the outskirts of Madrid.
Here he lives with his 35 year old housekeeper Leokadia and her two children,
one of whom, the girl Marikita, is said to be his. Goya pours his deep anguish
on to the walls of his house—painting the images and fantasies that haunt his
twilight hour . . . repressions and hangings of artists and intellectuals, his relationship with a married woman in Catholic Spain, an impending death when he
loves life so ﬁercely, the personal loss of Marikita who is sent away by Leokadia,
this loss symbolising all that Spain has lost. He is haunted by a madness that is
only a shade different to the cries of the crazy.

His only visitor is Dr. Arrieta, his closest friend and conﬁdante to whom he
explains his paintings and his innermost nightmares. The Doctor is the healer.
News comes of the execution of a senior artist. Both Leokadia and the Doctor
urge Goya to ﬂee Spain. But for Goya the life he seeks with such passionate
intensity is the life which is Spain.

The Priest Duaso, a man of faith and Goya’s childhood friend is sent as the
King’s emissary to command Goya to ask the King’s forgiveness.

Finally to make Goya submit the King’5 volunteers wreck and devastate Goya’s
home and humiliate Leokadia.

Ihe paintings of Goya’s black period are interwoven into the script.
We interpret this at times to bring alive the characters, at times to recreate
the atmosphere of the times and to refer to the textures and colours which
Goya used.
