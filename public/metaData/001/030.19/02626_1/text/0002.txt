Nirakar. . .
NIRAKAR, a theatre group,
was founded in 1989. It has
collaborated with people from
all walks of life — architects,
painters, film experts, dancers,
poets, mucisians. We have
tried to explore a theatre lan—
guage which involves poetic
metaphor, movement, images
and visuals alongwith text to
try and evolve a dramatic
language.

Freedom in my country
is the name of a jail
for political prisoners
and democracy forms
part of the title of
various regimes of terror
the word love defines
the relationship of a man
with his automobile and
revolution is understood
to describe what a
new detergent can do
in your kitchen. Glory is
something that a smooth soap
produces in its user and
happiness is a sensation
experienced while eating (Hot Dogs)
Freedom in my country?
means playing it safe
no risk man
walk out on people, backstab
them, being comfortable in
your (cliques) and supports

the state of being envied
is what constitutes glamour
l The choice is between a
Domino Pizza or a

Pizza Hut]
A peaceful country means in
many countries of Latin America
a well kept cemetery
and sometimes healthy man
must be read as impotent man
