A POEM

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure
It is our light not our darkness, that most frightens us .
We ask ourselves, 'who am | to be brilliant?
Actually who are you not to be.7

You are a child of God
Your playing small doesn‘t save the world

There is nothing enlightened about shrinking
so that other people won't feel insecure around you

We were born to manifest the glory of God that is within us ‘
It is not just in some of us it is in everyone
And as we let our own light shine,
we unconsciously give other people
the permission to do the same
As we are liberated from our own fears
our presence automatically liberates others.
