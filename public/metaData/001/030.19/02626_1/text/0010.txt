"No politiCIan can altogether afford to ignore the
atavist appeal of arms to male psyche. The word
weapon was up till the fourteenth century synonymous
with penis, the missiles and machine—guns, and the
sexy roar of the Tigers, still hold their phallic spell
whether in Iran or Los Angeles. It is no accident that
many of the most effective crusaders against arms
have been women, who are not vulnerable to this
primitive thrill, from Berthe Von Suttner to Alva lVlyrdal
and the many active young women now involved in the
movement for arms control. "
