Then what is the meaning of your teaching,
Of your imprisonment, of your life?

I have the feeling I shall spend my days
Of conﬁnement being asked the meaning
Of the meaning of the meaning until
My soul and meanings are exhausted by
Analyses. I’m sorry, I did not mean
To hurt you, dear friend. Your face betrays
My selﬁshness. The meaning is, we are two
