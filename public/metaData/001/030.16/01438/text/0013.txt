Acknowledgements

The production of ‘Khan Sab’ would not have
been possible if friends had not helped us in presenting this play.
We are especially indebted to Prof. Frank
Thakurdass on whose suggestions the play has been

structurally altered.

The organizational part was

attended to by Mrs. Mridula Krishna, Mrs. I.G.
Patel and Mr. Kailash Bajpai.
