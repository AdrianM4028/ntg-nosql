Bidesia«the f'olk theatre form is no longer strange to the Indian stage.
After nation wide presentation of ‘Amali’ (writer — Hrishikesh Sulabh/Director—

Satish Anand) on the modern stage, this form’s unbelievable communicability,
the ability of its theatrical nuances to reconstruct and give prof’ound descriptions of life and the immense possibilities that it holds for the development of
comtemporary theatre consciousness attracted the Indian theatre people, the
critics and the wide audience. ‘Mati Gari’ is the second in the series of presen—
tation of Bidesia theatre form.

In the last few years, Indian theatre activists have been looking for ways
and means to communicate usefully their society, time and life through the
medium of theatre forms associated with their local and folk life; t: ad?tional and
classical theatre forms, and the ancient and rich sanskrit theatre.

This search

is the sponteneous result of the desire to render lif'e richer with sensitivity,
progressive values and scientiﬁc outlook. These presentations of ‘Bidesia’ form
are our humble attempts towards search for meaningful theatre.

‘Bidesia’ is originally the name given to a theatre
Thakur and depicts with intensity the agony of Bihar’s
Bhikhari Thakur—the artist of the masses----and its
popular among the people for its communicability and

f'orm created by Bhikhari
masses. This creation of
presentation became very
humanitarian nature and

Bihar’s “Launda Naach” was given the name of ‘Bidesia’. ‘Bidesia’ is a generous

theatre form which has _:arnalgamated into itself Bengal’s ‘Jatra’ theatre form
