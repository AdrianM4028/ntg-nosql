landlords want to take possession of the land and both add to communal
tension and create a situation of confrontation Munshijee joins hands

afterwards. He has to announce his candidature in the forthcoming election and any communal clash may affect adversely. He throws a new
move. He holds Amali responsible for this and using his political wit he

brings Mahadev Rai and Abrar Khan to the point that a school building
will be constructed over the land and Amali be outcasted of the village.
Bachana, friend of Rarnesar, opposses and is killed by the Musclemen of
the two landlords. Opposition is symbolically crushed and the villagers
keep mum out of fear. Amali is compelled to leave the village. She sings

a song in Sorathi style, SUB KAR GINIGIA HO RAMA SUKHAWA
SE BHARAL NU RE KI which tells that the nest was blown by the
wind and the entire village was a silent spectator. She asks a question as
to how long this exploitation will continue ?

And the play ends with a choral song Bharat Vakaya SISIK SISIK
KAR JANI SUB LOGAVA by Samajee (chorus) which gives answer to
Amali’s question that so long people will tolerate the sufferings, they will
have to be in such a condition of torture and exploitation. Learn, 0’
peOple, to stop the banishment of Amali and then you can breath in a
comfortable air. In order to remove the death-trap you will have to move
your hands and put strength to them. With this Optimistic note, the
play ends.
