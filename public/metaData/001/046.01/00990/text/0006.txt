presents

As a revenger he must act, on behalf of
outraged virtue, to restore a violated order,

ruthless revenger he exemplifies in his own

person the evil which is inseparable from
the good in human nature; as the reluctant
revenger he can symbolize the good '5

tragically not until death approaches —
