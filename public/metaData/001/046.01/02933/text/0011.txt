DIRECTOR’S NOTE
Can Music be heard through eyes?
- My journey into diverse

theatrical

experiments over the years, has made me more

concerned about the ancient idea of theatre as
Drishya Kavya or visual poetry. Since last four
years as well as in this production my concern
has been to understand the meaning of Drishya
Kavya: to convert words into musical/dramatic
sounds without, of course, undermining their
power as dramatic text.

Working on this play has been ’very
rewarding because Baki Itihas offers an
interesting understanding of the transition to
Badal Sircar's later phase of playwriting. The
tendencies are quite emergent in this play.
A play at best is a thread of arguments,

situations and other social contexts. A
performance is an extension of this thread to a
three dimensional tangible experience where
contexts and references emerge and vanish while
the body of the production enjoys independent
life and dies with the curtain fall every evening.
And what it should leave with us is images, not
pictorial but 'theatrical where sound and scene
come together to acquire a third existence a,

metamorphoSed existence.

A theatrical presentation to my mind is
essentially something which should touch the
senses; lift them to a therapeutic ecstacy and

scenes should not be misunderstood. I only. have
attempted to extend and explain the inherent
images of the play. We have tried to go along the
lines of Badal Sircar as a playwright and as a
theatre director, who pioneered in the early

aesthetic satisfaction. Softening of our senses is a
larger target than just inducing a short sighted
