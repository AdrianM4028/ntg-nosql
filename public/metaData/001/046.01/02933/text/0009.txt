European classics, but also to plays in other Indian
languages specially Bengali Marathi and
Kannada
It was my involvement with I PTA which had
led me earlier during the forties to translate Bijon
Bhattacharya’s plays [abanbandi (Antin Abllilaslla)
and Nabanna both on the Bengal Famine of 1943.
Later, my association with the National School of
Drama & Asian Theatre Institute from its inception
in 1958 onwards made me translate a number of

plays from various languages. Badal Sircar’s Baki
[ti/ms is one of them.
Baki Itihas is a fascinating play which in many
ways is not only the best work of Badal Sircar,

with an unusual juxtaposition of styles Its first

two acts verge on obvious melodrama, seemingly
unconnected but very subtly suggesting the main
theme while the third is a kind of fantasy with an
interesting mix of didactic argument. The language
of each act has a separate ﬂavour and shows the
playwright's control over his medium I believe
the play retains its appeal even today
Translating Indian plays has its own
challenges Different regions and languages of our

country are a kind of variation of the common
theme of Indian sensibility culture social structure
and creative expression In a translation it is often
very difficult to capture this distinctiveness of the

captured in my translation but certainly I enjoyed
doing it three decades ago. I hope the spectator
will enjoy seeing it even today
