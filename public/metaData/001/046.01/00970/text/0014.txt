After a long gap,

I have entered into a pure

theatrical environment.

I have got anew dimension

in my personality-working with Mr. Karanth.

A real sense of theatre, which found here is
with exclusive genuineness and it's genuine exclusive-

ness.

My previous liking of theatre music is turned

into creative theatre music only because of this mean-

ingful workshop.

Mysore was wondeful. Kamsale was thrilling.
The play process could have been both, time willing.
