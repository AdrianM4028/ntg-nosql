S YN OPSIS

The beauty of Nala, the young king of Nishada
and Damayanti the princess of vidarbha was famous.
This fame planted the seed of love in their mind.
though they did not see each other.

A swan became

the messenger of their love. Darnayanti chose Nala
as her husband in her swayamvara. Kaliyuga, the
God of darkness-desired Damayanti. But failed to
achive her and decided to have revenge on Nala. On

day he got chance and entered in the body of Nala.
Inﬂuence of kaliyuga made Naia ill-fated and he
lost all his properties, kingdom and power. With his
Wife Damayanti he left the kingdom and entered in

the jungle.

But he could not escape from kali’s inﬂu-

ence and became an ugly dwarf.

He left his wife

alone.

Their seperation created the way of their re-union
after a long strUggie. With their re-union, the idea
of love became the winner against all the barriers.
