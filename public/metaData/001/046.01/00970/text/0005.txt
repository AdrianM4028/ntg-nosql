AN INTRODUCTION TO NALA CAHRITRA
Nala charitra by Kanakadasa is kannada adaptation of ‘Nalopakhyan’ -a story told by sage
Dhaumya to the pandavas in the 28th chapter of
mahabharata.
Kanakadasa, who wrote this version of Nala
Damayanti in early 16th century-introduced some
new situations and characters in his work-which
made no harm … to the main story. Kanakadasa who
was not. a meterialist-showed the idea of love more
strong than the love itself.

The author never used any thrilling elements in
his work though he had opportunites.

His ultimate

aim was to reach up to the end with a smooth rythmthat’s why he never described any sitution in a lengthy

way. For example. He described the birth of
Damayanti only in four stanzas. it is hard to be
disinterested inm-between because of his simple and
easy communicating style.
There are some flashes of the author’s subjective
' thoughts in this work-which have made it earthily.
He used the ancient Indian concept of fate in his
works-which he experienced in his own life. He
lost his properties, social position and every thing for
a sudden accident-and realised that the fate plays
with the human being in a very cruel manner to
examine his strength and will power. Kanakadasa
proved his strength-but most probably

could not

forget that very tragic moment in his life. It reflected
in Nala’s tragedy. Nala became

Bahuka as Kanaka
