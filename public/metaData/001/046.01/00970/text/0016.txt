This tour, workshop, production, Rangayana and

Baba they have created a new envirnoment around me
and made me

“confused.” I am trying to understand

it-as a theatre worker and as a human being. I am
searching my own identity in this environment. It is
a precious experience.
Sidhartha Chakraborthy
CALCUT'I‘A
Every experience is a mixmatch of good & bad
and I, as a student of Drama must keep note of both

these factors-

So when I note my experience, I must

state that not withstanding “Baba’s” fame which he
truly deserves, I for one was disappointed with the
play process.
