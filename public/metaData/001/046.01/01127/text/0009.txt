Then in my College time I had the opportunity to learn from
most renowned playwright and director of Manipur called
G. C. Tongbra. He was a teacher in the College. Since I could
establish an intimate relationship with him, I started working
under his supervision in his Group called “Society Theatre“

I came to understand the basic principles of playWrig-hting

I found my weaknesses as an actor and turned to playwrigh-

I wrote

and directed a social play, “ LAYEN AHANBA ” about the
problem of a traditional society when modern society, enters

How did H. Sabitri enter into your profession and life ?

In that production

which I have just talked about, we had

engaged Sabitri for a role. I was very much impressed by
her talent and fell in love With her. I married her in 1961. My
family did not like her because of her being an actress. Taking
this experience of rejection by my family, I wrote a play on the
life of an actress who as an individual struggles against the

soceity. It was a serious play and I discovered my individuality
and originality. It was a realistic, melodramatic play but with
a protest.
