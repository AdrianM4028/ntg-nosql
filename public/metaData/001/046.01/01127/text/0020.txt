In 1983,
I watched the performance of
“ PEBET ” by
Mr. H. Kanhailal’s troup, in Mysore, I was thrilled and moved by the
spirit of Smt. Savitri Devi who played the major role as also of the actors.
Whenever I watched a Folk performance, I was confronted with (11108tion How these forms can be explored for a modern theatre. After wor-

king with Mr. H. Kanhailal, I have come to realise that we have to imbibe the life and spirit of traditional artists, not the external. decorative
elements of their arts. This is the beautifuly blend in Mr. H. Kanhailal’s
work and I have learned a lot from his new methedology.
I think for a young theatre worker who belongs to a region, like mine.

this workshop becomes a stepping stone in discovering

our

indige-

nious style in the last decade of the century.
