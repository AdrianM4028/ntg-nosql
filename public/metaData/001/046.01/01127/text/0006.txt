DIRECTORS NOT E

In the beginning of the workshop and rehearsals I felt a distance between
the students and myself though personally We were intimate with each other.
As the process of workshop and production grew day by day through
confrontation and sometimes with a spirit of give and take intimacy bet-

ween the students and myself had become intimacy in the work process also.
Naturally absorption of new environment and working system takes at
least a longer time than we are given.

However in this short period of

one month the struggle of the students to realize themselves in the right
process of the workshop is very rewarding. The production itself projects
their creative endeavour.
I feel that the process of how a studentâ€™s
production will grow up.
