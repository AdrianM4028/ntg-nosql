A conversation between H. Kanhailal and

Devendra Raj Ankur

D.R . A . :

Tell us in brief about your early journey into theatre.

H, K,

I began to love theatre right from my childhool.

:

[ was very

much fascinated by the then proscenium theatre and the Jatra
Fortunately my father took me to the regular proscenium
theatre and Jatras performed in my locality. Thus I started
working with children friends in my Mahalla, imitating the

performances seen by us.
Then during my School days in 1957, on the occassion of

Saraswati Puja the Students organised a production of a
play on a Manipur rebellion against the British. In that play
I took the role of a Manipuri General. After the performance
my love for theatre was recognised by the School teachers and
fellow students. As I got the encouragement, I became much
more interested in acting.
