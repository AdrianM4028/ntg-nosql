Recognised the own home

Seeing the footprints of f'orefather’s.
Learnt from wildbirdsHow to ﬂy and breathe
In open sky.
Heard from womanLand’s son’s song,

And l<hair11b’s love for ThoibiLearnt how to make others weep,
I didn’t give her
Even a single coin
She does’nt know
i can sell everything,
in the Market of
Lifeless: human beings.
