I lost a few days in the beginning, of the course as if I was a lost.
Everything can not be eunted as only experience because it is a question
of basical reactions of man.

So naturally there will be some questions,

disagreements and painful depressions.

The learning part of this particular workshop is beneﬁcial. We have
been taught the very basic chapters of a trainee acton which we did not
get in NSD (Delhi). I felt I had a lot to learn seeing their stock material
that can be taught to an actor.

Director with his team tried their best to teach us—-- with necessary
comfort.
No doubt, the crucial one was the script.

This is the ﬁrst time we are

doing any traditional or folk production for which we have been crying.
Ofcourse the script is a very simple one. That’s why now it demands more
theatricality than the text has.
I would like to say that keeping in mind for the ﬁnal year’s students of
NSD the selection of script could have been something more. One can
easily say the appreciation part of this writing a concealed kind of ‘def'ence
mechanism’ one way it is.

I got a new theatre environment in Manipur which I never got in
Delhi. The best part of the workshop was a seven~day mini theatre
f'estival based on Minipuri traditional performing arts. I was very
much fascinated by the perf’ormences of Savitri Bhabi ( Mrs. Kanhailal ).
In my short theatre career, I have never come across such a startling per-

f'ormence.

Whatever we have learnt in martial art, movement, and voice

& speech, we are trying to make best use of it in our production.
