in their shirts in their detachable collars
in their rnonocles in their bowler hats

I feel ridiculous
with my toes which were not made to

perspire from morning to night
with wrappings which weaken the limbs
and take away from my body its beauty of hidden sex
I feel ridiculous with my neck in the smoke stack
with these headaches which cease
each time I bow to someone
I feel ridiculous
in their drawing rooms in their manners

in their bows in their formulas
in their manifold needs of apish antics
I feel ridiculous
with all they relate
until they serve you in the afternoon a bit of hot water
and sickly cakes
I feel ridiculous
with the theories they season
to the taste of their needs of their passions
of their instincts revealed in the night in form of a doormat
I feel ridiculous
among them as accomplice among them a pimp
amo g them a butcher with hands frighlfally red
है with the blood of their civilization
Leon Dam as
French Guiana.

From African songs of Love, war, grief and abuse 1961.
