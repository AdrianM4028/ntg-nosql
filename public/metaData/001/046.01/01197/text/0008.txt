I Slow but steady grip on unknown horizon.
A psychological treatment with actors also. Oh so fantastic, really.

If Unspoken, an animal speaks his thoughts, and lives his life in his own way, It's once in
hundred words. The tales of King and queens, from granny’s lips every day. in the darkness
breathes its life, a lamp and its ﬂame
--Harvinder Kaur

Human psychology was always something of enthralling fascination, but too deep to take a

plunge into... “Aitash” was like the Unicorn, who rose from the depth of the ocean, took us
on his back and galloped into the distant horizon... The horizon that had always been out of
bounds.

Arun is the only real person I ever met in my personality, who could teach me what it
means to be a complete person. He would not talk, he would not play, in reality he was
brilliant, very sensitive lonely child trapped in a prison of fear & rage. Perhaps there is more
understanding & beauty in life when the glaring sunlight is softened by the patterns of
shadows. l enjoyed this outraged outburst.
——Milino' Inamdar

Once again speaking through body. Maharishiji gave me a free hand he made me do the
way he wanted. Horse, my favourite animal- Tough job - But that is what an actor wants.
—Adil Hussain

I like the play very much. There is somewhat a very unique experience all together
