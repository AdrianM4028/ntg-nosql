TH E AUTHOR
Peter Shaffer was born into an orthodox Jewish family in
Liverpool the year of the General Strike. He studied history
at Trinity, Cambridge, but did not go there until he had
finished his war service as a ‘Bevin boy’ conscripted to the
coal mines.
For five years after leaving university, he wandered from job
to job, from Doubledays Bookshop in New York (‘I didn’t
have the required aggression’) to the acquisitions
department of the New York Public Library (‘an
overwhelmingly dull world of card indexes’) to the symphonic
department of the music publishers Boosey and Hawkes in
London. ‘I can’t do office work very well,’ says Shaffer, ‘and
when I was offered a job in a brass band factory in Edgware,
I said “No”. He believed that he was ‘unemployabIe-’ (I still
believe it. It is true.’)
He had been attracted to the theatre at an early age-his
mother had read Shakespeare to him as a boy. He
remembers vividly the ‘richness of imagery and the beauty of
the language’. When he saw John Gielgud play Richard II at
the Golder's Green Hippodrome (an admiration for the actor
which has remained since) Shaffer was stunned, therefore,
when Tennant phoned him about a script they had had for
six months called Five Finger Exercise, asking if he would
mind Gielgud directing it. Its success at the Comedy in 1958
‘gave me the confidence l badly needed, and solved my
cash problems. From then, I was a playwright.’
