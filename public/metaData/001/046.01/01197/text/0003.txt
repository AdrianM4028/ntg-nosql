DIRECTOR'S NOTE
I think the play has not received a good production in
this country. Just as we have occasionally flirted with
political ideas, We have only casually used
psychology in the theatre. Any of the realistic plays of
the past hardly stand up to scrutiny. This is surprising
in a land which abounce in rich mythological material
which surely has the strength to lead us deeper into
the rnystries of the mind. Plays like EQUUS are
welcome in original or in good adaptations for the
point to the fact that there are immense possibilities
yet to be tapped in the area of so called realistic
theatre.
Coming back to NSD after so many years as a
Visiting Director and working with talented third year
students is both exciting and interesting. I am grateful
for all the affection and respect, l have received.

इन एतश अश्व रूपी मंत्रों के द्वारा उद्गमन करता हुआ सूर्य हमारे लिए
यात्रा करे । ( ऋग्वेद- 7 (2 .2 )
है सूर्य, तुम्हारे लिए ऐसा कोई भी असुर या उत्तम सुरलोक नहीं, जिसे तुम
अपने वेगचान् एतश अष्टवों से युक्त रथ में चलकर, प्राची से पश्चिम तक,
रज को जल के समान, अपने प्रकाश से परिपूर्ण न करते हो।
( ऋग्वेद- 30 .37 .3 )
