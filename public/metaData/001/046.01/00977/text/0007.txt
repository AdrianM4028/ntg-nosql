SET DESI G N ER SAYS .........

The play, which you are about to witness, was orginally planned as
an outdoor production presented

in a realistic style.

The sudden

onset of winter however forced us to change our plans. The idea of
performance within a theatre, which had not been considered appropriate initially for a play so vast in concept and scope, had to be per-

force accepted and we decided to mount it in the rather narrow and
conﬁned space of the Circulation Unit (Studio No-Z). The change
forced upon us by circumstances beyond our control created a lot of
problems especially in the lay-out and designing of the set. The
change over from a very large scale to a very limited space also led to

a complete change of style which unfortunately limited audience space
and performing space drastically.

I have

done the best I could

within the changed parameters, and I sincerely hope that despite
च the severe constraints of space you will still ﬁnd the production to
… your liking.
