PRODUCER’S NOTE

Wars are invariably let loose upon humanity by power hungry,
unscruplous men in power, be they monarchs, kings or politicians. An
arms race is on, a race to acquire most deadly weapons in the name
of ‘balance of power’, ‘balance of fear’ and ‘balance of strategy’. Those
indulging in this senseless, rnad race are least concerned with the

misery and destruction of life and material. They are more concerned
with their proﬁts keeping their war industries running. They engineer
wars involving various nations and it is the common man, the
humanity at large is the casualty.
This drama reﬂects deep concern over the ravages of wars.
