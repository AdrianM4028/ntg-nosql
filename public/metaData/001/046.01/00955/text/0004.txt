ABOUT THE PLAYWRIGHT
Bertolt Brecht was born in Augsburg on 10 February 1898. By 1916
he followed with the greatest interest all contemporary literature he
could lay his hands on; Hauptrnann, Frank Wedekind, Bernard
Shaw and August Strindberg.
In the early twenties Brecht recognized the dangers of Hitlerisrn,
which led him to study Marxism. By 1929 he came into contact with
workers, trade unionists and representatives of the communist
party. It sharpened his sensibility and he thus started working out
new modes of social behaviour, to demonstrate a communist ethic

that incorporated a new historic and humane quality. ’We derive
our morality from the interests of the proletarian class struggle.’
During this period he wrote didactic plays, The Measures Taken, He

Who Says Yes and He Who Says No.
Brecht went into revolutionary exile immediately after Hitler
came to power in 1933. During this period of exile he wrote The Life
of Gallileo, Mother Courage and The Caucasian Chalk Circle. He went to
the United States in 1941, but America also proved difficult for him
and he decided to return to Europe when he was caught up in the
McCarthy witchhunts in the late forties. He finally settled in East
Berlin where he and his wife Helene Weigel, started the Berliner
Ensemble Theatre Company.
It is not important
that when you die, you be a good man
but when you die
you take leave of a healthy society.
