REALISM DEBATE
When the slogan ’Por Humanism’ has not yet been supplemented by
the slogan ’Against the Bourgeoise Conditions owanership,’ literature has not yet turned to the people.
"Theatre is an illusion of reality: To present reality in such a way that
it can be grasped’. . . . Brecht argued that reality cannot be presented
without recognizing its dialectical nature. He found it essential
therefore ’to indicate the conﬂicting, courtroom—like nature of the
situations, events and characters’. The task of the alienation effect

was to make it possible to present ’this dialectical nature’. The tragic
element had to be of secondary importance. Alienation meant ’to
announce a contradiction’. . . . Brecht wanted to use the alienation
effects to excite conflicting emotions and make dialecticians of the
audience. George Lukacs, a Marxist literary historian, was not
interested in influencing reality; what he sought was the ’artistic
experience’. Brecht’s epic was an attempt to wrench this ’artistic
experience’ away from metaphysics and bring it down to earth.
