poses to Hjalmar the deceptions and illusions responsible for
the Ekdal’s low estate. Using a 'retrospective' method, reminiscent of classical plays like Oedipus, the action proceeds
as Grcger’s rakes up the past in order to awaken Hjalmar to

his “claim of the ideal. " In the process he only succeeds in
making people aware of issues and incidents for which they
have no solution, and thereby brings tragedy to the once
placid household. Gregers’ adversary is Relling, a doctor
who, with down-to-earth practicality believes in nursing
peoples’ illusions so that they might have the will to live,
In its simplest terms the thematic assertion derived from
the basic conﬂict between truth and illusion is stated by
Relling : “Rob

the average man of his life illusion and you

rob him of his happiness at the same stroke”.

Better to live

happily in illusions which one does not recongnize as such,
than to be aware of the truth when one’s life, consequently,
may be wretched.

To extract the theme so baldly, however

is to lose sight of its powerful dramatic expression which is

Relling, though he comes closest to being lbsen’s spokesman
and

strikes us as an extremely clever and intelligent realist

does not impress us as being an alltogether admirable character,

On

necessary

to distinguish

between his ideals,

which Ibsen does not attack, and the monstrous, blundering
use to which Gregers puts them, for it is the blundering that
is the object of the dramatist’s bitter satire.

Also, it is im-

portant to consider the alternative attitudes to life presented
by Gina and Mrs. Sorby (Werles intended wife, with a not
unblemished past), and even by Werle himself, who is at no
point condemned outright by Ibsen.
