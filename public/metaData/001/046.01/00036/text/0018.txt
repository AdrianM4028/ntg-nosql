others were simple opponents of naturalism, Brecht was its

problems on to the stage, but Zola hoped to make the
spectators take the problem seriously by involving him
in it whereas Brecht wanted to suprise him by detatching
him from it until he could view it coolly with unmisted

eyes. To convince the Spectator that the problem was a
real one the naturalists used on accumuiation of detail;
Brecht maintained that it would only be done by a selection
of detail. And with Selection comes the element of style
which is lacking in pure realism.
