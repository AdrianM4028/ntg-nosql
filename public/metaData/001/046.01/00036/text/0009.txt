plicity of associations built up around it, he may ﬁnd an
amused consolation in the despair of the French critic Sarcey
who saw the play at Antoine's Theatre Libre in 1891. “Ah,
that wild duck”. Nobody in the world, nobody in the
universe, not you who have heard the play, nor Linder
laub and Ephraim who translated it exactly, nor the author

who wrote it, nor Shakespeare who inspired it, nor God, nor
the devil-nobody will even know what that ‘wild duck' is,
nor what it is doing in the play, nor what it means, nor what
it rimes with.” Sarcey somewhat overstated the case. Though

the wild duck holds a different signiﬁcance and dramatically
has a different relationship with each character, on the most
obvious level, both the wild duck and the garret are symbols
ot the life of illusion. The rest will increase or decrease in
meaning, depending on the imagination of the players and

their audience.
