Eventually, the government
and

money

for

foreign

did give him a modest grant
travel,

He

moved to Rome

and later to Dresden where during the next 25 years
he wrote his most famous plays. He visited Norway, only
brieﬂy, during these years but he finally returned in 1891 to

a Norway where the earlier hostility and bitterness aroused by
his dramas had turned to acclaim.

In his plays, from

“Pillars of Society" to “Hedda Gabler", be dealt with many of
the social and ethical problems that existed in a complacent
world, showing to Shaw and his contemporaries that the
theatre could not only entertain but enlighten, and that it
could

be

the artistic instrument for

presenting serious,

even revolutionary, views about the freedom and dignity of
the individual in conﬂict with the pressures of modern
society. His attack on the conventional treatment of women
in Doll’s House (1879) made the play a milestone in dramatic
history, marking the beginning of the modern theatre.
