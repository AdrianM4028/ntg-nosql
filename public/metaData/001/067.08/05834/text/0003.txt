In Mukti, the first Rangakarmee production in

Bengali, based on a story by Mahasweta Devi,

Mukti, widowed early in life, spends the better

part of the rest of her life, working for all practical purposes as a maid in the homes of rich re-

lations, the exploitation barely veiled under the
pretence of kinship. Late in life, when the young

daughter of one of these employees of hers
takes a stand for her, she gathers strength to
assert her independence. A chance meeting with
a man who had once fallen in love with her, but
now as lonely as her, helps her make the deci-

sion to claim her life’s saving and break free. 0
