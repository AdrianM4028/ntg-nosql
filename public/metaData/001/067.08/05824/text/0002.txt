The search for a new dawn
Bhor is the search for a new
dawn. Set in a rehabilitation
centre, it is about a group of

young boys and their struggle
against the disease of addiction.
It explores the various causes

whether it is poverty? failed love?

or is it a broken family? The
“junk” to which these young
boys, full of promise, are addicted
to, is the product of an overtly

commercial society. It is
produced and sold like any other

product and the young and
helpless individuals have to ﬁght
on their own to transcend its

barbed wires.
However, it is not a mere play on

addiction: it is about human
relationships. In the words of the
playwright: “This play could have

been set in an University or a Jail.
“It is about the claustrophobia
that the youth feel in our
contemporary society and their

struggle against it. Bhor is about
the dawn of this struggle.
