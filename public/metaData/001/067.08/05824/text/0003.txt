Director’s Note
As a director I have always tried to protray the socio—political scenario of
the society, the section of the society which we don’t want to highlight.

The explotation of woman and the constant anxiety amongst the day to
day to living gave birth to RUDALI, COURTMARTIAL and
KAS H INAMA.

When 1 was doing ‘HOLI’ 1 realized the claustrophobia within the youth.
1 wanted to work on that as a subject.
ln 1986, 1 wrote my first original script ‘KHOJ’ where the duality of the
middle class society and theatre was highlighted. But the youth was
restless all around and times were changing.

addiction, addicts and rehabs. The section which was again kept
anonymous. People were not comfortable talking about it.
