Caught in the utter confusion of an exchange of lunatics
between India and Pakistan. Bishan Singh, a Sikh lunatic in a
camp in Pakistan, is obsessed with Toba Tek Singh, ‘the small
village in the Punjab which was his home’, and when he cannot
really understand where the village has gone, the loss leaves
him shattered, he refuses to be pushed into India, declares
himself ‘Toba Tek Singh', and finally, 'there. behind barbed
wire. on one side, lay India and behind more barbed wire, on
the other side, lay Pakistan, In between, on a bit of earth which
has no name, lay Toba Tek Singh.’
