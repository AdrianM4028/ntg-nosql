Sirajuddin gets separated from his daughter Sakina in the turmoil
of the eight hours' journey by train from Amritsar to M ughalpu ra . It
is only when the maze of images — looting, ﬁre. running for life,
station. gunshots, night and Sakina... — settles down to a still
focus that Sir'ajuddin becomes aware of the loss. and in his
desperate bid to recover Sakina, he only manages to place her in
the hands of a band young razakars [volunteers], who seduce her,
rape her and leave her to die.
