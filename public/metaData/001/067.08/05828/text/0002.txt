In this yeariong exposition of Saadat Hasan Manto,
Rangakarmee enters its second phase with the double bill
of Khol 00 [‘Open Up'] and Toba Tek Singh, stories
centering on the Partition. In both the stories, old men — the
Muslim Sirajuddin in the former and the Sikh Bishan Singh
in the latter experience the shock of Partition as a terrible
wrench .

As the mad Bishan Singh turns into Toba Tek Singh, and
Sirajuddin sees life-almost in the manner Lear sees life in
the dead Cordelia — in the naked corpse of Sakina, the one
with the mole , Manto seems to suggest how madness alone

can bring a sufferer/victim to terms with the horror of a
country torn apart by communal politics. Tragedy strikes
differently in the two stories, sanity breaking down under
stress in the ﬁrst story. insanity raised to the ecstasy of an
emancipatory choice in the second story.
The short plays will be woven together with some ironic
snippets written by Manto — what he called Siyah Hashye or
“black fringes' - because he felt " lf Independence was
something bright and good then it was fringed with
something black as well”. These will be narrated by directoractress Usha Ganguli.
