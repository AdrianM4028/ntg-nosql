Nobody would believe that the oppression aga
inst the major
part of the society will suddenly come to a halt
after 40 years
of independence.
Though talks and discussions about it keep
cropping up now and then, eXperience tells us t
hat ministers
and other public servants have really done litt
le to stop such
oppression..
The 50=called representatives of the people
a
r
e
merely interested in securing political gains
from issues of
social injustice.
In this 40 years, bug talks and tall
promises of social justice have been made w
hile the real issues
have been pushed further and further into negl
ect.
It is also
sad that innumerable incidents of rape and voi
lence-against the
oppressed of the society have failed to inspi
re the masses to
raise their voice and hands in pro:est.
No God or saint can.sudi hi; apcear to change
this repressive“

It is common peo 1e like us who ave to take

cudgel against social wrongs.
But how arten do we bother to do
so? Writer Ratnakar Matkari
