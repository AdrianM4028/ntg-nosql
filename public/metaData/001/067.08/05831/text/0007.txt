Akademi awardee, came into prominence with two
consecutive outstanding productions in the early
seven ties R aj r a k t a ( I 9 7 2 ) by M o h i t

Chattopadhyay and Chakbhanga Madhu (1972)
by Manoj Mitra. While he has worked closely with
directors like Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay and Fritz
Bennewitz; as associate and actor; he has directed a

wide range ofplays, for his own group—Anya
Theatre, and other groups. His 1988 production,
Madhab Malanchi Koinya, modelled on folk
conventions, and telling fairy tale, has been one of
the most popular Bengali productions ever: His work
with Rangakarmee for Vama has been a major
departurefor him.

Lighting Designer
Tapas Sen perhaps needs no introduction as he is
widely known for his excellence in lighting design
for many mega events, son-et—lumiere spectacles
across the country and in innumerable theatre
productions. In fact his innovative style of light
designing has contributed immensely towards the
successful performance of host of theatres for the
last 5 decades and has also raised the discipline of
light designing to an extraordinary height.
This septuagenarian lighting artist is still working
actively with spartan zeal and indomitable spirit
Rangakarmee’s production VAMA has been
enriched by Tapas Sen ’s imaginative lighting design.
