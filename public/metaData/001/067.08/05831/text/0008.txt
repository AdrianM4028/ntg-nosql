the state, breaking language barriers and reaching
an audience thatfew theatre groups have reached

formation of a study group within Rangalearmee,
core group of twenty engaged in close study of
theatre in all its aspects, independent experiment
and creative exercises, some of them growing into
productions; a repertoire of short playsfor open air
oï¬‚-proscenium performances; and the Sambhavana
project, through which Rangalearmee activists visit
schools to develop and nurture theatre creativity
among children, especially deprived children, as
part of their education.
