Theatre workers in Calcutta remember the
killing of Prabir Dutta at an open air
performance of a streetplay in the Curzon Park
in the early seventies and the case of the
eminent actor and director who refused to
accept the proposition that the police could beat
a person to death in prison or on the street, for
accepting that amounted to denying the entire
system of law and orderFrance Rame’s play
Ulrike Meinhoﬂ closes on hate directed against
the imbecility of the killers and those who
sustain them by their silence. India has had a
fairly long and shameful record of such
imbecility that Rame makes her real target in
her exposition of the mysterious ‘suicides’ in
prison ascribed to Baden, Eustin, Raspe and
Ulrike Meinhoﬁf Ulrike was the first to be ‘found’
dead while their trial was in progress. When her
coaccused refused to accept the evidence offered
for her ‘suicide’ and questioned the legal
process itself all three of them were ‘found’ dead
in prison, bringing the legal proceedings to an
end. When Rame staged this play first on the
occasion of the first death anniversary of Ulrike
Meinheﬁ in May 19 77, the Stamnheim trial was
still continuing, and Ulrike’s fellow accused
were still putting up a bravefight.
