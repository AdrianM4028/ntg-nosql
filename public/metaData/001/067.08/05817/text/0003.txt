To day we present to you three short plays in
Hindi. While SUBAH is an adaptation based on
the English version of Franca Rame’s WAKING
UP written originally in Italian, the other two
plays THE JEWS WIFE BY Bertolt Brecht and
ULRIKE MEINHOFF by Franca Rame have
been translated into Hindi from the English
rendering of the original works in German and
Italian respectively.

Theatre workers in Calcutta remember the
killing of Prabir Dutta at an open air performance of a street play in the Curzon park in the
early seventies, and the case of the eminent actor

and director who refused to be party to the
protest on the ground that he refused to accept
the proposition that the police could beat a
person to death in prison or on the street for
accepting that amounted to denying the entire
system of law and order. Franca Rarne’s paly
ULRIKE MEINHOFF closes on hate directed
against the imbecility of the killers and those
who sustain them by their silence.
