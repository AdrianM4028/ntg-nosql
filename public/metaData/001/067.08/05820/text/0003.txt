- THE GROUP

Rangakarmee, which had its inception in January 1976,
spearheads the Hindi theatre in Calcutta to-day, with
seven productions on its live repertoire (three of them
nearing hundred performances each). With Mahabhoj
(1984), Lokkatha (1987), Holi (1989), Vama (1990), Court
Martial (1991),and Fludali (1993), it has established
itself as a politically committed group, that delves into
forms of exploitation and oppression, political, economic,
social and sexual; unravelling the mechanisms at work,
offering enlightenment at the end, and never simplifying
the issues into slogans or solutions. Recognition has
come to Rangakarmee in the form of several awards,
including the State Government's award for the best
production of the year for four of its productions till date.
Flangakarmee has travelled extensively to different parts
of the country, to rural interiors and industrial suburbs
spread throughout the State, breaking language barriers
and reaching an audience that few theatre groups have
reached till now.
