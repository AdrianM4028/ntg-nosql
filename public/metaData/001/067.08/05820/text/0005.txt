ON THE PLAY

Khoj uses theatre
or more specifically the daily life
and politics of one of those many non-professional,
militant, experimental theatre groups, performing in
as a space where the
Bengali or Hindi in Calcutta
contradictions, tensions, frustrations and energies of
middle class life in this city come into play and offer the
opportunity to study them more closely and critically. As
teacher and director, I have been disturbed over the last
decade by the relentless decline of values and ideals in
urban middle class life in India; and the more l have
followed the cultural and economic decline, the more I
have come up against one single deadly feature, namely,
cynical disparity between words- and deeds. Ritwik
Ghatak's Komalgandhar was instrUmental in determining
my choice of a theatre group in its setting, to illustrate
and explore this situation. The theatre group and its
problems are merely the outer structure in Khoj for the
more complex problem underneath. The real problem
lies in the natural uncertainty and insecurity of the
middle class, held back by almost insurmountable
economic constraints, reaching out for opportunities for

an upward drive elsewhere, too often using cultural
positions as a stepping stone to social mobility upwards;
and in the process getting implicated in the worst kind
of compromises and betrayals. At the same time I have
known committed loners enough, prepared to carry on
with the good fight --- beyond striving for 'success' l
Khoj is not a play about theatre, but about the theatre
of middle class-life itself, in its raw reality.
