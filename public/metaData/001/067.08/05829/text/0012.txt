When I was asked to put up a new play in Berhampore
Central Correctional Home I did not find the task easy as our
jail inmates were not professional actors . Yet I ventured to
produce a full-fledged play and chose’ Totakahini’ ,a short story
of Rabindranath . I decided to involve the inmates in it through
music therapy and practice in coordinated movements.

Totakahini is about a parrot which danced and sang
freely. On the king’s order it was caught and put into a cage . The
bird was to be “taught” . Imprisoned in a cage of rules and
regulations with forced learning,Tota stopped singing and
dancing. The king was happy with the rigorous routine of
learning he had imposed on Tota but the poor bird’s free spirit
was broken. It died. The story proves Rabindranath’s view that
rote learning of texts mars the freedom of spirit which is worse
than death.

West Bengal’s prisons are now called correctional
homes where inmates would be helped to rectify the
aberrations which caused them to commit crimes. One of the
most successful methods for the achievement of the correction
has been the Culture Therapy Programme ,which through the
use of art, dance , music, poetry and theatre has brought about
an unthought of before psychological and physiological
improvement in the prisoners. Public performance of these
programmes gives the jail inmates a sense of dignity and
sensitizes the community about the so far neglected section of
people .
