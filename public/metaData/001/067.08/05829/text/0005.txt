the time now, 1 believe, is suitable to work on the greatest
Indian literary genius, Rabindranath Tagore-a person who
applied his mind to the Indian social problems of his time and
when these took the shape of literature, his magic touch at
once enabled him to move out from the circumference to the
centre, seizing the entire context in terms of universality. From

a very early stage of my career, I have been closely in touch
with Tagore ’5 works, and have worked in productions such as
Visarjan. Rabindranath Tagore-a name synonymous with
Bengali culture-has always been a source of inspiration for
me. The philosophical depth and emotional attachment with
humanity which characterizes his works, have greatly
influenced me and my works. Having decided to work on
Tagore, I could not but select ‘Chandalika’- the story of an
untouchable girl. The theme, at once struck me as one that

can still be identified with, in a society in which the Dalits and
their miseries remain to be a burning social issue. And at the
same time it would be a pleasure to arrive at something new
by following the theme 'of Tag ore’s Chandalika and re—shaping
it in our own way.
