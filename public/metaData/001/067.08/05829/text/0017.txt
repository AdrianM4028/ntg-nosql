forced to return. The mother, in spite of her apprehensions, is coaxed
into submission by her affection for her daughter. The spell succeeds
in steering Ananda’s passions but when he returns for Prakriti, the
sensitive girl realizes at once that she had fallen in love with Buddha’s
pure disciple and not the soulless body of a youth under a magic
spell that now approaches her-the light and radiance, the shining
purity and heavenly glow that had made her to adore him was
now no more. Filled with remorse, she begs her mother to take

back the spell, knowing that it would cost her mother’s life. The
mother dies, the spell is lifted and the repentant Prakriti, now fully
conscious of the dignity of womanhood, is redeemed by her
willingness to renounce her love for the sake of Ananda, who forgives
her while chanting the name of Buddha.
Tagore, in this play, posits not only love ’3 manifold forms,
creating a conﬂict verging on violence, but also the action in multiple
polarities of 20th C India torn with conﬂict of religion, gender, caste,

spirit and matter, and captures a universal search for love and peace
through equality and self-knowledge. And ‘Chandalika’-written in
1933 - remains as relevant as it was then, when we consider the

social, political and religious conflicts that plague society even in

the let C India and the world at large with various forms of
discrimination ruling the global scenario.
