studying individUals and his experience with the boatman
Phulchand or the dacoit Rupchand,whom he had offered to guide
to the good way of life, supplied him with enough materials for
literary creation.He could hear a philosopher in the simple talk of
the domestic Gaffoor.The lyrics of Gagan Harkara impressed him
greatly and he picked up Gagan’s tunes for his own songs. The
literary interest of Suniti Sancharini Sabha ,a local group,was
appreciated by him but he found the execessive display of loyalty
by some to be utterly distasteful. Obviously Indira enjoyed reading
Rabikaka’s letters, full of such fascinating details.

It is a commendable job on the part of Sayead Shamsul Haque to
script the play, Banglar Mati Banglar Jol by carefully collecting
materials from Chhinnopatra,the letters.

Usha, I have tried to put all the points of the synopsis in the translated
ve rs ion . also added a few words of appreciation for the
playwrightsending the revisions on Totakahini writing.

Director’s Note
The play is about Rabindranath’s long and close association with
rural nature ,the script drawing mostly from his own words in the
letters .The protagonist obviously is Rabindranath himselflt is a
challenge for the director to bring forth such a compendious
production‘with thirty five performers on stage taking part in dance,
song, recitation and link narration. No doubt it has been successful
for the dedicated efforts of a group of young and committed talents.
