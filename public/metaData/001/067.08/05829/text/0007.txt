BISARJA N
Directed by :
SUMA N MUKHERJEE

D irector’s Note
“Sin has no meaning in reality. To kill is but to kill, - it is neither
sin nor anything else. Do you not know that the dust of this
earth is made of countless killings? Old Time is ever writing
the chronicle of the transient life of creatures in letters of blood”.
- This is a line from the play that triggered me. I cherished the
dream to do ‘Bisarjan’ since a long time. The upsurge of
violence in the contemporary times and the bloody reality we
are living in provoked me and connected me to ‘Bisarjan’ . It is
a grand narrative of our times where blood is not a metaphor;
it is real blood that leaves its stains on everything.
