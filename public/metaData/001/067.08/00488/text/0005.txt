The Play

\ In Mahashweta Devi's 'RUDALI' now dramatized by
Rangakarm'ee through a long workhop exercise (involving advisor Sri Samik Bandyop‘adhyay, a group of
playwrights Sri Partha Banerjee, Sri Subir Mukherjee,

Sri Samar Chatterjee, Director Smt. Usha Ganguli and
member of the cast Sri Narendra Roy). Sanichari,
somewhere in South Bihar, sees her family breaking

up, poverty and hunger and desperation taking their
toll, till she comes across Bhikhni, an old friend, now
abandoned by her family. The two form a partnership
for survival, and master an unusual profession, ’conducting’ the elaborate larnentation as part of the death
ritual for the rich dead, mobilizing a company of mourners and building up a rich ceremonial for the mourning,
till it is a sure 'buy' with all the feudal rich, who are too
busy anyway with their devices and inheritance fights
to have time to mourn for their dead. The new profession gives the two rniddleaged women their first sense
of independence and mastery, and when they go to
recruit in the red light district, Sanichari discovers her
long lost daughter-in-law, Parvatiya', with whom she
can now relate on different terms. But when Bhikhni
goes on a visit to her family, and dies of food poisoning,
and Sanichari has to Conduct all by herself a particularly big ceremony of mourning, she feels exhausted
and cannot bring herself to take her fee at the end of it
all.
