DIRECTOR’S NOTE
Rabindranath Tagore has occupied an important place in my thoughts all through my career of
acting and direction in theatre. I came to be associated with his works through participation, as
the main female character, in Gharebaire, Streer patro, Kach—o—Debjani and Bisarjan and in
dance dramas Notir Puja and Barshamongol. My attempts at translating Chandalika and
Bisarjan and some songs of Tagore brought me closer to his philosophy, particularly to his
awareness ofthe myriad emotions ofhuman mind and concern for the oppressed.
I always aspired to work on him but could not muster up courage as I felt that to maintain the
height reached by a genius like Rabindranath in his works by subtle handling of feelings and
situations would be a too difficult task for me to accomplish. However, my experience of thirty
four years with stage and scripts instilled confidence in me
and I dared take a plunge.
As a part of the Tagore's 150th birth anniversary
celebration my group Rangakarmee launched the
project of Rabindra Rangayatra and initially with two
home productions Chandalika and Manasi I decided to
pay my tribute to the poet.
In Manasi I tried to work on Tagore's women with a
storyline that places his women characters in the
context of contemporary life. I have chosen characters
from his novels who have a strong will power and may
stand out as rebels in a patriarchal world. The script
also brings out the intricacies of the actor-director
relationship. To enhance the total aesthetic effect of
the production live songs have been added and
copies ofTagore's paintings of women have been
placed on stage as the backdrop. The faces on the
paintings hold a key to Tagore's concept of
women.
Working on Tagore has been a challenge and at
the same time an enriching experience for me.
