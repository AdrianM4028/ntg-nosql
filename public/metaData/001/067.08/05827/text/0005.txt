ABOUT THE PLAY
With great reverence to Rabindranath Tagore,
Rangakarmee is going to produce a play
comprising of major women characters taking
from Tagore’s literature with their discursive
stand, philosophy, emotion and the story
narrative. It is a project not only to present
Tagore but also to expose some revelations
about the status of modern women in our
society.

The structure of this play is framed in terms of
“dialogue” between a student—actress and the

director. Our actress is becoming Ela ofChaar
Adhyay, Kurnudini ofJogajog, Sudarshana and
Surangana of Raja and Mrinalini of Stree’r
Patra.

Director intends to construct a character

through

a discussion which leads

to

dramatisation of the underlying storyline.
Eventully characters become free to talk
among themselves. In turn the play will try to
ignite th

ic and emotion in such a

and director are out of
aracters framed by
enters into the personal
3 of today’s womenfolk to capture
ini, Mrinalini and others. This
ts to address Tagore’s ideas on
analysed from the angle of
omplexities ofour time.

As a format, this project is a new kind of
theatre that clubs idea with event, narrative
with treatment, statement with histrionics.
Stage craft must be designed to highlight the
inner dimensions ofTagore’s philopsophy by

projecting Tagore’s drawings.
Rangakarmee intends to present radiant
theatre not to show the godhead of
Rabindranath Tagore but to explore how in
present age we can accomplish the task of
translating essence ofTagore into our theatre
in a deconstructed framework ofour time.
