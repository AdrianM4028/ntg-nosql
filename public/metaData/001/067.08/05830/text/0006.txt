Visa ri a n
Visarian directed by Habib Tanvir (bn.
1923), one at the country's rnaior direc-

tors, as a joint production by his own group
Naya Theatre and Rangakarmee, Kolkata,

is a major theartrical event commemorat-

ing thirty years of the colour‘lul career of

the Kolkata - based Hindi theatre gowp. Actors lrom the Kolkata gr0up, mainly from
the city itself, have the rare opportunity of

interacting with the seasoned folk actors
of Chhattisgarh, who have contributed so

significantly to the highly original theatrical

style associated with

Tanvir.

Directorially, Tanvir takes a fresh look at

Rabindranath Tagore’s play Bisarian (’Sac‘
rifice’, 1890), raising fundamental ques-

tions about the violence inherent in traditional religious rituals nurturing the streak
of cruelty into the rigidity of religious intolerance. Acutely‘conscious of the re-

newed relevance of the play in the mod-

ern context, Tanvir seeks to give his work
a wider locus by working with two groups,
widely separated in their locations; by re-

taining Tagore's original songs in Bengali
in their original tunes (as composed by
Tagore); by letting the people in the com-

munity scenes speak in Chhattisgarhi.
