In 1991-92

we

Shows in a month in

have

performed

approx

8

Packed houses which is a

boost to the Hindi Theatre.

We are regularly staging our shows in Calcutta
and suburbs 4-5 times in a month and we
are the only Hindi group theatre who is
staging regularly their shows in a non hindi
speaking state, and we have created a regular
audience also here.
Inspite of limitedness of our audience, because
of language problem, we are staging regular
onslaught
shows countering the incessaint
of commercial Hindi cinemas and cheap hindi
theatre production of dubious nature.
