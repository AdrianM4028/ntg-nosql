theâ€”story
Dr. Kashinath Singh is not a new name in
the world of Hindi literature. Born in
Jianpur village ( now Chandauli ) of
Varanasi, he has been successful in

giving live sketches of the life in Varanasi
in his stories. His dialects appear more
as a dialect in normal conversation filled
with witty humour and sarcasm than a

successful juxtaposition of intellectually
refined words, as is the practice in
present day Hindi literature. Dr. Singh
had been teaching at B.H. U. from 1964
till 1996, and has been visiting fellow at
many universities. Kashinama is based
on the story Pande Kaun Kumati Tohe
Lagi written by Dr. Kashinath Singh.
