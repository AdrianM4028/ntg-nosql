(onstage) and the reasons for their justification, the
character and the atmOSphere have not been made to fit
into the rigid frame work of plays ( as done conventionally
on Stage) ; but keeping the point of self realisation in
mind, the stage and the auditOrium have been used fully.
Considering a part of the Stage, the auditorium has been
used by the artiste to depict the long distances traversed
by them.

The Script has mentioned that to depict real life incidents
in a realistic manner, the atmosphere should not be
aided by real sets, but the characters themselves should
becomes doors, windows etc. as and when necessary.
Even raging fire should also be symbolically depicted by
using red and yellow coloured rolls of cloth.

Musical effects are created by using property such as
containers, stones, handi, chirnta, thali etc. The musical
tone should be raw (Folk-like) rather than being melodious.
