LO K- KA TH A
IT’S SIGNIFICANCE
Nobody would believe that the oppression against the
major part of the society will Suddenly come to a halt

after 42 years of Independence.
Though talks and
discussions about it keep crOpping up now and then,
experience tells us that ministers and other public servants
have really done little to stop such Oppression. The socalled representatives of the people are merely interested
in securing political gains from issues of Social injustice.
In the previous 42 years, big talks and tall promises of
social justice have been made while the real issues have
been pushed further and further into neglect. It is also
sad that

innumerable incidents of

rape

and

violence

against the Oppressed of the society have failed to inspire
the masses to raise their voice and hands in protest.

No God or saint can suddenly appear to change this
repressive situation. It is common peOpIe like us who have
to take-up cudgel against social wrongs.

But now often

do we bother to do so ? Writer Ratnakar Matkari make-us '
question ourselves in his play "LOK - KATHA” and jalt
us into realizing the significance of our silence.
The play successfully captures the sordid reality of
today’s Rural Indian Society and the importance of our
active protest.

Rangakarmee’s “LOK-KATHA” is

in tact

the live potroyal of the ‘rustic-realism’ of our beloved
native land—India as it istoday.
Play adjudged BEST
PRODUCTION ’87-88’ by W. B. Govt. and till day it has
been staged 80 times.
