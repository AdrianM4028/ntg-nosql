A Court Martial, presided over by Surat Siugh,
goes into the case of Jawan Ramchandar accused of
shooting down an officer, Captain Mohan Verma, and
wounding another officer, Captain Kapoor.
The

'extenuating circumstances’ are not considered adequate to grant the accused a reprieve, and he is duly

sentenced to death. But what is revealed in the course
of the trial in the harrowing tale of an excellent soldier
and Sportsman, born a low caste, driven by continuous

humiliation and deprivation to take the deSperate step i
of attacking Captain Kapoor, Whose crimes against
humanity loom large in the evidence that accumulates ३

in the case. The power and the facade of faceless
discipline that characterize the

military ' order - that ‘

almost constitutes a State in itself sever up a subtea- है
ranean system

that nurtures

the

crudest kind of

patriarcly, rank egotisrn, caste prejudice and vulgar
sexism

The pilling up the evidence ’ has the force

to drive Captain Kapoor to commit suicide -… and vindi-

cate the justice the presiding officer-Surat Singh had
been pursuing so humanely and yet infructuously.
