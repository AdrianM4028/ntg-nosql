ABOUT THE PLAY_:

When one is denied the respect due to a man only for the reason that he is borne
.
by 'Iow-caste' parents, the offence can not simply be termed as a social violence
It assumes the proportion of a crime against human kind. Yet by the turn in
situation murderer becomes a winner whereas the victim is unforgiven. The culprit
may receive the severe punishment at the hands of the law but, in fact, it is the

society which is put in the dock.
The Court Martial, written by Swadesh Deepak, is the story of a recruit Ram
Chander who is tried for murdering one of his officers and injuring another. The
Court Martial is presided by a war-veteran Col Surat Singh who has been a
witness to many ‘Iife-and-death’ situations. But this trial puts him in a queer
position so far unknown to him and during the course of interrogation he realises
that the issues at stake are much larger tht meets the eye. Realising that the lndian
Army is the only government agency in which reservation on caste basis is not
permissible, the Court Martial presents a combination of legal and poetic justice.
