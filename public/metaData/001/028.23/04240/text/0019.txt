His energy and enthusiasm was unbelievable. To those who d idn 't know
him, it was difficult to believe that he had suffered from a severe stroke.
But this did not deter him from striving to strengthen IPTA or singlehandedly trying to transform and upgrade his native village, Mijwan in
Azarngarh U.P. He would haunt, harass and convince officials and
politicians in Lucknow and Delhi to bring necessary amenities to his
village. For the last twenty years of his life Kaifi Azrn i lived in M ijwan and
he transformed it from a vi llage in oblivion to a model village. It now has
three schools, a maternity wardand a Computer Training Centre.
Kaifi .went down fighting till the last for all the causes which he fiercely

supported in his life, in his work and in his art.
