Magar Iikhvaaye koi usko khat, to hum se likhvaaye
Hui subaha, aur ghar se kaan par rakh kar qalam nikle
But if someone wants to write her a letter, they can ask me,
Every morning I leave my house with my pen on my ear.

Ye khalish kahaan se hotee i0 iigar ke paar hota

Mohabbat mein nahin hai farq jeenay aur marnay ka
