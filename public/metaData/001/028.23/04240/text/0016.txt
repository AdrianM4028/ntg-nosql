The Indian People's Theatre Association was formed
during the Quit India Movement in 1942. Upon its
formal inauguration in 1943-44, l PTA took upon itself
the challenge to bring theatre to the people with the
objective of building awareness about social
responsibility and national integration. IPTA soon
became a movement and swept the length and
breadth of India with its socialistic and nationalistic
fervour.
Born as a result of a long-felt need among writers and
artistes, IPTA brought about a sea of change in the
prevalent concepts about Indian Theatre. It was
formed to co-ordinate and to strengthen all
progressive tendencies that had so far manifested
themselves in the form of drama, songs and dances. Its
roots lay in the cultural awakening of the masses of
India, seeking to revive the cultural heritage of the
country.

IPTA was founded by stalwarts like KA Abbas, Dr.
Bhabha, Anil de Silva, Ali Sardar Jafri and Dada
Sharrnalkar. Over the last six decades many
prominent artistes, writers,

musicians,

directors,

dancers and singers have been a part of IPTA. These
include Arnar Shaikh, Shambhu Mitra,
Krishanchander,

Kaifi Azrni, Majrooh Sultanpuri,

children's theatre wing, which staged plays with
young artistes from different socio-economic
backgrounds.
