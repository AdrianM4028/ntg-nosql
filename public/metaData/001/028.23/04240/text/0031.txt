Hamid said, “You burn your fingers when you make
rotis. That is why I bought it. ”
The old woman's temper disappeared. She could not
say anything for her love was silent and full of
tenderness. How he must have suffered seeing others
buying toys, but he only thought of his old
grandmother. Ami na's heart was too full for words.
And then a very strange thing happened, stranger than
the part played by the chirnta. Hamid the child was
now playing the role of Hamid a man. And the old
grandmother Am i na became Am i na the little girl. She
broke down. She spread her dupatta and prayed for
Allah's blessings for her grandchild. Large tears
dropped from her eyes while Hamid comforted her.
How was Hamid to understand what was going on
inside her!
