audience i.e. children. While doing so, actual reactions from children
would automatically come. For this reason production of the play is
made very flexible. Designs are very light so that you can perform it at
any place and can cover couple of schools in a single day. Main
emphasis is to reach target audience - Children!
It has been learnt that theatre is being introduced in Schools
curriculum, so that theatre would come out from extra curriculum garb
to regular courses. What is the role of NSD in this plan?
It is a matter of great pleasure that NSD has played an important role in
this effort. Goa is the first state in the country where dramatic art has
been made compulsory. NSD has trained the teachers of Goa.
Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh are also coming up with similar plans.

We have TIE in our campus and along with it Children Theatre experts.
Even then Sh. Mohan Agashe is invited? Any specific reasons?

Yes! The valid question is that, who are doing children theatre
continuously. We have preconceived notion that children plays are
child's play. But the situation is just opposite. As far as Mohan Agashey
is concerned, lnspite being on the responsible post of Director - FTll
(Pune) and a busy actor; he is working for children theatre for last
25-30 years. I hope that our this effort with him would be successful.
