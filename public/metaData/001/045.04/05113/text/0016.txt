Author's Note
Mumbai saw a spate of communal riots following the horrifying bomb blasts in
1993. The play Pan Arnhala Khelaychay (Par Hame Khelna Hai) is based on
the events that occurred in a school in a cosmopolitan locality in Mumbai. The
play attempts to portray the changes taking place in the mental outlook and
attitudes of the students belonging to different communities in this school prior to, during and after the riots. This play might have a particular
significance given that, it is the first original Indian Grips play in terms of both
theme and the scope of its social perspective.

One expects that any performance of the play will be based on a perspective
that is born of understanding and balance, from both the director and the
actors. The reason for this expectation is, that the play handles particularly a
sensitive issue.

As | write this preface, it is only 15 days since the terrifying terrorist attacks in
the USA. The sounds of a potential world war are all around. We are
constantly witnessing the deaths of innocent citizens and the horrifying
spectacle of great suffering and loss. Against this background there will no
doubt be many attempts to bring about world peace. I hope that those efforts
will be supported by this as well as other plays and performances.
