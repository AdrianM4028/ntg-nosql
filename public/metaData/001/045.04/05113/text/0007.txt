Theatre has been introduced? What were the reasons and inspirations
behind it?
Look! we have two repertories; one NSD Repertory company,
established in 1 964 other one is Theatre In Education; popularly known
as TIE, established in 1988. TIE is trying to do plays for children by
adults. Firstly actors took the membership, their training completed
simultaneously. But' today gradually people are taking childrenâ€™s
theatre as a profession. Since long we have the concept to introduce
children theatre in our curriculum as specialisation. Now the effort has
been made. Concept is that, during three years minimum one
production related with children theatre should be the part of course. I
hope that through this, third year students would gain some
expenence.

Is it only an experiment or would it take a permanent place in the
syllabus?
One might hope that children theatre would take permanent place in
the curriculum. Only our education committee approval is needed. It
would be decided in the next meeting. As during three year course
studentstake part in classical or folk plays likewise participation in
children's play would be made compulsory.
What is the aim behind it? To make shows in schools or otherwise?

Certainly, our aim is to make shows in schools in order to target right
