Dr. Mohan Agashe

Though a psychiatrist by profession, Mohan Agashe's reputation as a stage
and film actor has been immortalised by his outstanding performance as the
'Machiavellian Nana Phadnavis' in the Marathi musical-GHASHIRAM
KOTWAL. Winner of many awards including the Padma Shri, Dr. Agashe
spearheaded Grips theatre in India, and followed its progress from a crosscultural experiment to its ultimate acceptance as a valid theatre form of
children's theatre in India.

Director's Note:
After successfully adapting many plays of GRIPS THEATRE-BERLIN,
Shrirang was after writing & directing original play from children's point of
view, relevant & rooted in our realities. The original Marathi production of
'Par Hame Khelna Hain' premiered at Prithvi Theatre, Mumbai in November'
96, proved that Shrirang had done it and had fully imbibed the thought &
process of 'GRI PS TH EATRE'.

l was so impressed with the production, that ред wanted him to do it in Hindi so as
to reach wider audience. I even got it translated. When offer came from NSD
to produce it as final year student's production, I accepted it and Shrirang
agreed to help. With his help, l have tried to recreate the experience one had
while doing the play in Pune, for the theatre lovers in Delhi. I owe a lot to
Sh ri ra ng .

He succeeded in raising pertinent social & human questions in the most
playful manner.
