KANNADA-BHARATI ENDOWMENT FUND
-—Uday L. Joshi
On 1 st February, 1968, in the early hours
of that mist-laden morning news came to us
of the sudden death of Lakshman Joshi. He
had died in an accident. His death has left
a void in K'annada-Bharati which will for

ever remain so.
He was a pillar of strength to the organization; he spread a message of conﬁdence
wherever he moved; his geniality was infectious; his zest for life knew no bounds.
Always smiling, bubbling with enthusiasm
even in the thick of worries, undaunted in
spirit and at all times a dependable friend—
that was Joshi.
On that fateful day he sat in the car that

was to take him to his place of duty (AIR),
but God had willed it differently. The car
took him to his ultimate destination. Joshi
traced his entity with the Maker. He rests
in eternal peace.

KANNADA-BHARATI deeply mourns
Joshi’s passing away, a loss as immeasurable
as it is tragic.
Lakshman Joshi has left behind Shrimati

Joshi and Master Uday Joshi (6), besides
thousands of friends and well wishers, to
mourn his passing away.

With a view to providing some support
to Master Uday Lakshman Joshi when he
comes of age—whether for his education or

for a better start in life—Kannada-Bharati
has started an ENDOWMENT FUND in
the name of UDAY L. JOSH]. A Savings
Account has been opened in the Canara
Bank Ltd., Janpath, New Delhi for this
purpose. and all contributions and donations
received for the Endowment Fund shall be

credited to this Account. The beneﬁts of the
FUND will be made over to Master Uday
L. Joshi after he attains majority. This is
a poor and humble token of return to the
memory of one who did so much to Kannada
and Kannada-Bharati within the short span
of a few years.
Kannada-Bharati requests all friends to
send their contributions and donations for
the FUND either in cash or by cheque drawn
in favour of “Kannada-Bharali Endowment

L AK SH MA N JOSH l

Fund—Uday L. Joshi” as early as possible.
Ofﬁcial receipts will be issued as and when
contributions are received. and names of
contributors will be announced in the subsequent brochures. Please help a promising
bud to blossom and bloom.
