I
(

The play is based on the Bengali novel
by the same name which
is part of a trilogy by the Gyanpeeth award
winner Smt Ashapoorna Devi.
The background of the play is early 20th
Bengal which is at the
of the Swadeshi and reformist movement.
Within this the play
highlights the moving struggle of a woman
-Suvarnalata, caught in the
web of a large conventional joint family
after marriage.
It portrays
her unrelenting fight to be allowed a
little freedom to read, to make
friends, to be a part of the national
movement, to venture out and for
a small little open space which can be
her window to the outside world.
Does she succeed ? Does the strong hold
of the traditional Bengali
family allow her the space she desires
?
Will her struggle at all
impact upon the generations of women that
follow her ?
