Prince Jauna who styled himself Mohammad bin Tughla
q is a towering figure in
medieval Indian history and has been. at
least in the eye of posterity. more sinne

than sinning. Tughlaq stunned his conte
mporaries by his strange political doctr
ines and
religious disciplines. He has baﬁie

readings show the enigmatic man
that Tughlaq was.

Ed.

No ruler in medieval India
has evoked
so much discussion concerning
his policy and
character as Mohammad Tughla
q. Muslim
chroniclers, without exception
, describe him
as a blood-thirsty tyrant
and severely
condemn his various measures.
It has also
been held by many modern
historians, that
he was a blood-thirsty
tyrant almost

verging on

insanity, whose policy ruined

the Sultanate of Delhi,
In recent times,
however, some reputed
historians have

challanged this almost universal
belief of both
scholars and laymen and sou
ght to exonerate

his character. The truth, as
usual, perhaps
lies midway between the
two extremes, and
Mohammad Tughlaq’s cha
racter was probably a mixture of opposites
.
It must be

admitted that he had many goo
d qualities of

head and heart, while his cruelties
were shocking and horrid, and he showed
a capricious

temper and a sad lack ofjudgeme
nt and cornmonsense on many occasions
.
Mohammad Tughlaq possessed
in a remarkable degree some traits
of character
which distinguish a good king
.
The Sultan had a very high moral
character
and was immune from most
of moral lapses
which characterized the rulers
of the middle
age. He abstained from dri
nking and was
very strict in his relation wit
h women. He
forbade the use of intoxicating
liquor among
his subjects and on several
occasions issued

orders that no woman shOUId
be permitted

to remain in the mili
tary camp.
