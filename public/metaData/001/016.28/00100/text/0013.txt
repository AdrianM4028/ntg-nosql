well in the estimate of readers, both general

handling the subject matter. The status of Mohammad as a king and the

abnormalities of his temperament offer
wide scope to study human behaviour
from different angles. The imagina-

tion of Mohammad is obsessed with
concept of sovereignty because it
gives full freedom to act according
to his idealistic whims. But his very
freedom to act comes to grips with
his fate which is revealed in his own
Violent nature.
It seems that his
intention is to discover and construct
a moral order which would explain
his mode of life. As the play pro-

gresses he meets his own anti-self in
Aziz, a washerman who parodies the
moral state created by Mohammad
and reverses it into a state of evil.

This climactic moment in the play
brilliantly dramatises a bond of duplicity between Mohammad and Aziz. A
strangely distorted love joins the two,
the sovereign and the criminal, the
idealist and the rogue.
