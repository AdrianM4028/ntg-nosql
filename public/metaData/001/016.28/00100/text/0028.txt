of Mohammedan law) live in the Kiosk, and

Sultan was worsted, he ordered for a second
sitting of the Muftis, so that he might come

to point out an error in the King’s argument

led to an immediate punishment of the
culprit, and contrariwise, on the Sultan’s
failure, the prisoner was let off the same

knows not, was adopted to give relief to the
people, or it had any other objective.
