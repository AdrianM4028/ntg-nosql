Dear Reader,

Kannada-Bharati was to have produced ‘Mohammad Tughlaq’ over three months ago, in
October last,

But, it could not be done as the grave national situation at that time turned

our minds on topics other than literature and play-production.

After the repeat Show 0f

‘Macbeth’ last April we have not been able to present any programme till now and we owe an
apology to you for this. However, there is this satisfaction that not a day has been wasted

by Kannada-Bharati in its book production prOgramme and the volume ‘Shakespearige
Namaskara’, great in content and striking in from, is on its way out. We hope to
release the
book on the coming Ugadi day. Another event of this year worth recording is Kannada-Bharati’s
trip to Bombay to produce ‘Macbeth’ at Rabindra Natya Mandira, Bombay, at the kind invitatio
n
of the premier local organization, Kannada Kala Kendra.

The production which took place in

November 1965, not only established a major link between the two sister organiza
tions but also
opened up a new avenue for the fulﬁlment ofcornmon aims and ' objects
through mutual contact
and coordination. The encouragement and guidance Kannada-Bharati has
been receiving from
eminent patriarehs in Karnataka like Dr. D.V. Gundappa
will for ever be a source of strength
and inspiration, Also a point ofjubiliation to note is that three
non-Kannadiga artistes, who
are in Tughlaq’s cast, acquired some rudiments of Kannada
in their keenness to participate the
Kannada-Bharati’s play-production.

We have in our future programme a major music functi
on with a view to bringing out
Karnataka’s contribution to music, both Hindustani
and Karnatak music, vocal as well as instru-

mental.

For this and for many other programmes that are in the
ofﬁng, Kannada-Bharati needs
your helping hand and a kind word of encouragement.
