Over there we can see men coming
Whom He is forced to relinquish their women
And coupled with blondes in their place.
It’s no good their cursing and praying.
For once he catches them racially straying
He’ll whip them bacle into Race.

With this Bertolt Brecht begins the ninth scene
of his Fear and Misery of the Third Reich. A
span of nearly forty years separates this

individual scene entitled The jewish Wife
premiered in Paris in 1938, with Helene Weigel
in the title role, and Ulrike Meinhoff
performed by Franca Rame in 1977. The
location in Germary is not the only common
point between the two plays. What they share
actually is the theme of the daily persecution of
women. The persecution is subtler in the
former; where the husband is prepared to drop
the wife when her presence threatens his
security. The wife ’s reaction too is colder in its
sense of hurt pride and wounded confidence.
The persecution takes on a direct political
dimension in the latter; where it assumes

terrorizing violence. The woman’s reaction too
is more demonstratively defiant. Even as the
story of everyday Fascism in Germany
continuing into our own times relates the two
plays, they both suggest otherforms of violence
directed against women, instigated and
institutionalised by the State, and the needfor
resistance against such violence. Both Brecht
and Franca Rame raise the theme of violences
against women above and beyond the privacy
of man-woman relationship into the sphere of
politics.
