Rame’s larger view ofpolitics covers home - life
of the working woman in Waking Up, thefirst
play of this triptych, in which the heroine,
sucked up into the routine ofpreparing to go to
work, loses her hearing altogether; opening a
comic variant of the same old story tragically
unfolded in the two other plays. In todays
modern world it is so diﬂicultfor an ordinary
working person to keep pace in the race of life.
In Subah, Maya represents such an ordinary
factory worker; who in the rnechanised life
around her; has herself become so mechanical
that unknowingly she goes through her routine
ofpreparing to go to her duty and creating a
chaotic situation for herself which ends up in
utter desperation and confusion. Rame’s
Walking Up (Subah) deals not only with the
material confrontation of the classes that rule
and are ruled but goes deeper into the
subconscious which is also gradually going
into the grips of the rulers of the economic
world. Because the economy of a nation rules
the society and the guardians of this economy
are todays matters.
