fTheatre workers in Calcutta remember the killing of
Prabir Dutta at an open air performance of a street

play in the Curzon Park in the early seventies and the
case of the eminent actor and director who refused to
be party to the protest on the ground that he refused
to accept the proposition that the police could beat a

person to death in prison or on the street, for

accepting that amounted to denying the entire system
of law and order.
Franca Rame’s play Ulrike Meinhoff closes on hate
directed against the irnbecility of the killers and those
who sustain them by their silence. India has had a

fairly long and shameful record of such irnbecility that
Rame makes her real target in her exposition of the

mysterious ‘suicides’ in prison ascribed to Baden,
Eustin, Raspe and Ulrike Meinhoff. Ulrike was the

first to be ‘found' dead while their trial was in
progress. When her co-accused requed to accept
the evidence offered for her ‘suicide’, and questioned

the legal process itself, all three of them were ‘found'
dead in prison. bringing the legal proceedings to an
end. When Rame staged this play first for the first

death anniversary of Ulrika Meinhoff in May 1977, the
Stamnheim trial was still continuing, and Ulrike’s
fellow accused were still putting up a brave fight.
