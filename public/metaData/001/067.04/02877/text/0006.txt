Fear and Misery of the Third Reich.
Nearly forty years separate this individual scene

entitled The Jewish Wife premiered in Paris in 1938,
with Helene Weigel in the title role, and Ulrike
Meinhoif performed by France Rame in Milan in
1977. The location in Germany is not the, only
common point between the two plays. What they

share actually is the theme of the daily persecution of

women. The persecution is subtler in the forrner,.
where the husband is prepared to drop the wife when .
her presence threatens his securlty. The wife’s
reaction too is colder in its sense of hurt pride and
wounded confidence. The persecution takes on a
direct political dimension in the latter, where it .

assumes terrorizing violence. The women’s reaction
too is more dernonstratively defiant. Even as the story
of everyday Fascism in Germany continuing into our
own times relates the two plays, they both suggest

other forms of violence directed against women,

instigated and institutionalised by the State, and the
need for resistance against such violence. Both
Brecht and

Franca

Rame

raise the theme of

violences against women above and beyond the ,

privacy of man-woman relationships into the sphere '
of politics.
