The Director

Bibhash Chakraborty (b. 1937), a Sangeet Natak

Akaderni awardee, came into prominence with two ,consecutive outstanding productions in the early

seventies—Hajrakta (1971) by Mohit Chattopadhyay

and Chakbhanga Madhu (4972) by Manoje Mitra._
While he has worked closely with directors like Ajitesh
Bandyopadhyay and Fritz Bennewitz, as associate and actor, he has directed a wide range of plays, for
his own group, Anya Theater, and other groups. His
1988 production, Madhab Malanchi Kannya, modelled

on lolk conventions, and telling fairy tale, has been ‘
one of the most popular Bengali productions even.
His work with Rangakarmee for Vama has been a
major departure for him.
