Rangakarmee, which had its inception in January
1976, spearheads the Hindi theatre in Calcutta today,
with seven productions on its live repertoire (three of
them completed hundred performances each). With
Mahabho] (1984), Lokkafha (1987), Hall (1989),

Vama (1990), Court Martial (1991), Rudali (1993),

Kho] (1994) and BetIAayee (1996) it has established
itself as a politically committed group, that delves into
forms of exploitation and oppression, political,

economic, and social and sexual; unravelling the
mechanisms at work, offering enlightenment at the
end. and never simplifying the issues into slogans or
solutions. Recognition has come to Rangakarmee in

the form of several awards, including the State
Government‘s award for the best production of the

year for four of its productions till date. Rangakarmee
has travelled extensively to different parts of the

country, to rural interiors and industrial suburbs spread
throughout the State, breaking language barriers and

reaching an audience that few theatre groups have
reached till now.
