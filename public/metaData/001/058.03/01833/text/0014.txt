The play is in the free style of our folk traditions. It is a musical tragi-comedy on the illusions and realities of

life. The play explores the relationships of man in the context of his family, neighbourhood and the society.
The play by using a format of rituals lays bare the meaninglessness of rituals which stifle growth. The play
raises questions about the compulsions and contradictions in life.
