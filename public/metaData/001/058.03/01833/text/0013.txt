SYNOPSIS :
'MHHHNIRVHN' written by the Marathi playwright Sh. Satish Alekar has been translated into Punjabi by
Mr. Joga Singh. This play is a spoof on death and all the werisorne rituals connected with death. In this
black comedy all the norms and values of society are being re—questioned. The narrative opens with the
death of Babuji, the patriarch of a Hindu family. He reappears in his "deathly" form to his wife Rama. It is
revealed through the story that the relationship between Rama and her husband has been far from
amicable. Both suspect each other of infidelity.
च

A scene depicting a ritual gathering of neighbours to mourn the death of Babuji has been organised.
Through this collection of people, human phychology is depicted in all its pettiness, meanness and superficiality. In the midst of this, Babuji's son Kaka arrives, who is anxious to dispose of the body of his father. On
hearing that the funeral grounds are closed Kaka starts looking at other possibilities of getting rid of the
body. This leads to various dramatic situations. At this point the play shifts from the level of realism to the
level of fantasy. In this illusions world , created by the 3 protagonists i.e. Babuji, Kaka and Roma ; all kinds of
debates and counter debates are generated, some metaphorical some philosophical and dealing with
half truth.
