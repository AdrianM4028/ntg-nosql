face of their desire is the some. Together, they all present 0 monolithic physicolity.

In this brief story-line we hove included some more stories which some way or other, belong to the some
theme. Hoving token 0 piece of the post, we hove tried to install it in the contemporory environment and
.Â» by doing wo we hove tried to bring to the surface the urge of the womon for emoncipotion; emoncipotion from oil the gruesome situotions of life. Where there ore songs and dances there ore innuendoes,
vulgor gestures, lustful looks and other bose octivities which are very much associated with such life styles
and which become the port of the necessary evils of the life of o prostitute. There is beouty ond the
sophisticoted user of beauty, the pros nourish some unexpressed and hidden desires for someone, there is
love, there is body, and the desires of the body. A lot of laughter is there, there ore quorrels, scuffles, there

the sorrow of the foding youth ond there is despise born out of the continuous dislike for the existence
which compels them to remain merely as commodities, as the objects of exploitation ond none else.
