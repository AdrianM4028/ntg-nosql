SYNOPSIS :
it is HHHNT—GHTHH (an eternal story) of the conflict between good and evil, evil emerging out of good,
ages after ages. A group of innocent people are enticed & trapped under the spell by the evil and later
shown a dream of heaven of progress and competition. But the innocence (Young girl) shows a direction

to the chorus to fight back dark shadows of evil.

‘

This dramatic-musical fable, in a fairy-tale atmosphere, is conceived in movements, shapes, colour-creating a new "space relations" on the stage.

DIRECTOR'S NOTE :
This is a parable. Essentially it is a conflit between "good and evil" - forces of manipulation and
innocence. The forces of manupulation also evolve out of us, here from the same group of players. The
"Daitya", which represents here the incarnation of exploitative manipulation, use all the tricks and techniques of getting followed by fear, by enticement, by’ manipulation, by getting them into routinized life
etc. The forces of innocence, symbolised here in a young girl, saves the group by showing them the
process of protection and the preservation of the humane qualities. The chorus here, of course, has a
passive role, however, it is positively guided by the forces of innocence. The "story ends in a typical fable
style of victory of positive forces of life.
