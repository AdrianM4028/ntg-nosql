A ritual is replaced by a
counter ritual.Modern myths
replace the ancient ones.
Basavanna's, social reforms
in Kamataka anewellknown.
The play presents the
struggles of social reformers against orthodoxy. When
you can't beat somebody in
an argument, the best way is
to punish him on a trumped
up charge. Basavanna is
accused of misappropriation
of funds and so leaves the
country of Bijjal. When tyranny is let loose, no yagna
can save a ruler as is seen in
this play. .

There is no single, uniform
style in the production. My
attempt has been to prove
the efficacy and power of
speech patterns. I have
largely used gestures from
the inexhaustible repertory
of human gestures.
MAHACHAITHRA is presented here in an expressionistic style.
