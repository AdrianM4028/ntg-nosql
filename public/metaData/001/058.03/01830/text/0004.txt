About the play

Using the concept of
metatheatre, a question
regarding the responsibility
of performers to the society is asked. A playgroup
goes around the country and
meets with disintegration
and debased values. The
'players' become mere 'spectators' to the things that happen around them. An individual who is self-centred is
a curse to the country. The
play is a reflection of the
contemporary social and political scene.

Director's Note

Music Pumanand Chari
Assistant SindhuRamchandran

My attempt is to give a
complete theatrical experience and not a mere delightful experience. To
achieve this I have fused
popular styles of Goa and
modern technique. Though
the theme is realistic the
performance, it is designed
that way, tends towards
symbolism.
