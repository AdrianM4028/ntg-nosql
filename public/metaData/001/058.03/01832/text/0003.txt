D | RE CTO R’S NOTE
Man's assurance in his powers, his sense of adventure
and indulgence, take him away from nature which
.
nurtures him. Even in his deepest peril, it holds the key to
the riddle of life. Exhaustless in creation, nature brings

forth new life to fulfil the destiny of man. This is the idea
projected in the play, based on a story by Viiay Dan
Detha .
