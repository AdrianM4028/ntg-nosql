The dances of the early period in Manipur centred round Shiva and
Parvati. Later, with the spread of the Vaishnava cult, Lord Krishna

became the p0pular deity and \the R35 Lila, the divine sport of Lord
Krishna in Brindaban, became the main theme of Manipuri dancing.

Manipuri dance is based on the ancient theory of dancing with a
difference that the dancer does not interpret the sentiments
expressed in the song through facial expressions and codiﬁed gestures.
The prevailing mood throughout the dance is Bhakti (devotion) and
the dancers are identiﬁed with the deities whose roles they play. To
a Manipuri dancer the movement of the body is the chief means of
expression. No matter how complicated the movements are, they
give an impression of rounded ease and poetic simplicity.

According to Manipuri legends Lord Shiva created the picturesque
valley of Manipur for his dancing. No wonder, song and dance
permeate the life of the Manipuris.
