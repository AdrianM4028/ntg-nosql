PLAY

This play apparently, is a story of the industrial disaster, due to
the absence of adequate preventive steps, corruption, inefficiency, politics and other such evils which are. an intergral part
of modern life. However the play also tries to portray declining
public standards of ethics and the value-system that is being
followed in the country. But in fact, it also attempts to convey the
message that honesty and sincerity on the part of those who are
handling industrial plants can save the loss of valuable property
and human life if they behave with so much devotion to their
work. The play also raises the concept in the modern context,
of good and evil.

"KUSHANKU" - rhyming with Trishanku is intentional. As the
protagonist of the play is in a dilernna at the crucial moment and
is held back by his own thoughts, where he is expected to act
upon.
Achyut Sarpotdar is a brilliant and hard working young engineer
working as a section head in a large public undertaking. He is
honest, sincere and fearless. He keeps noticing numerous
problems and mal-practices in the functioning of the Chemical
plant. He also tries to bring them to the notice of his superiors
and warns them about the possible disastrous consequences.
Due to lethargy, irresponsible attitude and also various vested
interests, no attention is given to his suggestions. A day comes
when a major leakage in this Chemical unit poses threat, not
only to the factory but also to the township nearby. Achyut
knows the solution, which would cost a few lives. Knowing it, he
does not dare to act on it. He hesitates to order his most trusted
men to risk their lives.

He explains the possible way out to Chowdhari (his assistant)
a mediocre engineer but a shrewd administrator. Chowdhari,
