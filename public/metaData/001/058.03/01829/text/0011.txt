According to Hindu mythology Jokurnar Swarny is considered
as the third son of Lord Shiva. In some rural areas of Karnataka
and Maharashtra it has been a tradition to worship Jokumar
Swarny which is pronounced as "Jokumar". Jokurnar Swarny is
worshipped by those women fold who are not able to conceive
a child, and is considered as "impotent". They believe that by
worshipping Jokumar Swarny they will be able to bear a child.
They worship Jokurnar Swarny on a full-moon day which is
known as "Jokurnar Swarny Pournima". They feed their husbands with a vegetable Snake-Guard (Padaval) which symbolises Jokumar Swarny's power.
