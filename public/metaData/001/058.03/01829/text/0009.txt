DIRECTOR'S NOTE

The Teatro of modern form originated from the Khell Teatro an
Open Air performance. The Khell Teatro has a traditional
fervour. Often the dialogues are not written nor books published
but the dialogues are externpore but highly relevant and concentrate on the central theme. However, with the passage of
time, Khell Teatr became so popular and started interacting with
audience whose taste was also undergoing a fast change due
to the process of transformation going around. The Khell Teatr
over the years developed into a modern stage as it would
happen anywhere. The teatro what we will see today is a
mode rn form with wonderful craftsmanship and with a message
that modernism can be achieved without a break from past and
the playwright has chosen a theme which envisages a conflict
between the agricultural occupation and tendency of youth
towards getting lighter employment of 'Baboos'.
The play ends with a note that traditional occupations need to
be revived as all job seekers cannot be absorbed by employ. ment. It is unfortunate that only after despair and frustration
switchtng over modern jobs that youths realise that the traditional occupations actually, of their own ancestors strengthen
their relations with the mother earth by returning to the plough.

The play has a touch of a sad note when the sister sacrifices for
her errant brother in the College, parting with the gold ornaments of her mother for better sartorials for him at the cost of her
own proposal for marriage. When the denouernent starts the
conversion starts of the misguided tarnin members and before
their return to the plough, the head of the family who does so
much pleading for the traditional occupation dies in despair
ending almost an era.
