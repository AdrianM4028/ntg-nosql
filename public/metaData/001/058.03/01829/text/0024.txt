PLAY

"SATYASHODHAK" alias "Joticharitra" by G. P. Deshpande is
in his own words, a modern "SATYASHODHAK JALASA".
In this play Jotibha's life history is being narrated not just for the
sake of theatre or hero-worship. The aim is to seek solutions to

the burning problems of the current epoch. That is why we turn
to the lives of great men. That is why we analyse their deeds and
thoughts. Jotiba's reforrnative activities proved a hindrance to
the ongoing traditionalists' dominance.
Jotiba has a clear vision of social dynamics and could very
easily spot the Iacunas and shortcomings of even the great
leaders. He did not spare them.
Jotiba wrote to awaken the self respect of the down trodden. He
has analyzed the nature and causes of the slavery of the downtroden in the Indian society in his book "S LAVE RY". He believes
that the religion has to be criticized not to demolish it, but to
reform. He will not shun using imaginary devices to do this. This
clarity of vision is also reflected in his analysis of the 1857
mutiny. He rightfully asserts that the defeat of the English in
1 857 would have resulted in power for the Mughuls in Delhi and
for Peshawas in Pune. Thus the rebels were not to hand over
power to very forces who were instrumental in bringing slavery
of the foreigners to this country.
