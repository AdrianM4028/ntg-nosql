PLAY

The Play 'Nikal' which is being presented at the Kala Academy
Festival is a finer product of traditional folk teatr in the local
Konkani language. The teatr form locally evolved from the Khel
Teatr has considerably undergone a vast change overthe years
with the interaction of the transformed audience and their taste.
The Nikal, with considerable finesse opens with a conflict in the
mind of a family devoted to the farming, with the traditional
occupations and meagre opportunities for the employment in
modern fields particularly with the Baboo mentality. Reginald
who is the head of the family is attached to the farming activity
while his members, the sons do not subscribe to his views and
would like to pursue the other occupations and the elder son
would like to go to Gulf countries for a fast buck. While Reginald
continues the occupation of agriculture with hand to mouth, his
daughter sacrifices her gold ornaments left behi nd for her by her
mother and satisfies her brother by offering better sartorials to
avoid rigging in the College. With the passage of time the elder

boy returns from Dubai without any success and frustrated for
not getting the job. The sister loses the proposal for marriage
and the boy in the college also does not contribute anything to
the family as his eyes are cast on employment in non traditional
occupation. But the family plunges into total disappointment
when the children of Reginald return with utter failure and are
converted finally to a view that their motherland is the only place
where they can ech out their living and their opinion about
traditional occupations also undergo a change for better. But ,

when this conversion process ends Reginald does not live so
long and dies without knowing that his children have come back
to the family with a changed mind.
