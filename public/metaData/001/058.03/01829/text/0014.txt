Sh ri YogeSh Sh ri niwas 80 man aged
27, with Diploma in Printing Technology and a graduate in Marathi
has so much taken keen interest in
acting and directing the stage plays.
His Jokumar Swarny presented in
this festival takes the audience in a
new world of the theatre context,
and the meaning.
Shri Soman is the President of the Institute of Sneh since last 7
years, worked as Associate Director with famous Mr. Satyadev
Dubey, authored 20, One Act Plays and equal number of full
length plays out of which 5 are being printed and published by
the Govt. of Maharashtra.

"Purshottam Karandak" written by Sh ri 80 man is recognised as
one of the most prestigious One Act Play and he himself has
acted in it, which has fetched hi m a prize as the best actor for and
also best director award for several years, in several competitions. Shri Soman deserves applause, for his is a difficult task
of giving identity to his plays. The present theme of the play
emanates from the border areas of two states where the
regional culture is divided between the two states of Marathi and
Kanada. However, Sh ri Soman and Joku mar Swarny both have
acquainted themselves very well despite all sorts of difficulties.
Jokumar Swarny mixes up the ancient with the modern on
account of which the play has become enjoyable and the credit
for which definitely goes to Shri Soman.
