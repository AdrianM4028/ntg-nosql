Important. It is because of relevance of theme to contemporary
needs it inspired him to drarnatise sacrifices for the performance.

In today's world where environmental pollution has become
important and is placed on the top of the world's agenda, where
people are aware and worried about felling of the trees in India,
Brazil and many other developing countries, where the new
generation is not concerned or only gives lip service, where for
the governments and many International agencies environmental pollution rnost of the times becomes a show business,
such a non-violence and tragic human sacrifice by a handful of
villagers of a remote village 250 years ago becomes very
significant for the society of today.
The style of the production is going to be realistic. The style of
pagri of different people, their costumes, the colour of the dress
of the women, jewellery, props of both men and women will be
of that particular period.
Of course the rich cultural heritage of Rajasthan, its full colour
and splendour, its folk music and dance will form an integral part
of the production.

The main purpose of the play is to show the human sacrifice of
the people of 250 years ago to the generation of today. To show
that how a handful of unarmed men and women sacrificed their
lives to save the trees, because they sincerely loved them.
