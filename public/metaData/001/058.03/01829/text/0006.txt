WEST
UDAIPUR
The West Zone Cultural Centre was set up in the year 1985 with
headquarters at Udaipu r to promote and foster national i ntegration among the regional cultures of this country. The West Zone

comprises of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat. The
mai n objective of the country's division into cultural zones marks
the first step in the direction of national integration. Its second

objective is to trace the cornrnonness of the coastal cultures of
India from Rajasthan to the State of Goa.

With this consideration in view, West Zone Cultural Centre
undertakes several schemes like cultural exchange and encouragement to children and adults alike in variety of forms of
performing as well as Fine Arts.

The West Zone Cultural Centres' great cu Iture-Odyssey called
Maru Se Sagar Tak will always be in the minds of the Goans as
it culminated in Goa after its fine performances in Panaji and
other places. The Cultural Centre apart from organising Bal
Melas also had organised Seminar and discussions on the
similarities and uniqueness of the cultures of these four states,
particularly in respect of the West Coast areas. The West Zone

Cultural Centres' contribution towards building up a kind of
composite culture of the west coast as well as its activities and

interactions with other zones defines a well laid strategy of India
to strengthen unity amidst diversity which is the tradition of this
country. The present festival of theatre is also organised with
this point in view and ensures push to a theatre movement with
encouragement to directors, writers and actors.
