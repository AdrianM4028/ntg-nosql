STORY :— Deewar Todni Hai is a story of two orphan boys,
Gubin and Mohan, Gubin is dumb. As the curtain opens, the two boys
are seen working in one corner of the stage to make their ends meet.
Simultaneously, in the opposite corner, a group of children are playing
with a ball, who belong to an elite class. To divide these two
circumstances, a curtain has been used. Now how these children of two
contrasting circumstances get introduced to each other, and how the
children who have had an elite background, realise the pain and grievances

of their poor counterparts, Gubin and Mohan; is what the play is all
about
