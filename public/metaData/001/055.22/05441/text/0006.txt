AAPAS K I BAAT
Probably

the

most 1 unique

American works.

combination

of

Russian

and

Neil Simon the noted American playwright

dramatises classic Chekovian short stories and strings them

together in a play called THE GOOD DOCTOR.

Hailed as

the brightest achievement when played at Broadway in the

late seventies, AAPAS Kl BAAT, the Hindi adaptation of The

Good Doctor is, relevant to all the classes and times and
stresses three elements that need i to be preserved for all

time — innocence, humanity and a little kindness which would

go a longway in creating a better World.

The play presents

various facades of life through six arresting episodes ——
comic, poignant, tragic and farcical.

Even as we laugh with

the characters, on the characters, the inherent truth of it
hits us long after we have left the theatre.
