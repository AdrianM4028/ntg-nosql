He is what every man and woman needs today — He isThe Rainmaker, a man who is hope itself... a virtue...
conditions ' prevailing

that is lost in the harrowing

today.When

American

playwright

Richard

Nash

wrote

The

Rainmaker, a fairy tale that is just as true as the droughtsthat hit our country, he must have placed it in a universal

setting.

80, it is, that this comedy of sentiments has every—thing in it to be cherished by all people of all ages.

Bajrang

adapts

itself

to

a

drought-stricken

Rang

Rajasthani village, where the focus is on a family headed by a windower—

father, his elder son l\/lahipat, who believes in hard—core facts and truths and dismisses dreams, the younger Padarnpat, who

is about to break into the world with a nascent approach; and Nandu, the 'ugly duckling’ whose marriage is the issue

around which the play revolves.

Into this dreary life enters Bajrang, a fascinating man. . . .

offers a deal to the family . . . . . . rain, in exchange for athousand
the

opposition

rupees.

To believe,

or is he a magician who

or

not

to

believe is the

dilemma of the family members,

and

oflVlahipat and the disillusioned Nandu are as strong as the

hopes of the father and Padampat.

it is a process of baring one’s mind and being absolutely transparent to yourself as

Bajrang begins to infuse new life into the hopeless Nandu.The next time she meets the local policeman who is riddled
with his own complexes of life, things are going to bedifferent.

Rang Bajrang solves the subtleties of life with a flourishthat leaves one refreshed and happy.
