Today Ank humbly boasts of over 1500 performances all
over the country with a vast repertoire of plays (listed
elsewhere in this booklet). In our moment of success, we
would be failing in our duty, if we do not acknowledge
the priceless contribution and encouragement of the Late
lVlrs. Jenifer Kapoor and Shri Shashi Kapoor at the Prithvi
Theatre, where Ank took its roots. Most of our productions,
which went on to play for record number of shows like
HAl MERA DIL (188), BEEWION KA MADARSAA (124),
KAMLA (78), JAAT Hl POOCTHHO SADHU Kl (73),
KHAIVIOSH ! ADAALAT JARl HAl (69), BAKI lTll-IAS (76)

The growing demand and enthusiasm for our plays that are
aimed at a professional, healthy and wholesome Hindi
theatre, has placed additional responsibilities on us and
encouraged us to work with greater zeal and zest towards
the solemn cause of theatre.
Yes, with Ank, theatre has
become a way of life.
We believe that Cinema is larger
than life and Television, smaller, it is only theatre which
is just life-like. And like life, theatre will also go on forever
for newer forms and bigger challenges. in Ank, we never
believe in arriving, it is to go on and on . реж . . . .
"Naqshaa uthake koi naya shahar dekhiye
ls shahar rnein to sabse mulaqaat ho gayi. .
And with this slogan we shall keep moving on to new
pastures, new horizons. . . .
