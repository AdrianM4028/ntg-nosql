Welcome dear Patron,

Once again it gives us immense pleasure to extend a hearty
welcome to all of you on the occasion of our EIGHTH
ANNlVERSARY.

Ank has over the years strived ceaselessly

for the cause of a healthy and wholesome Hindi theatre.
Your growing patronage has

been a great shot-in-the—arm

for our efforts, which saw us through a period of rapid

progress with festivals ranging from ONE WEEK in 1979

to 3 ONE MONTH last year.

This year, in keeping with

our new format of opening a new play for a longer period

of time, we present a unique classic mystery AAJ RATT,

being premiered for a record SIXTEEN shows.

YOu have enjoyed our comedies,

tragedies, contemporary

classics, musicals and other dramatic moments over the
years.

In AAJ RAAT we promise you a spellbinding enter-

tainer of a different kind —-— a mystery that is both engrossing

and thought—provoking.

We take our theatre Seriously with—

out denying you the fun of it.

Here’s wishing you all a

happy viewing and hope you enjby the show as much as

we enjoyed putting it up.

——

Ank.
