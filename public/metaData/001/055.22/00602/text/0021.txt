Bharatiya Kala Kendra
THE Bharatiya Kala Kendra is a product of post-independence cultural
renaissance in India. Starting modestly in 1952 as an organizer of music
festivals, and other similar shows—with an eye on entertainment—it has since

then developed into an institution for the development and promotion and
perpetuation of classical artistic forms.

The Kendra seeks to strive for redeeming art from neglect and decadence,
. and for adapting it to present-day requirements.
