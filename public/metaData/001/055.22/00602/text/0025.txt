Bharatiya Kala Kendra’s contribution to the revival and adaptation of
classical art forms, is modest, but it takes pride in the originality of its approach
and improvement of neglected forms of Art and bringing them to the layman
and the connoisSeur alike. The success of its experiment is its pledge for

undertaking new ones.
The Kendra has been allotted - a plot of land by the Government of India
where it is undertaking the construction of its own premises. This will go a long
way to enabling it to concentrate on its work.
Like any other institution devoted to art, the Kendra’s ﬁnances are
chronically short of its needs. It has full hope that members of the Kendra as
will as others interested in our country’s cultural renaissance will give their
support to the Kendra to enable it to build up a corpus which will lend ﬁnancial
stabliity to its experiment in Art and culture.
