Sankarabharana Ragarn

I, the maid with the lotus eyes, wait for my Lord.

I wait at the door casting my eyes on all sides in eager expectancy. की

for you.

When such beautiful moonlight casts a spell,

When I have a garland of jasmine ﬂowers
Scented water by my side to sprinkle on you,
Oh ! beloved where can you be ?
I wait and wait, and wait .... .,

THANA VARNAM

Panthuvarli Ragam

Kantajati Ata Talam

In a varnam, the singer alternates lines of poetry, which the dancer enacts, with
lines of musical sounds, which accompany m'rtta or pure dance. The meaning of
the words of the varnam is a f'ollows :

It is fair to be angry with me, Oh ! Lord ?
Oh ! Noble Lord, I bow to Thee
Love Thee, worship Thee
Here I sit to worship Thee,
Oh radiant Lord of the three worlds.
Great as Thou art,

I cannot cherish a desire for Thee
Nor hope to come closer to Thee.
Yet my love for Thee burns within me.

My love is fathomless as the deep ocean,
And my body thrills with rapture at the thought of Thee,

Oh ! Moon-faced One, kind of heart and sweet of tongue,
!
