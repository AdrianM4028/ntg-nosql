Conntry. In November last, it toured Nepal "on an invitation. In Jarnmu &
Kashmir, it was presented to our Jawans in the forward Areas.
\
Thus the Kendra does feel, that in their humble way they have been able to
take the art of dancing to the masses in Delhi and other parts of our country
through this “Ramlila” ballet.

CLASSICAL DANCE DRAMAS
For propagation of art forms, the Kendra has created several stage shows
based on classical styles. MALATI MADHAV, KUMAR SAMBHAV, SHANE-OUDH and DALIA are four dance dramas based on the Kathak dance
technique. These have been universely admired for the originality of adaptation
of this style of dancing to requirements of modern stage. The music of the
plays is of particular interest, with its classical colouring both in vocal and

orchestral aspects, and for the reflection of shifting moods and situation of the
play3 .
REVIVAL OF KA’I‘HAK
The Kendra takes pride in its revival of the Kathak dance and for bringing

out its immense potentialties as a vehicle for presentation of classical plays in
the form of dance dramas. Skilled foot-work and the beauty mime and gesture,

PUPPETRY
Another form in which the Kendra has striven to receive traditional arts,

is Puppetry. It has produced several successful puppet plays like PRITHVIRAJ
SANYOGTA, DHOLA MARU, JHANSI KI RANI & KRISHNA SUDAMA,
and continues to experiment with new forms of this technique. The Kendra has
developed craftsmen for manufacturing Puppets who have shown imagination
and skill in investing the puppets with live expression. They have invested th
puppets with motions of eyes. lips and wrists which were previously lacking, and
are experimenting with new approaches.
