PIYUSH MISHFtA
A graduate from National School of Drama, Piyush Mishra
is a Iegend-in-the-Making. His competence is not confined
' to any single area of theatre activities. More than a "WonderKing " as the media love to call him, he is as much inevitable
as a theatre activist known for his stress on what is healthy
and relevant for the world of theatre. He has won the
unconditional applause of theatre-lover's for his performance
in plays like Hamlet, Nekrassov, Man Equals Man,
Comedy of Terrors, Endgame, Galileo, Jab Shahar

Hamara Sota Hai, Holt and Yeh Jo Zindagi Hal Na.
He has been fountainhead of many adaptations of famous musicals and
classics in Hindi with original music and lyrics by him. These include West
Side Story, Blood Brothers, Dream of Peter Mann, Fiddler On the Roof,
The Time of Your Life and Payment as Pledged and SRC Repertory’s

play “Mahanirvan”. As if not satisfied by his own contribution to Hindi
' theatre, Piyush has offered original scripts like Gagan Damaama Bajyo,
Woh Ab Bhi Pukarta Hal and Muihe Bhi Chand Chahiye.
His one-man performance in Nirmal Verma 's "Dusri Duniya ", Vi/ay Dan

Dethe 's "Duvidha " and Arnold Wesker's " Whatever Happened to Betty
Lemon " is yet another feather to his cap.

DIRECTOR’3 NOTE
My Dear and Respected Audience,

Communism. . . Socialism. . . Fascism. . . this ism. . . and that ism. . . ! Too heavy
terms. . . ! More heavier is the meaning... Life is getting over loaded with
too much of sense... sensibilities and sensitivities...’ So let us go NONSENSE for some time. Let us give our mind some rest and let us try to
search a deep roaring Laughter which is getting lost slowly amongst us.
The Play is...

FOR THE FUN
OF THE FUN
AND
BY THE FUN.
Criticism is welcome.

With my actor's. . .
Your’s Piyush Mishra
