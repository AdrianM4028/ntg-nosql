RAM
Today marks the beginning of
the 38th year'of Ram Lila and .
whenever I think, write or speak
of it । am overwhelmed by
'
memories and nostalgia. I feel

proud of my association with the
Kendra and with the Ram Lila.
And yet, as । look back with fond
recollection, I feel that there is so
much to do and there is so little
ti me.
I remember the wonder of
witnessing traditional Ram Lilas
in Varanasi as a young college
student. And, as I had classic
Hindu education, the

Ramchar'ifmanas has given me
impressions I still live with today.
I n the Ramchar'itmanas all
aspects of dharma are explored.
Never a dry exposition of
philosophy, the epic teaches

dharma through the actions of
gods, demons and humans. The

characters possess unique
personalities as well as being
archetypes for ethical dilemmas.
This approach to life and duty is

a strong reason for my

fascination with the epic. l n the
Kendra’s Ram Lila, episodes
have always been chosen for
their spiritual as well as
emotional appeal, for it is
through these two avenues that
the teaching of dharma can be
successfully imparted.
When writing of the history of
the Kendra’s Ram Lila, I could fill

page after nostalgic page with
the names of the wonderful
artists, friends and family
members who have all in their
own way made it possible. But
perhaps my fondest memories
are of the earliest days, the

was only today the Late Smt.
Nirrnala Joshi, the First Secretary
of Sangeet Natak Akaderni,
whose memory I cherish, and
with whom I had an exchange of
thoughts about the production of
Ram Lila. To make a brief
mention of the dedicated team to
whom full credit must go, the
eminent Hindi poet Ramdhari
Singh ‘Dinkar’ chose relevant
portions of Goswami Tulsidas's
Ramchar/‘tmanas and collected
Maithili folk songs relevant to the
theme, Rahi writing the
necessary connecting lyrics.
Narendra Sharma when
requested, very willingly, not only
choreographed the dancedrarna but also took charge of all
aspects of organising the Ram
Lila, such as the selection of
artists, the induction of Sushil
Das GUpta for composing the
music and Bhagwandas Verrna
for designing the costumes, as

also to act as Ram. ‘ I
To Nirmalajit goes the credit of
inducting Jyotindra Moitra for
composition of music, and Tapas
Sen who, along with lnder
Razdan, were responsible for
lighting and stage design
respectively. With this dedicated
talented team to help place us
on a sound footing, the
foundation for the Ram Lila-was
laid. The basement of my
residence became the ideal
place for all the activities

_ associated with Ram Lila.
I can still very vividly recall the
first public performance on the
first day with the Prime Minister
present, we waited with bated
breath for the last curtain fall to

exhilaration of creating

discover to our delight the

something out of nothing, the

resounding success of the

daily contact with the artistes of
many disciplines — dancers,
musicians, writers, etc. In those
early days I felt a great sense of

dance—drama. My joy knew no
bounds, and since that day there
has been no looking back. Every
year the Kendra’s Ram Lila is
staged in Delhi and each year it

community which I cherish to
this day.
A beginning was 'made in 1957
with the production of Ram Lila.
Looking back, the memories are
vibrant and alive. I feel as if it

seems to be more spectacular
than before, with one lakh people

witnessing the show every year.
Today it is with a sense of
amazement and pleasure that I

look at Ram Lila now in its 38th
year. The performance evokes
the cumulative spirit of all those
who have in some way or
another contributed. And if there
is any other person in my family
who shares this depth of feeling
with me, it is my daughter,
Shobha, who has in many ways
grown with the Ram Lila. I
remember the day when Shobha,
a little child, accompanied me to
Ram Lila rehearsals. She
watched for several years with
great fascination the preparation
of the dance-drama, not realizing
that one day she will be called
upon to shoulder the
responsibility of overseeing the
same preparation. From her
childhood fascination for all the

backstage preparations to her
eventual maturing into the one
who continues to oversee the
production, her emotional link
with the Ram Lila is as strong as
mine.
.
A production such as the Ram
Lila is a team effort, and I shall
be ever grateful to all the

choreographers, composers,
designers and dancers, who
have sustained the dance-drama
through the year—once the firm
foundatidn was laid by the
original team of creative artistes.
Amongst many others, ।
remember with fondness and
gratitude, Guru Gopinath,
Devendra Shankar, Yog Sunder,
Krishnan Narnbudiri and K.
Shekhara n .
The Kendra’s Ram Lila has
survived with great aplornb for
four decades. And given the will,
the will to change, I have no
doubt that we shall continue to
be contemporary and relevant,
as a theatrical experience, as
long as the great epic Ramayana

' itself lives. It is in this spirit of
experimentation and adaptability

that after having staged the
shows for 37 years in sprawling

grounds of Ferozeshah Kotla, we
have moved the show this year
to our own premises in the lawns

of the Kendra. Though a
