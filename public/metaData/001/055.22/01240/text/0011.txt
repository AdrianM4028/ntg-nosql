RAM LILA—THE SHIFTING POINT
The shift in the venue of Ram
Lila from Ferozeshah Kotla
Grounds to the Kendra’s Lawns

this year has inspired a shift in
the conceptualization of this
theatrical event.

lt was important to decide
which stream of thought should
we follow. It was resolved to
design the stage setting without
touching the traditional format.
Simultaneously, we worked on
creating a parallel stream which
would stimulate a dialogue
between the spectator and the
performer.
A powerful music score along
with carefully worked—out spaces
of good and evil provided the
backbone for the production to
retain its ethereal flavour in order
for the spectator to be able to
commune with the divine.
With the change in site we
took the opportunity to expose
the layers of history which lie
between the past and the
present. In the process of doing
this we were faced with several
important questions. What is the
audience segment? What are we
trying to portray through the
costumes and stage-set with
regard to the period and its
context? As it is, the Kendra’s
Ram Lila has had a widespread
influence on all Ram Lilas of the
capital in aspects of design
approach. To go one step further
in our design process, this year
we decided to create an
environment which would enable
the spectator to perceive the
movements of the dancers on
the spatial structure. and thereby
comprehend the message of the
Ramayana as a way of life. The
scroll on the side of the stage is

the staging of the performances.
Every member of the Kendra’s
team has had a creative role to
play. Designers are dependent
on creative skill for the
interpretation of their design. For
this we are grateful to the
carpenters, tailors, stage-hands,
electricians, civil engineers,
sponsors and financiers who
interpreted ideas into visual form.

With the creation of the new
space the dancers adapted the
choreography to interpret the
essence of the concept. The
designers in all the departments
of production have come forth
and put in their best. Mr Tapas
Sen for lighting, Ms Sarika
environmental design concept,

and Mr B.K. sawant for set

process which will be set in

motion from the very first day of

members of my family— especiauy

intervals, of the relationship of
the myth to the present society.
This year’s production is an
introduction to the rnyriads of
possibilities in areas of design. In
years to come this will provide

an insight into that thought

strongly felt that the spectator
may, in the encapsulated
duration of the show, transcend
the barrier between him and

God. Then only when the show
is over, he should come home
with the satisfaction of having
witnessed and being a part of
that spectacle where the
conquest of good over evil
becomes a way of life for him.

Narain for stage and

design.
The audience of course is our
ultimate judge. Their response
year after year helps us in our
renewed interpretation. Last but
not least is the emotional support
which our social system
enforces upon women to
undertake this kind of an effort.
For this I am indebted to all

a poignant reminder at regular

mymother, Smt. Sumitra Charat
Ram and my husband, Shri
Deepak Singh who bore with me
throughout my periods of stress
during the production.
Everything visually seen in this
Ram Lila is the statement of a
thought process thisyear. It was
