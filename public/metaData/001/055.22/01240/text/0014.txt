SHRIRAM BHARATIYA KALA KENDRA
Shrirarn Bharatiya Kala
Kendra's beginning can be
traced to a small but exclusive
sponsoring body called
Jhankar' which was set up in
1947. The Kendra formally
came into existence in 1952
when it was registered as a
society under the Societies'
Registration Act, 1860. Since
then it has grown and
blossomed over the years as
one of the premier cultural
institutions of India.

Kathak now takes a rightful
place among the great dance
styles of India.

Ever since its inception, the
preservation of the country's
cultural heritage and the
promotion of performing arts
has been the active concern of

produced in the Chhau style.

the Kendra. It takes special
care in whatever it does to see
that its activities remained
linked with and have a direct
bearing on the problems and
requirements of contemporary

performing arts, and do not,
under any circumstances,
become obscurantist or
escapist.
The Kendra maintains a
permanent dance-drama
group. Through its various
programmes and stage
performances, the group has
tried to capture and enshrine
as aesthetically as possible the
best from our religion,
mythology and folklore. And,
the Ram Lila performed well
over thousand nights both in
India and abroad has been one
of its major achievements.
