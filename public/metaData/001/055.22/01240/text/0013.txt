Across the years! I, attended the

rehearsals of SBKK Rarnlila. This
evening, the songs, the music,
the choreography everything
literally took me back to the early
years of the performance — with
Narendra Sharma, Jyotindra
Moitra — Botukda as we fondly
called him — it was sort of a
flashback down memory lane
with my long and close
association of the Rarnlila event
since 1957! Names come before
my mind's eye: Guru Gopinath,
the unforgettable K. Shekharan
who so admirably directed the
show for years and acted as
Ravan—all the voices on the
music track of Subhash Dutta
and Shelley Dutta and many
)ther effects fill my ears—
3ounds orchestrated by Barun
3 upta!
Ram Lila in Ferozeshah Kotla
has become almost synoymous
vith Delhi’s cultural calendar.
Looking back to the hutrnent
days of Bharatiya Kala Kendra
when stalwarts like Naina Devi,
Devender Shankar and Birju
Maharaj all worked together as a
family—it is a long way. I
personally have been struggling
emotional feelings when l find in
the new environment of Ram
Lila, old g'uards like Sumitrajee
(Mrs Charat Ram, the inspiring
figure of the Kendra) and our old
artist friend, Jaydev still keeping

his continuity in the role of the
<ing Dashrath.
Many have gone, left us for
ever but tonight in this new
location of Ram’s Lila I express
my gratitude to all those who
have associated themselves with
'his national event. I cannot
orget colleagues in this
spectacle of singers, dancers,
"tusicians and technicians.
I may add here that this
change of location will provide
challenge to young creative
persons like Shobha Deepak

Singh, Sarika and Badal and all
their younger associates. An old
hand like me will try to form and

innovate the theme of Ram Lila
with the many open avenues of
improvisation to add further a
dimension—why not?

PRODUCTION N OT E
Performed annually to coincide
with the festival of Dussehra for
the past 37 years with a large
cast of 45 artists and
technicians, Flam Lila is perhaps
the most enduring of Indian
theatrical performances. it has
had a popular run of over 1500
nights and has been seen by
lakhs of people throughout the
country and in several other
parts of the world—a record not
surpassed in the recent history
of Indian dance theatre—is also
an index of the larger public

approbation of its artistic appeal.
The Kendra can be proud of its
achievement in having created
and sustained a popular show
based on one of our most
treasured works of national
heritage—the Ramayana.
Both the dance and the music
of the Ram Lila are conscious
arnalgarns of related yet

distinctly different styles, using
techniques of the classical
canons of both the North and the
South as well as folk and
ritualistic elements. The
costumes and ornaments have
been produced in a consciously
eclectic manner; elaborate
crowns reminiscent of pan—
Indian art, folk costumes from
the northern regions and the
traditional regalia of the South.
The lighting scheme designed by
Tapas Sen adds to the unfolding
of dramatic action.
A line of gifted performers has
always sustained the Ram Lila
with interpretations of major
roles by such dancers as Urna
Sharma, Raghavan Nair,
Bhushan Lakhandri, Vaswati

Mishra, Harish Rawat, Ravi

Chauhan, Savitri Chhetri, Sunita
Pandey, Padam Gurung and
३
Prashant Bose.
' ln interpreting the Ramayana,
the Kendra has concentrated on
the universality of the theme. In
each domain from the textual to
the aural to the visual, the epic’s
import has been emphasized
through a diversity of dramatic
techniques. Thus, it can be
appreciated at many levels
including interpreting narration of

a well-loved story, dramatic
dance delineation of the epic’s
emotional and devotional
landscapes, and the recreating
of the visual splendour of a
distant yet still palpably relevant
time.
