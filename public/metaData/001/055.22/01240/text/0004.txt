I am glad to know that, as in
. previous years, Bharatiya Kala
Kendra, as part of celebrations
of Dussehra festival, will be
presenting its popular ballet of
Flam Char/t Manas. This ballet
has come to occupy a prominent
place on the cultural scene of
the capital on account of its
artistic excellence and the moral
message of the great epic. No
wonder the people of Delhi
eagerly look forward to this
colourful and meaningful cultural
event.

"

/ convey my good wishes for
the success of this ballet
performance.

—K.R. NARAYANAN
