I send my good wishes and
congratulations to the Shriram
Bharatiya Kala Kendra for its
Ballet on the Ram Char/t Manas
beginning the 5th of October,
1994. The Kala Kendra has
enriched the cultural life of Delhi
over the last many years, and its

ballet on the life of Lord Rama
during Dussehra is an event that
has evoked great appreciation.
