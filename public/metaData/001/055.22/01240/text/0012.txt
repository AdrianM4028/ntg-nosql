RAM LlLA—THEATRE OF THE CITY
‘THE DISCOVERY OF THE
LOST MVTH’
The ‘performance’ of the Ram
Lila has become an integral part
of our Indian culture: The act of
going to watch the Ram Lila has
become a ritual in itself. It is like
a cleansing ritual. Today, there is

a concern about fragmentation
alienation of Man at all levels:
individual, societal, physical.
psychical and cosmic. One way
to discover this totality is to
discover the concept of the
'Ramayana, the great epic. It is a
record of Valmiki’s observation

of the worth .of human life. '
Ecstacies of conjugal love, joys
of parental affection, traditional
devotion and the thrill of virtuous
enterprise, jealousies and

uncalled—for hostilities were
observed in the light of their
limitations in the circumstances,
and man was often a helpless

victim to his impulse.
Through this ritual
performance, we, at the Kendra,
take the opportunity to expose,
that the narrative of the

Ramayana is a reflection of the
society. Instead of just enjoying
the performers performing their
roles we must make an attempt
to perceive the subtleties in the
situations that arose along
Ram’s life and appreciate that he
took life as a duty and
surrendered to a high deal only.
Through this performance, an
attempt has been made to
expose this phenomenon of
mirroring, of the two societies
which is emphasized by the
exploration of this performance
tonight, through two sets of
states—the traditional and the
contemporary. The two are
separated by a scroll and a
reflective plane .on either side of
the stage, both syrnbolising the
frozen time. I n this way we justify
the role of theatre as a vehicle
for transformatibn.
Public life in a city is like a
‘theatre of the city”. All city
people become actors of a kind,
playing out their public roles.

During festivities anonymity is
preserved by wearing costumes
and jewellery.
It is by exposing such
theatrics, we expose the theatre
of the city. The stage set is a
reflection of life. Life is
ephemeral. However, in time the

ceremony becomes just a quaint
a nac h ron is m .
The performance attempts to
expose the relation with the
modern world and to instill an

awareness of the predicament of
life today. The theatre of the city,
by requiring the spectators to
become a part of the ‘play’ or a
participant, enables them to
equate an understanding of the
fate of life, to theatre.
The performance is about
human relationships in everyday
life. The path to the theatre —the
experience of each site is the
length of the performance. The
backdrops are set by the existing

buildings: The sacred, profane
exist simultaneously. The
experimental theatrical world
exists with the transformation of
a line into a plane into a' space.
Reflections and shadows
superimpose, as characters and
the spectators interact. All
participants become spectators
and performers. We become
participants of a play in progress.
The journey in the direction of
the exit reveals the backdrop
which introduces us to the
private and the sacred final act,
of the discovery of the inner
recesses of self.
Thus through this experiment,
we manifest that the experience
of the performance transforms a
mundane space to a
consecrated space in fixed time
and duration. In this way the
ritual space mediates between
the Man’s psyche, Nature of the
universe and the Divine. The
expression of the consecrated
space is meant to lead Man to
experience the wholeness and
totality of what we would call
sacred space. This experience
can be individual, as inner silent

participation or collective.

Through this process we can
enrich our inner lives of
reflection, in relation to our outer
space of action.
