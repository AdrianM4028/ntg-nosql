of experimentation । feel will
enrich the production and
sustain growth in the years to

come.
। owe a great deal to my elders
in the family who gave me all the
encouragement in the very
beginning. । also owe a great
deal to my brother, Shri Dharrna
Vira, now the Chairman of the
Kendra, for his continued
guidance and support.
Expression of my gratitude
and deep appreciation would not
be complete if I did not make a
mention of INALSA Limited, who '
have, all along, and over the
year, given their unstinted and
valuable support in the day—today administrative and technical
requirements of the Kendra.
Shriram Industrial Enterprises
Limited on the other hand, has
willingly responded to all our
demands, irrespective of the
magnitude and urgency, more
often, even before the desire for
any form of assistance could be
expressed. But for their timely
help, we may not have been able
to stage the Ram Lila on our
lawns this year.
Last but not least, I thank my
husband Dr Charat Ram, without
whose support and
encouragement nothing would
have been possible. in his quite
unobtrusive way, he has been
my mentor and guide.
As I look ahead । am filled with

hope for the future. There is so much to be done and
possibilities are many, I am
confident that the young team
' which is now in the process of taking over from me will see the

Kendra grow and develop along
the vision that inspired me during
all these years.
