BHARATIYA KALA KENDRA
’I‘HE Bharatiya Kala Kendra is a product of post-independence cultural renaissance in India. Starting
modestly in 1952 as an organizer of music festivals, and other similar shows—with an eye on I enter-

tainment—it has since then developed into an institution for the development and promotion and fperpetuation of classical artistic forms.
The Kendra seeks to strive for redeeming art from neglect and decadence, and for adapting it to

present-day requirements. On the one hand traditional values had to be preserved, and on the other, art
had to be infused with a new spirit and ﬂair. Thus alone could it be made a vehicle of modern creative
though t and expression.

COLLEGE
In the ﬁeld of perpetuation of art, the Kendra seeks to provide nascent talent with opportunity for
learning from the masters themselves in an atmosphere of academic discipline. lts College of Music and

Dance, established in 1955, has had the active patronage of such eminent artists as Shri Shambhu Maharaj,
Dagar Brothers, Ustad Haﬁz Ali Khan, Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan, Shri Sunder Prasad, Ustad Wahid
Khan and Shri Birju Maharaj.

The Kendra also runs preparatory classes in vocal music and dance to screen young talent for the
beneﬁt of higher learning. Kumari Maya Rao is incharge of the Dance section. Raj Kumar Rani Neena

Ripjit Singh, an accomplished artist, is the

Directress of the College.
