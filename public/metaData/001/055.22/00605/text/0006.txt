REVIVAL OF KA'I‘HAK
The Kendra takes pride in its revival of the Kathak dance and for bringing out its immense potentialities as a vehicle for presentation of classical plays in the form of dance dramas. Skilled foot-work
and the beauty of mime and gesture, combined with ingeniously adapted music, have made the Kendra’s experiment eminently successful. This has been aided by special attention given to the style of presentation,
authenticity and grandeur of costumes and accomplished choreography. Kathak dance patterns evolved by
the Kendra’s dancers have, by their originality and charm, won many new admirers, and have helped in
restoring this form of dancing to a well-deserved pedestal of honour.

DANCE DRAMAS
For propagation of art forms, the Kendra has created several stage shows based on classical and folk
styles.

RAMLILA was the ﬁrst and the most spectacular production of the folk variety. It has been
staged annually for the last four years and has won the interest of the critic and the spectator equally for its
vitality and trueness to classical values. MALATI MADHAV, KUMAR SAMBHAV AND SHAN-E-OUDH
are three dance dramas based on the Kathak dance technique. These have been universally admired for the

originality of adaptation of this style of dancing to requirements of modern stage. The music of the plays is
of particular interest, with its classical colouring both in vocal and orchestra] aspects, and for the reﬂection
of shifting moods and situation of the plays.

PUPPE'I‘RY
Another form in which the Kendra has s'triven to reCeive traditional arts, is Puppetry. Is has produced
several successful puppet plays like PRITHVIRAJ SNYOGTA, DHOLA MARU, JHANSI KI RANI & KRISHAN SUDAMA, and continues to experiment with new forms of this technique.
