'I‘HE Bharatiya Kala Kendra has made a bold attempt to portray Gurudev Rabindranath’s ‘Dalia’ through

the medium of Kathak. It hopes to disprove the opinion of some that Tagore's themes cannot be expressed through this medium. Such is the richness and variety of Gurudev’s works that they are susceptible of expression through any medium of art. The general notion that the Kathak dance-form is expressed
through foot-work alone is not correct. Its ‘Natya’ element offers great scope for spontaneity of expression.
It is» an earnest endeavour of this Institution to do justice to Gurudev’s work and thus pay its humble tribute
to his greatness.
Shri Brijmohan Maharaj has moulded this short story into a dance-drama and has provided the
choreography. Shri Satish Bhatia has composed the music, while Shri Jyotirindra Moitra has personally
supervised the rendering of Rabindra Sangeet and its allied eiTects to maintain the spirit of Tagore’s theme.
The decor and costumes have been devised by Shri Nizam Babban. Shri Sitangshu Mukherjee has been
responsible for the lighting. Every effort has been made to conform to the costumes and decor of the period
and place depicted and folk dances and tunes with touches of Burmese music have been introduced where
necessary to suit a particular situation.
Dalia was staged by the Calcutta Amateur Players in 1933 under the guidance of the Poet himself.
The songs chosen by him on that occasion have been included in this production and the changes suggested
by him in the ﬁnal scene have also been incorporated.

The Kendra is grateful to Shri Modhu Bose for letting it use the script and details of the original
production thereby enabling it to adhere in this production the Poet’s conception of it.
