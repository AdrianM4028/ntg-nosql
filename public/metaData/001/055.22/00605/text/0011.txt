DA LI A
SCENE I A forest on the Indian and Arakanese border : Vanquished Shah Shuja ﬂees from the wrath of
his brother Aurangzeb, with his 3 daughters, Fatima, Zulekha and Amina, the last a mere child.

He is accompanied by his trusted lieutenant Rehmat Sheikh.
SCENE II The palace, Arakan : Whilst enjoying a dance performance, the King of Arakan is informed of

Shah Shuja’s arrival. The King welcomes Shah Shuja and his daughters and assures them safety
in his territory. Struck by the beauty of Fatima and Zulekha the King proposes marriage between
them and two members of the Arakan royal family. Shah Shuja, a descendant of the Great
Moghuls ﬁnds it impossible to cherish such a proposal and declines with regret the King’s gracious
offer. Enraged by his refusal the King decides to avenge himself of this insult.
SCENE III A royal barge : Wholly ignorant of a nefarious plot, Shah Shuja, his 3 daughters, and Rehmat
Sheikh go on a river excursion. Whilst relaxing on the royal barge listening to a lilting even tide

song of the boatman on a moonlit night, they are suddenly attacked by the Arakan King’s men,

disguised as pirates. Shuja ﬁghts bravely against the desperate odds, but is ﬁnally killed after
throwing his baby daughter into the river to save her from the cruel hands of the pirates. Fatima,
the eldest daughter ﬁnding no way of the escape commits suicide. Rehmat Sheikh helplessly watches
the last struggle of his master and on his command helps Zulekha to escape. They both
take a solemn vow to vindicate the death of Shah Shuja.
