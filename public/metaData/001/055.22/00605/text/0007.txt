GENERAL
Bharatiya

Kala Kendra’s contribution to the revival and adaptation of classical art forms, is

modest, but it takes pride in the originality of its approach and improvement of neglected forms of Art and
bringing them to the layman and the connoisseur alike. The success of its experiments is its pledge for
undertaking new ones.
The Kendra has been allotted—a plot of land by the Government of India where it is undertaking the
construction of its own premises. This will go a long way to enable it to concentrate on its work.
Like any other institution devoted to art, the Kendra’s ﬁnances are chronically. short of its needs. It
has full hope that members of the Kendra as well as others interested in our country’s cultural renaissance
will give their support to the Kendra to enable it to build up a corpus which will lend ﬁnancial stability to its
experiment in Art and culture.
