ES OF INDIA”
RADIO 8८ DRAMA CRITIC, “TIM
A POPULAR notion about critics is,
I suppose, of a flock of vultures, eager to
pOunce upon a meaty morsel the moment
it is exposed to the eye. Most playwrights
producers and actors, with whom the dramatic critic has to deal in the course of his
professional work, regard him as a sort of
cross between a viper and a pain in the neck.
This attitude is not peculiar to artistes
in India; it is universal. Nor is it a new phenomenon; it has existed for centuries. Dr.

Samuel Johnson, for instance, remarked over
200 years ago: “Criticism is a study by which
men grow important at a very small expense.
He whom nature has made weak and idleness
keeps ignorant, may yet support his vanity
by the name of a critic."

at one or at the other, and have failed; therefore they turn critics.”
Such remarks by artistes about critics
can be multiplied; they show that a sort of
tension has nearly always prevailed between
the two. It certainly prevails today. But,
thanks perhaps to modern civilisation, it is
not as violent nor as passionate as it could
occasionaly be in the past, when an author
would challenge a critic to a duel, or vice
versa. Over a hundred years ago, John Scott,
Editor of the London Magazine, was actually
killed in a duel which followed his attacks
on John Lockhart, the Scottish writer, for
certain critical reviews.

Even works of great masters have
been variously received. James Joyce, for
example, was described by one critic as a
very much over-rated writer and by another
as the greatest artist of his generation. George
Bernard Shaw, one of the greatest dramatists
of the age, came across positively hostile
critics when he first ventured into the
theatre.
This should not surprise. In art, as the
poet Sturge Moore said, there are no principles. There can be only personal appre—
ciation. Why one man loathes Milton and
