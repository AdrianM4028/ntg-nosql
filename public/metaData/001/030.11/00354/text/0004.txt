At the request of U. P. and Bihar state
Govts, Natya Niketan ventured a tour of the two states with their new production

‘NAV PRABf-IAT'.

The play which was

directed by Shri B. Narain was well received
by the audience throughout the tour. In
the next month repeated performances

were given in the state of Madhya Pradesh.
Natya Niketan staged ‘Gaon Ki Ore' in
the Second Summer Drama Festival of the
Song and Drama Division held this year in
May. Its artists also helped and worked in
the Division’s two productions Naya Rasta
and Charudutta. All these plays proved
very successful with the audience.
Natya Niketan has not only confined
its activities to the production of plays
but have also made its contribution for i

the people".
Natya Niketan has fully grasped the
lesson, and made it the mission of its life. It
is conscious of the fact that the stage coul
be a medium of high purpose; it could not
only entertain people but also educate and ' the development of national theatre moveinstruct them. It could be particularly effec~
