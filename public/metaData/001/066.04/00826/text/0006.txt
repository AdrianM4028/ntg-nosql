Hindi translation from a famous American
romantic comedy Richard Nash’s“The Rain
Maker"which deals with hope, trust, love and
miracles.
In this play one will find the same problem
which an Indian father faces to get his daughter

married. Adjudged as the best Calcutta
production of 1990 by the West Bengal Govt.
Rodney Marriott, the American director made
the production memorable. Unfortunately he
died in Calcutta just after its first show. Number
of shows of Baarishwala has crossed 89.

It is a rare experience to witness such powerful
and coordinated acting.
Desh, 16.2.91
The efficient team work of the artists which
characterised Padatik's earlier productions, were
more clearly in evidence in ’Baarishwala'.
Anand Bazar Patrika, 12.10.90

Christopher Barrecca's beautiful design offers
interested viewers lessons in neo-naturalistic
stagecraft....ln his zealous commitment to
produce a play that could be placed at par

with any Broadway production, Marriott had
excelled himself.
