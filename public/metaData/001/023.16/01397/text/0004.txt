The art of Lithography
Lithography is the art of printing from stone. The technique is based _on the
property of the ability of water to resist grease. The image is deﬁned by drawing
on the printing surface with a tusche (greasy ink) or crayon that attracts lithographic ink.
The surface is then covered with water, which adheres to all areas
not treated with the tusche, and repels the lithOgraphic ink, The inked stone is
then printed on paper in a special press.
The process was discovered in 1796 by Aloys Senefelder. It was not until the 18205
that the method aroused the interest of artists. Their use of it in France was
encouraged by Gottﬁeld Engelmann, a printer from Senefelder’s workshop, who
set up a press in Paris. Theodore Gericault and Eugéne Delacroix were among
the first practitioners. Honore Daumier, the most proliﬁc among them, was
one of the first lithographers to make use of the process called transfer
lithography, by which the tusche drawing is

made

on

paper

instead

of

the

lithographic stone,
The drawing is ﬁxed to the stone and printed the
usual way.
Colour lithographs called chromo lithographs 0r oleographs were developed in the
latter half of the 19th century. Although popular, they depicted poor quality. In
the hands of 'I‘oulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), however, colour lithography attained
new heights, and his example was enthusiastically followed by Paul Gaugin,
Pierre Bonnard and Edouard Vuillard.
Lithography is one of the most faithful means of reproduction, printing directly
from the touch of the artist. With no wear in printing almost unlimited copies
can be made from a single stone.

Lithography was

used effectively to achieve

extremely powerful images by 20th century artists such as the Norwegian Edward
Munch ; the German Kathe Kollwitz ; and Jose Clemente Orozco, Diego
Rivers
and Ruﬂno Jamayo of Mexico.
“Lithographic II” is an exhibition of 50 original lithographs by contemporary Artists.
A list of the artists and their paintings on display at Alliance Francaise de Delhi
will
be given to the visitors.
