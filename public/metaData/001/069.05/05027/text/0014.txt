(Roget. Under श्या Reputation Act... 1860. WQNoA of I938)

Purnea has always been in various national maps since ages or since the inception of districts in the country.
Agriculture. education, sports, literature, music, theater are few areas that made Purnea great.
Theater here is probably eight decades old. When there would be no lights, gas lights were being used to
stage shows. Even during our days, some 25-30 yrs. back, stage, light, sound, everything was a problem, we
took hardship a routine and played and played.
Today when with the grace of almighty, quite a number of public and private with moderate infrastructure
is available, the urge amongst the youth for theater is lost. May be the western inﬂuence in our day to day life
and education is changing our cultural instincts.
However when there is a crisis ,there is a vacuum, BHANAK took the risk to prove it for once again that
Purnea is a land of theater and theater shall always live in Purnea. In last few years BHANAK has produced
several plays and have hosted quite a number of festivals, small or medium.

But this time, no wonder, the month long workshop followed by this festival which is conjunctive of two
major events, is definitely going to create a history. The "Natyotsav" is very new and a great event for Purnea
people.

Thakoor's "Rakto karobi“, the present production of BHANAK in question, is a slap on the then
sociopolitical system. Mr. Mithlesh Roy( a NSD graduate), virtually my friend too, has dared to direct the play
with Mr. Jaideep Mukherjee on music, shall deﬁnitely give us joy and immense pleasure. We salute the event
and the efforts.
A question often people ask me these days,"how Bengalee Tagore is“. I believe Thakoor belongs to every

We promise to extent every possible support and request each citizen of Purnea to cooperate.
