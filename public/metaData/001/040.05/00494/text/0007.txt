All this watch closely. Then in your mind’s eye
From all the struggles waged

The struggle for work,
Bitter and sweet dialogues between men and women,

Talk about books,
Resignation and rebellion,
Trials and failures,

All these you must later show as
Historical processes.
(Even of us here and now

You might make such a picture:
The playwright, having ﬂed his country,
Instructs you in the art of observation.)
To observe

You must learn to compare.
To be able to compare
You must have observed already.
From observation comes knowledge.

He who does not know
What to make of his observation
Will observe badly.

The fruit grower will look at the apple tree
With a keener eye than the strolling walker.

But only he who knows that the fate of man is man
Can see his fellow men keenly with accuracy.
The art of observing men

Is only part of the skill of leading them.
And your job as actors
Should make you prospectors and teachers
Of this larger skill.
By knowing and demonstrating the nature of men

You will teach others to lead their own lives.
You will teach them the great art of living together.

How can we—

Kept down, kept moving, kept ignorant
Kept in uncertainty
