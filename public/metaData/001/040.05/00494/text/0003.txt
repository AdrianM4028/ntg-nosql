An Address to Danish Worker Actors on the Art of
Observation
by Berto It Brecht

You have come here to act plays .
But now you are to be asked :
For what purpose ?

You have come here to reveal

Yourselves in all that you can do.

You think this worthy of being watched.
And you hope the people will applaud
As you transport them
Out of the narrowness of their world

into the largeness of yours,
Sharing with you the dizzy peaks
And the tumults of passion.
But now you are to be asked :
For what purpose is this ?
On their low benches
Your spectators begin to argue.
Some hold and maintain
You must do more than show yourselves.
You mu:t show the world.
Where is the use, they ask,
Of being shown time again
How this one can be sad
How she is heartless
How that one would make a wicked king ?
Where is the use in this endless
Exhibiting of grimaces,
These antics of a handful
In the hands of their fate ?

You show us only people dragged along,
Victims of foreign forces and themselves.
An invisible master
Throws them down
Their joys like crumbs to dogs.
And so too the noose is ﬁtted round their
The tribulation that comes from above.
And we on our low benches
Held by your twitches and grimacing fac

We gape with ﬁxed eyes
