Being led by the hand

Out from the world given them,
Out from the one they cannot master.
Whom then, actors, should you obey ?
Iâ€™d say : the discontened.
Yet how to begin ? How to show

The living together of men
That it may be understood
And become a world that can be mastered ?
How to reveal not only yourselves and others
Floundering in the net
But also make clear how the net of fate
ls knotted and cast,
Cast and knotted by men ?
Above all other arts
You, the actor, must conquer
The art of observation.
Of no account at all
How you look.
But what you have seen
And what you reveal does count.
It is worth knowing what you know.
They will watch you
To see how well you have watched,
But one who observes only himself
Gains no knowledge of men.
From himself he hides too much of himself.
And no man is wiser than he has become.

Therefore your training must begin among
The lives of other people.

Make your first School

The place you work in, your home,
The district to which you belong,
The shop. the street, the train.
Observe each one you set eyes upon.
Observe strangers as if they were familiar
And those whom you know as if they were strangers.
