Look. A man pays out his taxes.
Other men paying their taxes.
Even though it is true

He diﬁ'ers from

No man pays thern gladly.
In these circumstances
He may even dilTer from his normal self.
And is the man who collects the taxes diﬁerent
In every way from the man who must pay 7
The collector must also contribute his due

And he has much else in common
With the one he oppresses.
Listen.
This woman has not always spoken with her present harshness ;

She does not speak so harshly to all.
Nor does that charmer charm every one.

Is the bullying customer
Tyrant all through ?

Is he not also full of fear ?
The mother without shoes for her children
Looks defeated,
But with the courage still left her
Whole empires were conquered :
She is bearing—you saw ?— another child.
And have you seen
The eyes of a sick man told

He can never be well again
Yet could be well
Were he not compelled to work ?
Observe how he spends such time as remains

Turning the pages of a book telling
How to make the earth a habitable planet.
Remember too the press photos and the newsreels.
Study your rulers

Walking and talking and holding in their pale
Cruel hands

The threads of your fate.
Make pictures

Unfolding and growing like movements in history.
For later that is how you must show them on the stage.
