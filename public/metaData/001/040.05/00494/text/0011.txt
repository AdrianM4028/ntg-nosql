Why we Study Brecht

[1le statement ‘Brecht is one of the greatest playwrights of the

20th century whose inﬂuence has spread and injected theatre
throughout the world’ must be justiﬁed. Of what importance
is Brecht to us in India to-day? In order to understand Brecht,
one has to understand his conception of the world, namely, as
a place which must be made worthwhile to live in—a place

where the dignity and amazing productive capacity of the
human being must be given scope to express itself in the most
creative manner possible.
Brecht, whose major works were written during the capitalist
phase of the now socialist German Democratic Republic, saw

this society of classes as being incapable of fulﬁlling its most
important task, namely, of allowing the human being to think

and act as freely and creatively as possible. Brecht understood
the world ‘freedom’ in its true sense i.e. the freedom of the
individual to act ethically, morally and creatively, without his
action having a detrimental effect on his fellow-men. In this
case the individual has to be aware of himself as only a single
individual in a society, and his responsibilities and needs are

therefore conditioned by the needs of his f'ellowrnen.
Brecht saw man as the creator of his environment, of being

capable of changing himself and the world. He saw the crying
need for change and his optimism in the capacity of the human
being to bring this about gives stature and depth to his plays.
Brecht looks at situations with humour and irony. His
characters are often failures who sometimes give up the task

before them, but this does not destroy Brecht’s faith in them.
In India and the world in general what greater themes could suit
the problems before us, problems whose cause we must discover
and whose solutions we must ﬁnd. In India we are still on the
threshold of developing a new theatre, a theatre that must

engage itself and reﬂect more accurately the historical events
that take place.
