The Company is based in
New Delhi, where it gives
regular performances. It has
a Studio Theatre and a
beautiful Open-Air Theatre.
The latter is one of the best of
its kind, situated in natural
surroundings readily
adaptable to different
environments and thus
enriching a different style of

productions which have been
staged here.
One of the remarkable
contributions of the
Company's activities which
has given a new dimension
and opened a new avenue for
the Indian theatre is the use
of historical monuments and

Quila Delhi for its landmark

productions like Andha Y'ug,
Tughlaq, Sultan Razia, etc.
Apart from performing in
Delhi the Company
undertakes extensive tours of
different parts of India every
year. It has also made a
successful tour to GDR, Poland

and participated in the
'Festival of India' in Britain
with Iasman Odan and

Tughlaq in 1982. In 1986 the
Company participated in
'Berlin Theatre Festival'

with Andha Yug.
This year N.S.D. Repertory

company completes
25 years in theatre.
