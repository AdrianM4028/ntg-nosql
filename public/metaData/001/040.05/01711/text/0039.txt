It is mainly throUgh English
that Volker Braun's Great
Peace has been translated into
Hindi. With the help of
Embassy of GDR in India we
were provided with this
translation for our wo rk i ng for
which we are grateful.
Earlier in August and then
again in November last year
Prof. Bennewitz discussed and
explained the German intents
to me word to word - I must
acknowledge.

Effort has been to blend the
words of classical origins and
that of contemporary rural

idioms. Prof. Bennwitz at
places wanted sounds of
English words as prevalent
today in India and so have
been used to contemporise the
texture.

The structure of dialogues
have been framed to suit the
style of acting as far possible.
During rehearsals fellow
artists have also contributed
to the process of evolution for
which I am specially
grateful.
