In the time of bloody
disorders the peasant Gau Dsuagainst his will - becomes a
hero. The location is Asiabefore Christian chronology.
The peasants butcher the
aritstocracy and proclaim the
Great Peace as it has been
propagated in the ancient
texts. The peace only meant:
no war; the Great Peace meant
equality. But the landâ€”
without power and rulesdecays (goes to the dogs), the
millet dries up, the canals are
mud and mire. The commanderin-chief and poet Tschu Jun
makes Gau Dsu emperor (who

resists by his rustic instincts)
and restores/ the steps/ in the

country of Tschin: the
agricultural terraces and the
terraces of power. The
philosopher Wang - in a
painful course of learning
which took his life twicewent to the bottom of the
matter, i .e. the epoch: a
revolution only can keep to its
cause if it changes the
conditions from the very basis
(thoroughly). The basis is
but the LABOUR, which -

still divided - again produces

the structure(s) of oppression.
At the end of the paly no end
of the struggles.
