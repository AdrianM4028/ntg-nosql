STAG E TWO
The team was divided into 3 groups. Booklets and the literature
were distributed. The groups read and discussed.

I don 't know how far we can go in showing the audience more
than what they already see, for what is needed is more of
education than a dramatic experience, which means our drama
has to be informative and educative.

I quite agree. But there is also a lot to say about people’s
attitude to it for there is a lot of ignorance about the disease. I,

I remember । saw a man with a patch. But 1 never felt scared.

And they tried to hide it.

resistance.

Renuka

If I do get the disease, I won’t let my family throw me out.
If I leave, it will be as a matter of principle and not
submission.

If । see a patient now, I would immediately ask: do you
treatment.

Earlier I used to think they are crooks who create wound
