ALARIPPU is a voluntary organisation working in different spheres of
rural and urban development, particularly in the field of training and
communications.

ALARIPPU is at present engaged
in a community theatre training project for field-level workers from a
number of voluntary agencies. Future
projects include: starting a newsletter
for networking development workers
and organisations interested in using
theatre in their work, organising
income-generating activities for women, and participatory evaluation of
specific organisations as requested by
them.
KATH Kl GADI is a National
School of Drama Repertory Company
production, which forms a key compo-

nent of a larger ALARIPPU project
sponsored by UNICEF. The project
relates to exploring attitudes towards
leprosy; increasing awareness about
the cause, treatment, and cure of the
disease; attempting to change negative
attitudes of the public towards those
suffering from leprosyâ€”all this through

the medium of theatre. Kath ki Gadi
was preceded and will be followed by
street theatre workshops in areas
where leprosy is endemic.
