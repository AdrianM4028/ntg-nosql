which are declairned in a stylized manner. Other sections are in
verse which are sung slowly and in a low key so as to evoke a
sense of serenity and elegance. The chorus share with the actor

the burden of revealing the dramatic text. The sharp high-pitched
notes of the flute mark the end of scenes or sequences. Whereas
the more melodious ﬂute pieces help to evoke supressed emotions.
The drums add to the tempo and emotional quality of the play.
By convention the Noh theatre utilizes a bare stage, minimal
properties and only two or three characters. The stylized use of

the body, speech and music seek to project the spiritual aspects of
Noh, which as in all Japanese arts, has its basis

the

Zen

philosophy.
There are ﬁve catagories of Noh plays “SOTOBA
KOMACHI” is a “mad woman” play and belongs to the fourth

group. The heroine of the play is Ono-no-Komachi once a distinguished court lady who was in the service of the Emperors
Nimmoyo (833-850) and Montoku (850-858).

She was greatly

admired for her beauty and her poetic gifts. In the play Kornachi
is shown in extreme old age, reduced to the level of a poor beggar
woman and suffering from occassional acts of madness.
Some monks of Koya, on their way to Miyako, meet the
old woman who is resting on a stupa. This becomes the occassion
for a controversy a Buddhist doctrine. Eventually they are
impressed by Kornachi’s wisdom.

Then she is seized by one of her ﬁts of madness being
possessed by the spirit of her dead lover. Through her suffering
she atones for the pain she had inﬂicted on him and continues to
seeking for salvation.
