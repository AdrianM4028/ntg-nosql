WRITER'S NOTE

About communication over

with the elements of nature,
while in the other, the dark

emphasis can be laid an the
diference betwen the East and

West. At one level it may be
more meaningful to speak of
North and South rather than
East and West. Put differently,

the North and South poles and
the band in-between. The
ancient cultures of the East and

West, in this special sense, are
Southern. They have been born
in this middle belt where the

rotation of the seasons is very
specifically seen. In the

reassurance to life. It is the
Indian tradition where 'winter'
and 'Spring' have not been seen
as opposed to each ether. They
have been coupled together and
refered to a twin concept. It is
here that the falling of the old
leaf is seen together with the
sprouting of the new bud. The
English poet has said, "The
hounds of spring in winter's

essential though meaningful

traces....." almost as if the
hunting hounds of spring are
following winter's footsteps. Or
that, "If winter comes can spring
be far behind ?" It is certainly
not for behind, spring is
following winter and different.
But the Indian sense of time has
not seen them separately. In the
Indian tradition-and in the

differences-in one, the existence
