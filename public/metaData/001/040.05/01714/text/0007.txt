Even the Muslims and the Parsis

began to desert (the company)
The Muslims outside raised a
‘hue and cry’ that the ‘new
Alfred‘ is turning into a ‘Hindu
Company’ like ‘Survijay’. In
such circumstances - at the

request of the owners of the
company —- af'ter Parivartan — I
wrote and staged an Urdu
Muslim Drama ‘Mashra-quihoor’. The company’s owners
were surprised to know that 1
could write Urdu as well . . .
In the success of ‘Mashra-quihoor’ ‘Fida Husain’s’ work was

appreciated by one and all. As
Raushanara~the number of
‘once-mores’ of songs (ghazals)
he took—was far more than the
ones enjoyed by ‘Nisar’ in
‘Veer Abhimanyu”.

After entering the 65th year of
life, I came to know and believe
that old age has begun. Disorders—typical of old age cropped

up. Maybe I would have worked
more but when the love-mon-

gering friends bid goodbye— ‘loneliness’—in the form of
emptiness—engulfed me, trans-

formed me into a ‘blank paper’.
