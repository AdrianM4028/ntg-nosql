strict disciplinarians because
they well knew that without
discipline it would be not just

difficult but impossible to work
with such a huge team. Fida
Husain told that the owners of
the companies had strong
principles. Once a rule is made
it must be followed. Fida
Husain ﬁrst started working in
Alfred Company. It was a big
company. Had its own rules.
Very strict. No body could have
beatle-leaf. Smoking was not
banned, but nobody could smoke

in the dressing room, nor
during the rehearsals. A ten
minutes ‘interval’ was given so
that the people could go out
and have a smoke. And the
manner of sitting in the
rehearsal was that for two, two
and a half hours—you just sit
and watch. The training being
imparted on stage or in the
room-you’ve got to see it.
Nobody could talk about with
each other, nor look around.
Nor sit cross-legged either. One
had to sit properly.
