the play represents a very important
truth of life.

हो गई है आज मुझ पर भी वही सादिक
मिसाल ।
MASHRI-QUI-HOOR was written
in mid-thirties of the twentieth

हर कमालेरा ज़चालौ हर ज-बाले-रा कमाला।
True, the old is gold but then

century— a period when the people

there is no ‘truth’ greater than the I
were much less pretentious. Life
was much more carefree. And this
was reﬂected in the various art
forms.
'
The Parsi theatre naturally came

to be an expression of people’s
beliefs, and morals of the times.
Presentation was over decorative,

overt, and thematically melodramatic and moralistic. Even the
audience-actor-relationship was
much more open. In the playhouses

audiences ‘roared’ for ‘once-rnores’
for the scenes or songs that
enraptured them. Whereas in the

streets they roared against the
injustice meted out to them by the
English.
Today, the life patterns have
changed drastically. Therefore, in
the art forms the. expressions too
have changed. And to present a
Parsi play with its beliefs and ideals
in the present, postgindependence

conditions would be a bit difﬁcult
and unconvincing. .Our attempt in

this productiOn, therefore, is by
itself a synthesis of the old and the

new, the traditional and the modern
I mean, speaking technically and
form-wise. Thematically I think
apart from all the frills and ideals,

the following lines by Sultan in

‘present’. Hence, respect the old
and hail the new!
