THE DIRECTOR'S NOTE
The Director's note is the
most potent weapon to destroy
a play. It attracts attention to
the director's personal prejudices. Rather than add an edge
to the production of the play
(this is the sole function of the
director's predilections and
prejudices) it provides matter
for critical hair splitting and
squabbles.
Pagla Ghoda is one of the
finest theatrical creations of
the sixties. The point is
whether it has stood the test of
time. Are we mentally prepared today to accord it the
value- based emotional credibility needed to fully savour
it? Suppose the play fails to

evoke the required response.
Then is the purpose of the
production defeated? No. If
theatre is to survive it has to
have some sense of tradition. It
has to find its modern classics.
Personally I would like Pagla
Ghoda to be hailed as a modern
classic, to which we can return

every now and then. To achieve
this ambitious aim I am doing a
fairly conservative production.
Frankly, despite my reputation
of a rneddler with the written
texts, I have always tried to
project the text. In any case, this
play is so exquisitely written
that I have not felt the need to
meddle with it.
