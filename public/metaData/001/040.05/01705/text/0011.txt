THE PLAY
The play opens in a setting of
a desolate cremation ground
where four mourners have
gathered near a fiercely
burning pyre as dogs howl in
the distance. Suddenly appears
a fifth who turns out to be the
girl who had committed
suicide in her frustration in
love and had now been
brought by the four benevolent persons to be cremated.
The four mourners narrate
the events of the dead girl's life
and in the process recall their
own individual past. They
relive their own love episodes
full of happy and unhappy

lives of their beloveds who
committed suicide out of
frustration in love.
The playwright does not
intend to recreate bizarre
situations using the ghostly
atmosphere of the cremation
ground. Nor does he attempt
to underline guilt conciousness
in his characters. On the
contrary, the play is designed,
in the words of Badal Babu, to
be a sweet love story.
When Kartik throws the
poisoned drink in his glass the
words he utters are a confirmation of the playwright's
faith in life. "Everything is
possible if you live."
