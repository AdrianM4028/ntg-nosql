By some odd superstition, we regard the habit of
talking to oneself rather uncanny, a sign of senility,
or worse, insanity. It is neither. What surprises me,
on the contrary, is that so few people dare to form
words, when they are alone. They either think, or

they speak tpothers But there are

Such words, half buried in darkness, half reaching
out to light, are often used by children and old

people, by Fools in Shakespeare, by peOple huddled
in a church, by soldiers in trenches. They lead

everywhere and nowhere. Perhaps it is out of such
dim, incoherent utterances that prayers are made——

and the soliloquies. For soliloquies are nothing but
‘asides’ to God, when the rest of the world is not

listening—or pretends not to listen.
I have tried to follow some of these words in the
‘texts for solitude’. Like dry bones, they would have
lied uselessly in my cupboard, if the members of the
Repertory of NSD had not taken them out and
infused new life into them. Above all I am thankful
to Devendra Raj, who conceived the entire project
and waited patiently for two years before he was able
to realize his vision on the stage.
