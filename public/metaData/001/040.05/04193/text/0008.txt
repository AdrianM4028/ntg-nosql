conversation and nearly comes to blows with Sangikar.
When Pradumn wants to go and tight the raging ocean,
Venurati stops him from doing so, afraid of the danger to his
life. Pradumn and Venurati are in conflict again.

The plan of Sangikar materializes. A soldier disguised as
Venurati weeps before Samb. Samb approaches the weeping

woman who runs away, and soon Venurati herself enters upon
hearing her name called. Upon being asked she reveals her
fears to Samb who comforts her. Pradumn, watching all this,
believes that Venurati in betraying him for Samb. He accuses
her of inﬁdelity, but is unable to kill her because he loves
her deeply.
