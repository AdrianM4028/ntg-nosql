in their own hands and kill Pradumn. Sangikar hears this
and warns Pradumn of Vyasputra’s plan.
Scene 3
Place: The fortress

Time: The same night
Arjuna cannot recognize this ruined city as the majestic
Dwarika Of the past. He talks to Rukmini whose hostility
towards Venurati is revealed. She blames Venurati for being
the reason for Krishna’s loneliness and detachment towards life.
She also holds her responsible for their current plight.

Arjun a reveals that he has come to Dwarika to take away
all the Yadav women, as he had promised Krishna that
he would do so. In the mean time the Durgapal mentions that
Pradumn is ﬁghting the waters alone. Soon Vahru comes looking
for Arjuna. He makes fun of Arjuna who is appalled and
confused by their crudeness.
Upon hearing that Pradumn has succeeded in bringing the
ocean under control, Rukmini thinks that it is ambition,

not love, that motivates Venurati to love Pradumn. She bribes
her with promise of great wealth and power if Venurati

would give up Pradurnn. Venurati refuses.
Pradurnn enters tired and wounded. He relates how he was
attacked from behind while ﬁghting the waters. Just then the
death of King Ugrasen is announced by Vyasputra, with
the news that Sarnb and Vabhru are ﬁghting over the
kingdom.
Sangikar, who has turned against Pradumn, asks for Samb’s
help in defeating Pradumn. Samb refuses.

Pradumn and Sangikar ﬁght. The latter is mortally wounded.
Pradumn is lost in self—questioning and regret after his
friend’s death. Urged by the Durgapal, Pradumn prepares
to ﬁght for the throne.
Arjuna rescues the women from the city and takes them .
away to Hastinapur. Rukmini tells Arjun to take Venurati

too, since she does not want Venurati to be queen of Dwarika.
Arjuna protests, but, is silenced by Rukmini. Venurati
follows, a prisoner.
