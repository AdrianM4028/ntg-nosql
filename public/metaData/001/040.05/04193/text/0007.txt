citizens of the purity of their love and lead the city back to
peace and prosperity, while Sangikar tells Pradumn that love
has weakened him. He should instead ﬁght for the throne like a

man. Pradumn refuses to give up Venurati, but agrees to return
to Dwarika with her.

Scene 3
Place: The fortress at Dwarika
Time: Evening.
Vyasputra warns the citizens of Pradumn’s arrival in the city

and urges them to put the sinner to death and save the city.
The beggars taunt him.

Vabhru and Samb both wish to hear from Jara what Krishna’s
words had been. Just as they are ﬁghting over Jara, Vyasputra
enters with news of Pradumn’s arrival in the fortress. He
disclosed his plan to lure Pradumn to them with the false story
of Jara being executed by the citizens, so that when Pradumn
comes to save Jara he can be surrounded and killed. His plan
nearly succeeds when Sangikar and his man come to Pradumn’s

rescue.
The crowd is neither with Vabhru and Samb, nor with
Pradumn. They feel that they are being crushed like insects
in this merciless struggle for power between the brothers.
Jara tries to tell Pradumn of Krishna’s death, but cannot

speak. He then relates the story by a wild dance of gestures
and signs. Rukmini is overcome with tears.

Venurati feels the shadow of Krishna falling between her and
Padumn and separating them.

The two guards are talking when Sangikar enters. He is
disappointed in Pradumn for not ﬁghting for the throne, and in
his heart blames Venurati for this. From one of the soldiers
Sangikar gets the idea of estranging Pradumn and Venurati
by letting Pradumn think that Venurati is in love with Samb,
who resembles Krishna.

The Durgapal and Sangikar argue about the relationship

between Pradumn and Venurati. The former defends it
