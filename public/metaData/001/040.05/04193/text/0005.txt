The School is grateful to Smt. R. Alkazi who has been kind
enough to design and supervise the making of the costumes,
to Shri Mohan Upreti for composing the music for the Songs

and singing those of the Vridh, and to Guru Singhajit Singh of
Triveni Kala Sangam for training the students in sword ﬁghts.
