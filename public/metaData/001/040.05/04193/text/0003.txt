Dr. Lakshmi Narayan Lal’s play SURYAMUKH attempts to
expose the violence, callous self-interest and rejection of all
civilised values which the tussle for power brings about.
It is set against the popular myth of the Mahabharata, at that

period which saw the downfall of Dwarika after the death of
Krishna.

The play reveals that in the brutal conﬂict of those terrible
times the only feature that redeemed the human condition was
the tender love between two beings.

Dwarika f'oundering on the rock of mutual acrimony and selﬁsh
greed has much in common with the contemporary situation.
