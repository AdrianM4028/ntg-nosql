3. A Catching Infection: Fun

It is signiﬁcantly hard to ﬁnd
As for the hero, Shaw’s less

gifted succssors have developed
his refreshing view that heroes
are not models ot good conduct
and that heroism consists of an

impenetrable but exceedingly
lively hotchpotch of the most
contradictory qualities, they

have arrived at the lamentable
conclusion that there is no such
thing as either heroism or heroes,
Probably in Shaw's view this is
unimportant. He seems to ﬁnd
less point in living among heroes
than among ordinary men.

Shaw's approach to composing
his works is completely aboveboard, He has no hesitation in
writing under the incessant
supervision of the public, To
give extra weight to his
judgments he helps to make that
supervision easter, he keeps
emphasising his own

out anything abOut what other
European writers think, But I
take it that where litrature, for
instance is concerned they all

share more or less the same
view, namely that writing is a
meloncholy business. As usual
Shaw, whose views about
anything under the sun are far
from unknown, d’ffers from his
colleagues here, (It is not his

fault, but at most an
embarrassment to him, a thorn

in his side, if his vast difference

of opinion with all other
European writers, covering
almost every subject in the
world, is not thrown into
sufficiently clear relief because

the others refrain from voicing
their views even when they have

any.) At any rate Shaw would at
least agree with me on this

point, that he likes writing.
