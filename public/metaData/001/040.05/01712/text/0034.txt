The Boat is Ready and Bound

Our Flag is Red
Red is our flag comrade
Our flag is red!

There is a storm in the river
And the waves are wild

We have to cross the river
When the tyrant becomes too
oppressive
And there's no way out
What shall be our slogan
Our slogan shall be strike

Though the waves are wild

Red is our flag comrade

The sun has suddenly disappeared
There is darkness all round
Can you see the deep darkness?
In the black sea of darkness

Our ï¬‚ag is red!

I

Of the workers and peasantry this
flag
Of all oppressed humanity this
flag
Of all lovers of liberty this flag
Into its making have gone
Centuries of sorrow
Red is our flag comrade
Our flag is red!

Though the waves are wild friend
The boat is ready and bound
They sky is overcast

Our world is now drowned
The waves are standing boldly
Like an impenetrable wall
But friend the boat is ready and
bound
Though the waves are wild friend
The boat is ready and bound

Love to all friends proclaiming

Hungry crocodiles wait anxiously
in the river
The wind cuts like a knife

War to all enemies declaring
The blood of the workers' heart
carrying

And the sails are torn to shreds
The oars too are in pieces
But courage alone courage alone

How high is this flag flying

Red is the bloodied flag of
revolution
Red is our flag comrade
Our flag is red!
Our flag shining like a star
Raging like a storm
Fluttering like a flame
A red flame of revolution
Red is our flag comrade
Our flag is red!

remains

Though the waves are wild friend
The boat is ready and bound.
