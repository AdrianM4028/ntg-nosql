The Mountain of Tyranny
On the other side flows the river of

Sky-high rises the Mountain of
Tyranny
Under its suffocating shadow
I cannot live I cannot breathe

milk and honey
On this side the desolate winds

sting
This side is a barren desert
There are no trees no flowers

There are thorns here at every

footstep
There are roses beyond I cannot
see
Under this mountain there is pain
and misery
On the other side lies the valley of

joy
There is desolation at home
There is desolation at heart

Sky-high rises the Mountain of
Tyranny

Under its suffocating shadow
I cannot live I cannot breathe

Sky-high rises the Mountain of
Tyranny
Under its suffocaing shadow
I cannot live I cannot breathe
Now cry long live the Revolution

With all your might grapple the
hand of oppression
Maybe together we can crush this

oppressive Mountain
Sky-high rises the Mountain of
'I'yrany

Under its suffocating shadow
I cannot live I cannot breathe
