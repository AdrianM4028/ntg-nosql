Sephistication
in the

trucking business r
used to mean
a driver

with a waxed
moustache;

For years the road transport industry believed
in just coming and going. Sophisticated
business practices were unknown Result:
instead of your goods you were often
ak‘en fer a ride.

Then came TCI. A new breed of transporters.
People who understood receiving, despatch
and handling of goods.
And TCI grew as yoor business grew: From
a single truck company to the top In its field,
This transformation has been possible
because of the confidence you've shown
in TC l . We are living up to it with
determination and efficiency.
