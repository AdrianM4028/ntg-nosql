Your Help is Needed
‘Song of Asia’ was created at the international
Moral Re-Armament Training Centre at Asia Plateau
in Panchgani in May, 1973.
Equipping the show and carrying its cast of 50
over considerable distances naturally costs a lot.
How have these costs been covered?
The ﬁrst contribution to the ‘Song of Asia’
fund came as a result of a decision by a young lady
to sell her brand new tape recorder. A young couple
from Papua New Guinea sold their car, refrigerator
and radiograrn to come to India and participate in
the show. An Australian school teacher and an
Indian journalist emptied their bank accounts. A
village headmaster whose two daughters are with the
show gave Rs 200. Others in the cast gave what
they could.
In every place they have visited in Tarnilnadu,
Kerala, Karnataka, Assam, Meghalaya, W. Bengal
and Bihar, the cast have received generous hospitality.
They have been welcomed as guests in many homes.
Contributions in money and in kind have been made
by the men and women who have invited them to their
respective cities. To transport equipment from Calcutta to Gauhati and back, trucks were given free.
In another town diesel was gifted by a businessman
for the vehicles to go to the next town.
The principal and staﬁf of a school in the Nilgiris
collect money every month and send it to some
members of ‘Song of Asia’ to help support them.

The cast of ‘Song of Asia’ have been sparked by
the vision of a new Asia and a new world. They are
ready to work hard and at no pay to give practical
shape to this vision.
