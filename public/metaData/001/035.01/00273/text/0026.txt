What is its programme?
It has a four point programme: (1) Change yourself. (2) Change others. (3) Save a crumbling
civilisation. (4) Reach the millions.

Isn’t it the system that needs to change?
Yes, Unjust and ineffective systems must be
changed. But experience shows that unless a change
of system is accompanied by a change in men’s
motives, the new system will quickly inherit the defects
of the old.

Hans Bockler, founder of the German

Trade Union Movement after the War, said, “When
men change the structure of society changes. When
the structure of society changes men change. Both
go together and both are necessary.”

Is MRA religious?
M RA is a common platform for all men who want
to see a different world. It is not a new religion but
a new determination to put age old principles into
action. It helps those who have a religion to live it
effectively. Mavalankar, ﬁrst Speaker of the Lok
Sabha, said, “Moral Re-Armament is the old, ancient
way of the East. It has given our philosophy a new
orientation and it has given it wings."
How do you reach people?
By every modern rneans—word of mouth, personal example, mass meetings, ﬁlms, radio, television,
magazines, theatre. Books and ﬁlms of MRA are
available and can be obtained by writing to 3/5

How do you change people?
By giving them hope that they can be diﬁerent,
and that by being different they can help society to be
diﬁerent. “As I am so is my nation. If the way I
lived was multiplied 550 million times, would India be
a better country or worse?” That is a question every
Indian can ask himself honestly. Merely telling other
people to change will have either no elTect, or an
opposite reaction. But if you tell people what a

rascal you have been and how you have changed
many will be interested.

What is MRA doing to answer poverty?

plans, but also determined and incorruptible men and
