DIRECTOR'S NOTE
vHATYA" in Sanskrit encompassed three
torms viz. Music Danca and Drama. Three for ms are used in traditional
lndian Theatre aithouge all three disciplines have their independent
ldeniltu uet r‘luslc ahd Dance both must become a language themselves
and compliment the story. Music 6 dance used in the drama has also

been discussed in Natua Shastra where in it has been stated that these
do not become in independent attraction in the play but these must
enhance its overall effect

The plot; "SAVA SEQ KAHAK" is basically incorporated to; the
Great tilndl'erier Late MUnshi Drem chand's storu ‘SAVA SEQ GEHOON".

i would like to highlight the Dogrl Folk Music as a tool to beautify
the Slow. Dial; has in its lid the enulorat experimentation over the
existing folk form of Dogri Musrc “KADKAH”. The form is being
replaced bu tho performers in place of traditional folksrngers. I bring

about certain innovations to modifu the start; to present dag needs.
