Director’s note

guru. i Due ३ to" ३ some: wagon the play
was cancelled. But I . was smitten with
the Beckett drama. I resolved that, as
Nasiruddin Shah was my guru, I would
show him how I interpret, direct and

produce the play. While working on
waiting. for Godot I first consciously
got rid of the notion that I was handling
a world famous and epoch making play;
instead, I just tried to get at the core
and essence of what Beckett wanted
to state. When I did that, confusions
and conflicts, contradictions and te—
nsions of day —to - day life as well as

Waiting for Godot was, for me, a
happy accident. It changed my life. In
this play, I found a vindication of the
axiom that good literature makes one ’s
life richer.
I was to enact the role of Vladimir
in this play Under the ”direction of
Nasiruddin Shah, whom I consider my

problem in leading a rational life became
manifest. It became possible to touch
upon universal human sentiments. We
gradually discovered that the play was
nothing but our own story. When we
realised this, staging the play was as
easy as anything.
The only thing I consciously tried to
do was to ensure that verbal expressions
of the actors and their body movements
blended into what Beckett called a
‘ ‘symphony’ ’ .
It there are any faults and flaws in
the production, I am responsible for
it. The credit for all that is good in
this production goes to my artist
colleagues and, of course, Nasiruddin
Shah.
