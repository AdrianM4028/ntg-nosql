significance and the purpose of the
philosophy in western culture. In
western culture existentialism is an
answer to Idealistic point of view and
Romanticism. Existentialism shows
what is missing, what they fail to grasp
and the rigidity, limitations of the
thought. So it is not only the attack
on the thought, but it is constructing
a new way of life. It is not only the
movement in literature but it is also
the new school of philosophy saying
life first and value follows, you have
to live, you must live and through your
living the value evolves. Man is not
at the centre of the world and you
can’t control nature. Rationality cannot
give answers to every problem and it
has its own limitations. Thus in western
philosophy there is a tradition of cultural
and moral thoughts, of which Marathi
people are not aware. So we miss the
point, we miss the meaning. We do
no catch the exact cultural significance
or, traditional meaning, and therefore
there is much confusion about the idea
of Absurd, and too much fuss. Still
there is a fashion to talk about Absurd
