About Samuel Beckett
Among the major writers of the 20th
century, Samuel Beckett stands out by
virtue of the uncompromising austerity
and purity of his approach to literature.
His work, though seasoned with a bitter
humour, is a.dedicated and courageous
exploration of his stark perceptions of
the transitoriness and insignificance of
human em‘stence in a bleak universe. ,
Whether his work took the form of
narrative prose, poetry, criticism, or
drama, this boldness in seeking ultimate
truths made his writings invaluable
documents of human experience and
of the workings of man’s consciousness.
At the same time, the writings
represented important contributions to
existential philosophical thought, which

is concerned with human experience at
its most concrete and specific as the
basis of all more general concepts and
मृ"
values.
Writing in both French and English,
and traslating his works from one to
the other, Beckett was an incomparable

stylist in both. His output in verse
is small, but his narrative and dramatic
prose is so delicately phrased, so subtle

in its rhythms, and so intricately
structured that it too must be considered
poetry.
