The title of the play BAAGH (Tiger) may not be as deceptive

as it appears.

‘I am a tiger -— I can do anything 1 like’ says Baagh to the young
lady whom he brought forcibly at his residence at night. The
lady was frightened; but she picked up courage and understood
what had made the man to call himself a Baagh (tiger)

Was it insanity or frustration or anything more than that and even
deeper, keeps us guessing.
