SWAAD

People in general are strictly bound by the circumstances he
lives in. He may aspire for anything, may imagine in any way he
desires, but the inevitable must happen in its own way. The rule

of the vampire, the have-s over the have nots will perpetually prevail.
'I‘hakurmosai, Shovalal, K alu, Pagol, Mastermosai and so
on all are the victims of this unbalanced equation cf life. Each and

everyone has had some aim in life in the past but owing to social
and economic conditions they all have compromised with the
inevitable. 'I‘hakurmosai is struggling hard to keep his identity
intact whereas others have lost hopes and had succumbed to this.
The blood- sucking vampire has not even spared the cemetary.
This sacred land is eventually fallen easy prey to the vampire. The

: dead bodies keep rushing in and the vampire’s blood—sucking
continues.
In this play the berserk vampire keeps everyone on his toes and
let the inevitable take its own natural course.
