What is so unique about this workshop is that the children are not auditioned,
but admitted on a first-cum-first-serve basis & knowledge & experience in theatre
is not really important.

By the time the plays have been produced & prepared we have learnt what it is
to be 'patient with one another & what it is to give & take.
A very important & integral part of the workshop are the exercises which relax
oneself physically & mentally & train the mind & body to have complete control
& command over the mental, physical & emotional being. These exercises
being yogic in nature improve the growth & development of the mind & the
hearing & speech faculities.
A child learns about one of the oldest forms of Art in our cultural inheritanceDrama. It is educative & at the’ same time a release for our emotional expres-

sions. Talent & creativity which is in‘ abundance in a child is brought to thefore,
givmg the child a sense of responsibility & achievement.
