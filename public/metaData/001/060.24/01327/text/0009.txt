Ek Daheli
"Ek Daheli" adapted from a famous Japanese folktale 'Taro & his Grandmother‘
tells the story of how in our day—to—day dealing with human relationships we
tend to see the old people around us as useless, unproductive without any

drive. What we don't realize is that no matter what, they are years ahead of us
in experience & wisdom & the way life without the sun is not possible, so also
life without them would be chaotic. When we call out to them, they are there,

right behind us with moral support, advice & sound counsel. "lka Daheli" projects
just that. In the time of crisis, the Raja banishes all the old people from his
kingdom, because he feels they are "bekaar" (useless) when the giant, after

eating all the food, wants to eat the people, they ask him to set them free, the
giant tells them that if they can solve a riddle, he will set them free again. To
the people rescue comes in form of the Grandmother's wisdom & only she
knows the answer to the riddle. Time proves the proverb " Old is Gold" in
whichever way you look at it.
