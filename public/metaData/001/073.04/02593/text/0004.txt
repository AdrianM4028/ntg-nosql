I The individuality of Kama is recognized as that of the great warrior who ﬁghts his destined fate, rejects
divine inspiration and blessing, and loses out standing manfully on earth. He is the opponent to the
divinely-declared dhaima of Aryan integration. Throughout his life he is a sufferer even in the way he is
killed.
This performance is weaved into a text that questions the relevance of his suffering and sacriﬁce while
locating Kama at the root of his people, the exploited, the oppressed, and those derecognized of any kind
of valour and intelligence. Ultimately, it reminds us .. . if he could transcend the suffering and the sacriﬁce
of a personal end and come out as the real representative of his people, Kama would emerge as an epic inspiration of a martyr
in our collective memory in this time of historical awareness. The spirit of Kama strikes at our social and political conscience :
“I was not for myself. Really I was bound to have belonged to the Sudras, the outcastes, for divine glory because I was set within
their will, as I was unavoidably an offspring of my Aryan author. Alas! any historical sense of identifying my suffering with my
people was not to be.”
