PROJECT ON THEATRE FOR THE RITUAL OF SUFFE ’ ‘

The Project is envisaged to :
React reverentially to the lessons of our ancestors, of living in the sense of powerlessness and at the same time in the
consciousness of power, in order to confront the suffering of genuine pain and anguish;
Locate the suﬁering in a holier experience and lift it to a higher consciousness of great service as an educative and healing
agency, in order to identify with a new human character of the practical mind for sacriﬁce; and
Rediscover the Meitei Mandap or similar evironrnents as the performance approach for the ritual of suffering, while making it
transparent through the heritage of celebration and striking at the root of the community experience of theatre.
The Sportive theatre of a poetic vision in the Kalakshetra Manipur (KKM) tradition has been critically re-examined, analyzed and
conceived afresh as a performance art to make its functions rooted, direct and democratic while communicating, healing and
ritualling creatively.

And to overcome the boredom of serious art and the silliness of popular art as well. However, art is not to be simpliﬁed for the
sake of rationalization or for the easy grasp of the spectators, but made simple enough so that it appeals to both their critical
mind and naturally creative faculty. Theatre, in its changing identity in our social and historical experiences, shall transform all
its resources of art and material into a complete ideology shaped by reason of and faith in humanity.
