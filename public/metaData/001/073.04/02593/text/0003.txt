LAJJA
laﬁa, the controversial novel by Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin, is a savage indictment of religious
extremism and man’s inhumanity to man.

The Duttas - Sudhamoy, Kironmoyee and their two children, Suranjan and Maya - have lived in Bangladesh
all their lives. Despite being part of the country’s small Hindu community, which is terrorized at every
opportunity by Muslim fundamentalists, they refuse to leave their country as most of their friends and
relatives have done. Sudhamoy, an atheist, believes with a native mix of optimism and idealism that his
motherland will not let him down. Then, on 6 December 1992, the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya in India is ’7 ३ _. _ _ _ ८ ३ _ ﬂ; _ V A दि: .demolished by a mob of Hindu fundamentalists. The world condemns the incident, but its fallout is felt most acutely in Bangladesh,
where Muslim mobs begin to seek out and attack the Hindus. The nightmare inevitably arrives at the Duttas’ doorstep - and their world
begins to fall apart.
This theatre version concerns the dark and menacing suffering caused by the insanity of violence. Inescapable conditions from a
series of shame ﬁnally lead human beings to commit the cowardice of sacrificing their long-cherished faith in genuine pain and
anguish.
