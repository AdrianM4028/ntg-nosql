”‘Dance like a man"
Primetimes twelth production "Dance like a man"
is a powerful human drama that is new and exciting.
Written in English, by a talented Indian writer, it looks at
the contemporary social scene in India with human,
drama and insight. The story of Jairaj and Ratna (two
dancers past their prime) is juxtaposed with that of their
daughter's Lata, to reveal the darker secrets of family
relationships and the conflicts between generations. The
mode is comic rather than tragic but the concerns are
serious real and universal. "Mahesh Dattani
one of
India's best and most serious contemporary playwrights
writing in English" - INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE.

ﬁance like .2 man
"An excellent script, with layers of profoundity
and poetry. Despite this, the play has its lighter
moments. The playwright probes below the surface of
the characters to question their deeper motivations,

and in doing so, produces lines of remarkable insight
and power .... The script transcends time and space,
comedy and tragedy.
