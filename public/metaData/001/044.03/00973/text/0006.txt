narration. This does not mean
that Akutagawa lacked concern
with the problems of reality and
self or that he tried to avoid
dealing with them. By borrowing
stories and taking the reader
away from immediate
reality,
Akutagawa sought to present
symbolic situatIons relevant to
all human reality. By assuming
the role of the story teller, therefore Akutagawa was only wearing
a mask which would hide the
author’s ego in the archetypal
drama contained in the stories.
One can safely say that the development of modern fiction

history of the author’s search for

How these two short stories
were made into a film by Kurosawa Akira and into a Broadway
play by the Kanins are dealt with
elsewhere in this brochure. Let it
suﬁ‘Ice hereto point out that both
Kurosawa and the Kanins were
heavily indebted to the genius
of Akutagawa who succeeded in
presenting to us a slice of our
ugly life through his keen observation and with his exacting detail
of reality. The truth uncovered in
these stories are still interesting

fascinates the viewer, it is undoubtedly RASHOMON.
