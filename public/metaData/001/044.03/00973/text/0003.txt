I am delighted that Professor Andrews Tsubaki
is directing the renowned play Roshomon in the

hational School of Drama.

The play has been

perforned several tines all over the world,films
have been made and adaptations have been frequent.
A Hindi adaptation of the play and its presentat—
ion by the second year students of the National
School of Drawn will undoubtedly have been a
stimulating experience for the students.
Roshomon deals with the crucial issue of the perception of reality, different angles and at varying

dimensions.

Professor Tsubaki trained in traditional

NUH and Kabuki, skilled in modern theatre with an

experience of Saraikala Chhau will have brought to
this production new techniques.
I have no doubt that for the students, this experience
wodld be invaluable. Exchange of Directors betWeen
countries has proved to be a very fruitful way of
collaboration and inter—change of ideas, perceptions

and techniques.

Professor Tsubaki and the students

were anxious that I send them my good wishes. I have

great pleasure in wishing them all success for this
play.
