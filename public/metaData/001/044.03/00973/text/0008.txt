vehicle for applying a liberated
mode, for within the play two
levels of time occur—present and
past. The level of reality in the
present and that of the past

should be different in their appearance and also in their impact.

Our production is unique as we
present the play in two different
modes: straight realism in the
scenes which occur in the present, and amplified expression in
the flashback scenes utilizing the
traditional theatre forms of Japan
such as Kabuki and No/Kyogen.
You may observe that actors
in the flashback scenes speak in
an exaggerated manner, adding
some musicality to their lines.
Their movements are punctuated
by pauses, called mie (a dramatic
pause practised in Kabuki by freezing a posture for emphasis).
Duel scenes show the characteristics of the stylized acting
most eloquently. Here you may
also notice the use of tsuke
(sharp wooden clapping sound
effects of Kabuki to accentuate
The

theatre arts is its immediacy to
the audience and also its freedom
in communicating to the audience

naturalistic environment. Today's
audience has grown to appreciate

theatre. In addition to the sound
effects specially composed for

music from No/Kyogen theatre
have been employed along with
those of Kabuki.
