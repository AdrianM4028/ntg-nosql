PROCESS

Through a series of lectures, films
and slideshows for over a period
of three weeks, we were introduced to the various traditional as
well as modern Japanese theatie
forms. The films on Kabuki. NO
and
Kyogen were particularly
important
because they were

cess including the actors training
in terms of movements, voice,
and speech; and make-up costume and music. Simultaneously
we were trained by Prof. Tsubaki
certain, basic movements,
in
steps, walking styles and postures of Kabuki, NO and Kyogen.
After learning these basic movements and speech
patterns,
the whole class in turns rehearsed a scene from a Kyogen play
called BUSU and each one of us
gained a considerable experience
in the stylised walking and stylised dialogue delivery—typical feature of traditional Japanese theatre. This preparatory work helped our actors later when they had
to enact stylised sequences in
the play. Individual meetings with
Prof. Tsubaki where he gave a
critical appraisal of the performance of each student with suggestions for improvement were
extremely beneficial.

more emphasis was being given
to the production process than
to the final performance which to
us was unique in Prof. Tsubaki’s
method of play production.
