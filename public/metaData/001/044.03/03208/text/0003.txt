Playwright
beckett, sarnuel (l90o-l989), irish—born dramatist, resident
since l938 in paris, who has written mainly in trench and in

1969 was awarded the noble prize for literature. he was
already well known as a novelist with rnolloy, rnalone meurt,
and l'innommable when in 1953 his tirst play en attendant
godot was produced by roger blin. two years later it was seen
in london in the author's own translation as waiting for godot,
and in 1956 it was produced in new york with bert lahr. in
it beckett abandoned conventional structure and development in both plot and dialogue in order to present dramatic
vision ot the human predicament in a world in which mankind seems to have no place. his two tramps, indecisive and
incapable ot action, wait hopetully for help which never
comes. this epoch-making play in now regarded as one ot
the masterpieces ot the theatre at the Clbsurd. it was tollowed in 1957 by timale partie, in which a blind man sits
in an empty room tlanked by two old people in dustbins. it
had its tirst pertomance in london, in the original, together
with a mime-play actes sans/paroles (actions without words).
as endgame it was produced in english in 1 958, in company
with a mongologue originally written in english, l<rapp's last
tape, in which an old man listens uncomprehendingly to
recordings he made as a young man; this was seen in paris

in 1960 as to derniere bande. endgame was seen in new
york in i958, actions without words in ]969, and krapp's
last tape in 1960. oh! les beaux iours, which is virtually a
monologue tor an actress progressively buried in earth until
only her head is visible, had its tirst production in new york
in 1961, as happy days. it was seen in english in london in
]962 and in trench, played by madeleine renaud in ]965.
comedie, first produced in germany in 1963 and in paris
and london (as play) in 1964, was a short dialogue spoken
by three heads protruding from arns which was repeated da
capo. in this and in his later plays, which include vaet vient
(come and go, 1966, london, 7970; n.y. l975) breath
cry
(l 969), which lasts about 30 seconds, beginning with the
of a newborn child and ending with the last gasp ot a dying
man, and not i (i97l; n.y., l972: london, l973). beckett
in
moved further and further away from conventional theatre
action
an ettort to convey with the minimum of speech and
at his
unawareness
his
and
man's inability to communicate
that
radio——all
tailure to conrol his destiny. beckett's plays for
and
tall (i 957), embers U959), words and music (1962),

me—
cascando (i963)—were important contributions to the
into acdium and, together with his novels, must be taken

count in any critical assessment ot his work.
