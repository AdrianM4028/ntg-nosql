and consisted of expert craftsmen and specialists trained in the
skills of aging and giving the object created, a life of their own.
Brechts work stands out as being signiﬁcant in the Indian
context from the point of social relevance. Designs for his productions are neither symbolic or abstract. They are rooted in
realism without becoming realistic representations. To deﬁne
the style of design, one could perhaps come closest in describing
it as selective realism, retaining only that which was necessary in
conveying the deeper meanings of his plays, and the social
context within which they took place.
Considering the fact that most of Brecht’s plays encompassed
an extensive canvas, his designers used visual elements of a
hightened or altered forms, within the framework of a realism

which the audience could identify, interpret and relate to. Not
being total representations of reality prevented the possibility

of involvement, and permitted a degree of alienation and
objectivity.

Music and Brecht
Plays of Brecht have a lot of music and songs yet we can’t call
them musicals, since the function is more of narative. ‘Three
Penny Opera’ is perhaps an exception.

Word and sound of it is primarily to explain and analyse the
latent meanings and patterns of events and not to create mood
effect.
Tunes have to be evolved out of social ethos whatever is the
back drop of the play—but the tunes are not to be used to
establish location etc. as such. Rather it is to provide an audio
back ground to the words so that words are underlined and not
drowned.

I have done music for four or ﬁve Brecht plays. Progressively
I have tried that abstraction of music should not overwhelm
the tale.
