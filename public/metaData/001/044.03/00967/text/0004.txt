Born in 1926 in East Prussia, Siegfried
Lenz belongs to the frontline German
writers of the post-war period. Lenz

grew up in Nazi Germany. At 17 he was
drafted into the navy. He deserted the
navy at the end of the war, though
pursued by Hitler’s secret police. Later,
Lenz worked for the British as an
interpreter. For some time he studied
philosophy, English and comparative
literature at university, financing himself
in part by dealings in the black market.
From 1951 to date Lenz has been a
free—lance writer. He received several
honours for his literary work, the latest
being the coveted Peace Prize (1988)
of the German Book industry and
Trade. He has written a number of
short stories and novels. Besides Ze/t
der Schu/d/osen, his significant plays
include House to House Search (1963),
Face (1964) and Blindfold (1 970). This
is the first time a Lenz play is presented
in Hindi.
