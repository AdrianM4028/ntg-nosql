innocence are reversed with
bewildering rapidity.
The play investigates these issues,
most important being the problem of
collective guilt, particularly relevant of
the trials of Nazi war criminals, but does
not end there. Changing political
attitudes stress another aspect of the
play—the problem of terrorism. Those
who claim to act for the betterment of
society and greater freedom for man
betray an ideological certainty that is, to
Lenz’s mind, suspect. It is such
mistakeable conviction that leads to the
abuse of freedom and the tyranny of
man over man.
It is a drama of ideas in which action is
reduced to minimum. The form, that of
a debate, leaves the debate for the
audience to take up. The dialectic of
guilt and innocence never ends, but will
continue as man’s history progresses.
This production of the play is an
academic exercise for the students
who are at the initial stage of their
theatre training. The emphasis therefore
was on the process rather than the end
product. We invite you to witness the
work in progress.
