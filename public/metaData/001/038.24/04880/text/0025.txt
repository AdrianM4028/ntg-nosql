As Norman Mailer world say : “Directing a play is a cross betWeen a
circus, a military campaign, a nightmare, an orgy and a high". That’s the

reason I have chosen to direct Sakharam Binder.

I dedicate it to two of my

oldest and ablest professional colleagues—R.K. Dhingra and Feisal Alkazi.

Dec. 1977
