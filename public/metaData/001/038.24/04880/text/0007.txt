for my conduct as a director and perhaps the explanation of much of the nonsense written and said about me.
About my emphasis on the form basically, I am a lover. I adore beautiful women and love beautiful plays. But I want to be a good craftsman not
land up as just a mere showman. For myself, I believe that the things I have done
are neither as good as the friendly voices make them» out to be, nor as bad as
the reaction to that reaction would make them seem. They are just in between.
A lot is generally spoken about originality. | find it foolish. I feel it is
perfectly natural for artists to borrow from each other. I have a lot of regard
for Raj Kapoor's films. On a personal level, my father, my mother, my two
sisters have meant a great deal to me. Perhaps that explains my dedicating
the production of "Happy Days” to them.

The production of “Puraskar” was

dedicated to Medha Gujral, Like wise “The Fall” was dedicated to Suman
Rai. ”Wlld Strawberries to Ayesha Kagal and Tani Sandhu; “Tughlaq” to
Arnita Kagal and Rajiv Bhargava all of whom have contributed to me greatly in
person and profession. Feisal Alkazi has always been encouraging, so have
been Om Shivpuri, a school teacher and light technician—R.K. Dhingra.
People often ask me what are my intentions in doing plays. I only want
to direct plays—plays about conditions, tensions, pictures, rythrns and characters
which are in one way or another important to me.

PERIOD.
