reaction. If the audience does not react one way or another, it is an indifferent

one critic admits "Some critics failed to understand why such painfully elaborate sets were thus, constructed”.
There is no question about how । take to criticism. I am not hypocriti—
cally immune to it. No director can be absolutely indifferent to criticism. Those
directors who say so have to be the "know alls" or "established".

Regarding the criticism of subjectivity I confess I believe in personal
expression and subjectivity in theatre. I find myself asking my audience—’This
happened to me ? Did it happen to you, too?'——As a way of checking with other
people whether they experience things the same way । do.
Today the individual has become the highest form and greatest bane of
artistic creation. The smallest wound or pain of ego is examined under a
microscope as if it were of eternal importance. The artist considers his isolation,
his subjectivity, his individualism almost holy.
Perhaps that explains my

of the play ? Should not the whole unit move in one direction ? The more
definite and clear the ”marching orders“—the easier it is to reach the goal
