Strictly speaking, my play is not even a satire : it is a fairly objective
description of the growth of fanaticism, of the birth of a totalitarianism that
grows, propagates, conquers, transforms a whole world and, naturally being
totalitarian, transforms it totally. The aim of this play was to denounce, to
expose, to show how an ideology gets transformed into idolatry, how it seeps
into everything, how it reduces the masses to hysteria, how an idea, which
was reasonable enough for discussion at the start, can become monstrous
when leaders, then totalitarian dictators, governing islands, acres or continents, use it as a powerful stimulant, a strong dose of which has a malignant
and. monstrous effect on the “people" turning them into an hysterical mob.
Some critics blame me for denouncing evil without saying what good is. l

his resistance.

easy to rely on a system of thought that is more or less mechanical.

If I set

up a ready-made ideology in opposition to other ready-made ideologies,
which clutter up the brain, I should only be opposing one system of rhinoceric
slogans to another.

It seems to me, absurd to ask a dramatist to produce a

‘Bible’, a way to salvation; it is absurd to think for a whole world and give an
automatic philosophy : a playright poses problems.

People should think

about them, when they are quiet and alone, and try and resolve them for
themselves, without constraint;

An unworkable. solution one has found for

oneself is infinitely more valuable than a ready-made ideo|09y that st0ps men
from thinking.

Originally performed in the opening days of this year—the play emerged

as a strong protest against the growing tide of Youth Congress euphoria that
swept a lot of people along with it.

Three months later the tide became a

backlash—and the propagators of the Youth Congress those who voted in
the Janata.

Now—a bare six months later—the voice of the crowd has

begun changing again : Rhinoceros remains as relevant as it was then.
