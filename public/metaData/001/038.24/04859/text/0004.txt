Stories do not give
instruction, they do not
explain how to love a
companion or how to find
God. They offer, instead,

patterns of sound and
association, of event and

image. Suspended as
listeners and readers in the
patterns, we might

reirnagine our lives. It is
through story that we

embrace the great breadth
of memory, that we can
distinguish what is true, and

that we may glimpse, at
least occasionally, how to
live without despair in the
midst of the horror that
dogs and unhinges us.
