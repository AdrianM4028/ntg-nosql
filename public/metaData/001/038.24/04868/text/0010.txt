My hair is like pine needles srnoothened by sandpaper. My nose is like a tiny sand dune, which
often turns red. My toes remind me of five tiny people all with different characteristics. My nails are
shaped like tiny choclate footballs which have been nibbed at by my younger chochollc Sister. My
eyes are like glass panes through which I look into the world around.
My heart holds the feeling of contentment which reminds me of the- colour silver which is like an
alloy created by a mixture of metals, namely experiences of life. | live In the ocean water whose
content changes with every step in a different direction. I eat the lessons, I learn from my mistakes
and swallow the feeling of dread and clastrophobia which I feel being trapped in the dark, deep
ocean waters.

My hair is like thin thread
My palm is like a big town with lines like roads
My knuckles are like camel humps
My knees are bandaged like a mummy
Because I fell down and hurt them.
My neck is like the trunk of an old banyan tree
My heart holds excitement

Which is green in colour
Which is like money.
l am a millionaire
Who is trapped in a mouse hole and eats stinky
Cheese and drinks only
Leftover lemonade
Coke and any other liquid.

My hair is like a horse’s tail

My fingers are like cracked trees.
They pop out in the middle
My nails have a glittery blue colour!
They shine in the light.
They are ’0’ shaped rings of cartilage
My shoulders are like flat, bare islands in the
Middle of nothing.
My heart hold excitement
Like the colour orange
Like a sizzling frying pan.
| live in freedom
And eat people’s brains
And drink only what I want to,
Like tomato sauce
