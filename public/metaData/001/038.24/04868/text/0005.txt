People often think we are a toy to be entertained by. They do not real ise' we have a better memory

than them. We did not want to be so fat, it was just how God wanted us to be. We are teased
because of something we did not do! We all like to be free to be sauntering in the forest but that is
only a dream. We are slow but still swift. Big but still friendly. If you don’t harm us we won’t harm
you. You think wrong things about us. Who are we? (Elephants)

। am Scary, the lion, I am sitting under the sun, lazing around. The females have gone for hunting,
and when they return I will have the first and the biggest share! HA! HA!
The mane, which serves as a cushion, makes me look big and fierce, truly like the king of the
jungle.
Usually in my free time । laze around or do wrestling. l have challenged a cheetah the world’s
fastest animal to a race tomorrow. Though । know he will win. My speed is only 60 k.m/h. If I defeat
him tomorrow I’ll break that world record. Well we’ll see that tomorrow. Now let me sleep. Good
night

Oh! God these lions
They are just so lazy
I am fed up now
We poor lionness have to do so much of work
Hunting and looking after the cubs
And when we get late from hunting
These lions shout at us
Oh! God. Why didn’t you make
me a lion so that even 1 could
have slept all day.
