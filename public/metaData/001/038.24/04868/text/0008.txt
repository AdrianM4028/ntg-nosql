1.

Did you know that two-thirds of all the lions in the world today, live in captivity? Look up books
in your school library to find out more about this subject. How many lions are there in India
now? Where do they live? What do you think can be done to improve their situation? What can
you do?

2.

Make a puppet similar to the different snake puppets in the play. While the one for the python
was made out of cardboard boxes covered with fabric, the other two snakes are made out of

old socks!
3. Write out a conversation between different animals who meet in a 200. Make your own puppets
or masks and act it out.
4. All the painted plates in the lobby were designed by the cast members around the theme of
carnoflague. Take an old dinner plate at home and make a painting on the same theme, that
you can display too!
5.

Draw your favourite scene from the play.

6. Write a poem about any one event/scene from the play.
7. All the songs in the play were written by the children themselves. Many variations of these are
printed in the brochure. Write a song on some event of your own life or describe a day in the
life of a circus lion in verse.
8.

Over the next week collect as many articles as possible on the issues that the play dealt with.

9. What do you think happens to Sheru after the play is over?
