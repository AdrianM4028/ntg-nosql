Curious is white

Like this sheet of paper
It flies around my body
रि reminds me of my friend
It makes me want to
Work hard like a bee
IT makes me feel nervous.

Stubborness is gray
Like a road and a donkey

It shouts like a monkey
It reminds me of myself
I feel like putting
My fingers in my ear
रि makes me feel dead

Crazy is black like the dark sky
IT scares me.

It reminds me that l have to fight
With my friend.
It makes me want to shout
Like a lion
It makes me feel to play
With an alien.

Crazy mood is a whacky colour
Yellowish green moss and a lizard
It reminds me of myself.
It makes me want to shout
IT reminds me of myself.

Jump for joy do whacky things
Like a monkey.
रि makes me feel wild and happy.

”ll-lappiness is multicoloured
Like a rainbow
It sings to every body
रि reminds me of the movie Stepmom
It makes me want to play cricket
It makes me feel independent
