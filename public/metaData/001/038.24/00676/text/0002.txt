A silent play about feminine suicide as opposed to
Shakespeare’s ‘garrulity', that is over abundance of
speech by Franz Xaver Kroetz. The language of
silence universally communicates to every world
citizen regardless of nationality, caste, creed, or
colour the playwright's theme-suicide or rather feminine suicide in a man-made world. Music like
silence is universal too composed especially for this

venture by Sarod maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan.
Audio cassettes of which would be available for
sale at the shows. Directed by Arun Kuckreja, this

being Arun's twenty fifth productlon on the Delhi
stage, The production borrows paintings on the
theme of woman by renowned painter Dhiraj Chou-

dhury and photOgraphs by eminent lensrnan Raghu
Rai depicting for instance oppression of woman,

unfair male dominance, bride burning. dowry deaths,
sati, the deplorable condition of Indian widows,
society's harsh attitude towards single and divorced
woman and the general degradation of women all
over the world to assert women's plight in our world

The sole silent performer is actress Suchitra Gupta
who plays the complex role of a mute S urnan Rai, a
a middle class working woman, an obscure artist
with a hobby of painting on the theme of women, a
suﬁerer, an observer of the inhuman order we live
in or of ‘things as they are’ who ﬁnally commits

suicide.

Only if she had lived and the explosive

force resulting from exploitation and repression was

not self directed, that is against the exploited and
repressed themselves, we could have a revolutionary

situation, the production concludes in this view of
Kroetz's. The afte. math depicted in Durkhiem‘s
view holding the society, responsible for it's yet
another victim.
