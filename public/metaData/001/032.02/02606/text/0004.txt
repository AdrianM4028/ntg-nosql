APNA MORCHA

The Novel :
APNA MORCHA

is definitely the ﬁrst

and authentic record

on youth

movements. The generation which came into being around Independence and is called
youth today—how it is confronting the present set-up because of its anger, sorrow,

dissatisfaction and isolation in the colleges and Universities—is the theme of the novel.
It has been based on the language movement of 1967 in the entire Northern India

but an attempt has been to make it relevant to our own contemporary realities. And
this relevance has been underlined not in isolation but in its relationship with other
stratas of the society.

We have not adopted the novel into a dramatic structure but tried to evolve the
whole production out of novel itself in human visuals—

The Novelist :
Kashinath Singh is a significant name in the Hindi prose of 1960-70. Apart
from this novel, he has three collections of short stories—Subah Ka Dar, Log Bistron
Par and Aadminama—and a play Ghoos to his credit.
The importance of Apna Morcha lies in the fact that the novelist himself has

been connected with the students’ demonstrations not as a mere spectator, but a true
and honest participant and has analysed them in our total social perspective.
