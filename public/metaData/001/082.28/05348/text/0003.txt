A Short Sketch of Stagecraft in Bharatmuni’s
Science of Drama

When it was decided to stage Vishakhadatta‘s zl/Iudmrakshasa on
a stage specially designed as described by Bha‘ratmuni in his
Science of Drama, it became necessary to clarify some concepts.
Scholars differ about the exact period in history of Bharat-

mum. It is generally believed that Bhardtmum' composed his
science of Drama between 200 BL‘. and 200 AD. - sometime

during this period of 400 years.
When one goes through the detailed and minute discussions
on the various aspects and facets of the stage in this treatise
of Bhamtmmzi on the Science of Drama, one concludes that even
before Bharatmzmi, for centuries together, the tradition of
Indian Drama was in existence. Some scholars feel that this

tradition dates back right upto the Vedic period.
It then become necessary to note down Vishakhadatta’s exact

time too along with Bhamtmuni. But scholars diﬁer in their
opinion on this point also. According to some, Vishakhada'tta

belongs to the sixth century AD. while others believe that he is
a dramatist of the eighth century AD. jakobi — the German
scholar - maintains that the ﬁrst performance of Mudrarakshasa
was held on 2nd December 860 AD. For this Jakobi has taken
into consideration some references in Mudm'rakshasa about
Astronomy. But this opinion has not seen universally accepted.
