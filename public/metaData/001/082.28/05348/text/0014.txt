Interpretations of the Play
While every care has to be taken not to disturb the authenticity of the production, the contemporary feeling of the play

must be fully brought out. With this end in View the director
has tried to tackle some of the following issues suggested by a
study of the play:
Is it an anti-war play?

(Jan one see contemporary overtones in the political intri-

gues which help so uniquely to form the rich texture of the
pl ayP

Does the play suggest that human feelings and failings have
no place in a political game?
Does the play suggest that the political structure is more
important that the individual and that the latter has a neces~

sarily inconsequential role?

अ;

In the feud between Chanakya and Raks
hasa, iS the Ulti'
mate fate of the latter, i.e., his acceptance of Chandragupta‘s
supremacy, his defeat?

Is Chanakya, an ascetic among politicians, a possible
character in contemporary political life?
The production will truly serve its purpose on
ly when it
prompts these and similar questions in the m
inds of a contemporary evidence.
