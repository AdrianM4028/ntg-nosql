This is briefly and roughly the description of Bharatmuni’s
stage and theatre. The present production of ‘Mudramkshas’ has
taken into consideration only the total stage (Rang-Manch) as
described by Bharatmuni.
This is an attempt to present that kind of stage on the stage
of our modern times. This stage, therefore, has been honestly
presented as a replica of the stage described by Bharatmuni.
Certain changes, however, were inevitable and so they were
made. These changes, however, are only (merely) about minute
details.
