Vishakhadatta’s ‘Mudrarakshasa’

The Sanskrit theatre carries valid traces of its origins in the
religious ritual perpetuated from generation to generation. The
familiarity with which human characters commune with those
from the higher world of the deities is indicative of the role of
ritual in developing theatre practice. In the actual theatre-craft
the ritualistic element predominates in the invocation, the function of the Sutradhara and the Nati and other such elements.

The Sanskrit theatre is part and parcel of the living cultural heritage of India. Its revival is essential in a modern context
in order to help Indian theatre evolve in an authentic sense.
Theatre forms such as we know them today, except for the many
ﬂourishing folk forms, are mostly borrowed from the W'est.

THE PLAY ‘MUDRARAKSHASA’

Vishakhadatta’s Sanskrit play Mudrarakshasa is unique even
among the avoidable storehouse of Sanskrit theatre. From internal evidence it is believed that the dramatist lived during the
sixth century and that he had an intimate relationship with a
royal house. He had deep knowledge of stagecraft, and he goes
out of his way to suppress the conventional lyric emotion of
Sanskrit drama and to adopt a uniquely cerebral approach.

The central character of the play Chanakya is a politician
endowed with as much foresight as craftiness.
Chanakya, a learned scholar and a writer of political theory,

went one day to a feast given by the Nandas who ruled over
Magadha and occupied the principal seat of honour. He was
driven out by the king. He vowed vengeance on the royal house
