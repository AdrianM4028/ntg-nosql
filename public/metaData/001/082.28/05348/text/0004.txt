the linguistic evidence, many references to elephants, the im-

portance given to the worship of Lord Vishnu, the names of
non-Indian kings like Kulut, Parsik, Sindhdesh etc. and the
reference to the description of Varah Avatar at the end of the
play, one may conclude that this play was written either during
the last days of the Gupta period or immediately after the end
of the Gupta period in Indian history.

Vishakhadatta also wrote another play called ‘Dcvi Chandra
guptam’, which is not available now. From the story of this play
also one feels certain that Vishakhadatta must have belonged to
the period immediately after the end of the Gupta Dynasty and
he must have written his play ‘Mudrm'akshasa’ between seventh
and eighth century AD.

In short Bhamtmtmi had described his stage between the

Had it retained its original structure or had it changed with the
passage of time? The tradition of Indian Drama was a living
tradition and it was, therefore, bound to undergo certain changes.
50 it would be wrong to suppose and imagine that the stage
during Vishakhadatta’s times was exactly the same. That is a
replica of the stage of 500 years ago -— that is of Bharatmuni’s
times. It was bound to undergo certain changes and it did as it
can be easily seen by the suggestions about the stage in Vishakhadatta’s play. During the times of Bharatmuni, before the main
play began, the ‘Pooja’ ceremony took place. The goddess of
stage and other deities were prayed to. But later on this was
