NATAK KARACH-YA SHODHAT SAHA PATRE
6 November, 1969

This is a Marathi adaptation of Louie Pirandelo’s play
“Six characters in search of an author”. Here an attempt is
made to unravel some of the ﬁner points involved in the projection
of drama as a medium of art. The story makes you think
deeper into the eternal hide-and-seek between illusion and reality.
The characters are all peeple who had had their fair share of
kicks and knocks of the wily ways of the world. But they are
nevertheless unanimous in their View of life that with all the
sufferings and modiﬁcations, life is a beautiful thing and is worth

living over and over again.

MAJOR CHANDRAKANT
7 November, 1969

The play is based on an original Tamil play by K. Bhalchander.
This is a story of two sons of a retired blind army Major used
to rigorous discipline in life with its concomitant of dutyconsciousness and tranSparent integrity. Like any loving father,
the Major would not be wrong in expecting his sons, whom he
had brought up after the premature death of their mother, to
inculcate the same qualities. But that is not to be. Elder son
Vishram rises to a very high position by sheer dint of merit and
with all his status and authority, would respect his father and

failing in his duty would even suffer for it.

Vikram, his younger

brother, however, somehow gets into bad company and leads

a debaucherous life. He even betrays his girl-friend whom he
promises to marry. And that is the limit. The girl’s brother
kills him and takes refuge in the Major’s house. The emotional
read.
