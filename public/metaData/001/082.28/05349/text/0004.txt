PA'I‘I GELE GA KATHEWADI
8 November, 1969

The play combines the characteristics of both a traditional
drama and a folk drama. During Peshwa regime, the ofﬁcials
in the course of collection of tributes from their vassals, had
to visit far off places. One such ofﬁcial goes to Kathiawar. In
order that the husband may not entertain any suspicion about
her ﬁdelity, his wife gives him a memento of ever-fresh marigolds.
This strange bunch of flowers creates some uneasiness in the

mind of the king of Kathiawar and he hatches a plot to get
hold of it.

The secret of this ever-fresh bunch of ﬂowers is unravelled

as the plot devlopes.

Here is a play in which music serves to

highten the effect of the situation, which has been a salient feature

of the traditional Marathi stage.
