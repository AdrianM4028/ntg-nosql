“An adaptation of Death of a Salesman! Are you nuts? How
can you do that? It is a typically American playl” Remarks
like these were brandished by those who came to know that
Bhanu Bharti had chosen this play for his first production for
the Shri Ram Centre's Repertory Company and has approached rne to adapt it.
A translation wouldn't have been a problem. But then it
would have been a futile exercise in producing a world classic
(no quarrel with those who do not consider it so). An adaptation then. Placing Willy Lornan in an Indian environment was
not much of a problem. As Ramdas Kapoor, he is a refugee,
settled in Old Rajinder Nagar, 8 hosiery and knit-wear sales—
man. His elder brother Balwant (Ben) had gone away to
Africa (instead of Alaska of the original) Where many Indians
had gone—and struck gold.
With Indian topography, sounds and smells, food habits to
establish an up-coming Punjabi family, the whole play became
topical and relevant to the Indian situation. We are entering
the same phase of development now which Miller had
observed forty years ago. With our Nooveau riche and their
new found wealth, we have the same Lornan problems today.
Miller's story thus became a convenient peg to hang the
Ramdas tale on.

I've tried to keep the I ndian character as close to the original
as possible, adapting and lndianizing as much of the basic
dramatic action of the original. Despite the transplantation,
Ek Sapne Ki Maut is, more or less, The Death of a Salesman.
I would like to be judged for the effectiveness or otherwise
of these identifiable characters and their conflicts.
