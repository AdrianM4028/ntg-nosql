९८- दृकृ .«x- is «Is as श्न- PREMCHAND KASHYAP

Any introduction to Mr. Kashyap’s personality will
h be incomplete, without a mention of his youth passed in pre
independence era which composed of two devotions—love for
art and love for the country. His period at the University
was cut short by his revolutionary activities and his academic
genius burst forth into various channels of art and culture.

This attainment in poetry,music, drama through writings and
live performances bore an ample testimony that he still was
essentially a hectic patriot, who chose this speciﬁc way of

service of the nation and provided revolutionary themes to
the youth of his days.
After independence, he has become a synonym with
any cultural acrivity. He is a very reputed poet in Urdu
and some of his writings have gained a reputation of national

level- His dramas गिरती मीनारें, अभी दि-ष-ली दूर है, गहराइयों,
शहीदों की बस्ती, जड़ाऊ कंगन तथा मिलिये और पहचानिये Speak
amply of his artistic genius and patriotic f'ervour.His vocation
has essentially been social service, which earned him a seat
in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembely. His greatest

contribution has been KALAMANDIR, an art and cultural
association, making long strides towards fame and achievements of national level.
He has also been vice-president of
the Madhya Pradesh kala Parishad.
