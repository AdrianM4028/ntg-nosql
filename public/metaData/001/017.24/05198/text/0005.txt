At last, first tram's mind is also being converted to leave his
native village.

In the new sphere of employment, the two trams go here and
there to beg literary for job. Here three various rich persons masked
faces, tells them that, they don't have any job of their choice and
which they aspire for.

When asked by the masked persons who they are and from
where they have come to such a far place, they say they are from a
village. The masked persons ask them sarcastically where were they
till today for so many years of idleness?

When confussed to their extremity, an intelligent person
masked with a monkey face inspires the first tram not to dream any

more but to use his intelligence.

They suddenly, comes a person masked with a crow's face, and
tells the second tram to fly away to a further far away world. The crow

takes the second tram to tahat world.
In the village here, a machine works at its high speed to suggest
industrial development.
