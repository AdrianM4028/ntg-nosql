Under a tree sprouted with branches and twigs, two masked '
persons have gone to sleep. Afteer a while one of them who has gone
fast asleep, suddenly screams and gets up, and tries to run. But he
learns that, both of them are tied together with a rope.
In fact, the village with tree symbolizes Goa, and the two
persons are two trams-one symbolizing lazyness and other one

symbolizing labour.

-

The firtst tram tries to covinCe the second tram as to absud life

he is leading. The second tram does not change his pattern of life and
rests there to lead life as routine.
A group of chorous symbolizing the community's crosssection
comes under the tree and narrates upon the lithargy to labour which
is being rooting in the village.

a rich employer is seen under the tree the next moment, with a
hunter in his hand, he starts beating the trams physcially, and '
shouting at them to work and work. The other labourers converses
that, the employer with a hunter in his hand is though an outsider who
came in the village, has made a stable place for himself by availing
the benefit of the labour situation in the village. He has been
courageous enough to leave his home, leave his family barriors; and
he has migrated to the vilage of existing labour facility.

The chorous sings in union and provokes all ot work and work
hard, and find a dignity in law labour. The second tram is seen not
bothered to change a least.
The second tram i nfact, has long back dreamt to go to foreign

country to earn as rapidly as possible.
