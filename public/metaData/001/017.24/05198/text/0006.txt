TH E LIGHTING
Electrician

Give us light on our stage.
How can we disclose
We palywrights and actors

i:

Images to the world in semi-darkness ?
The sleepy twilight sends to sleep.
Yet we need our watchers wide awake.
Indeed we need them vigilant.

Let them dream in brightness.
The little bit
0f night that 's wanted now and then
Our lamps and moons can indicate.

And we with our acting too can keep
The time of day apart.
The Elizabethan wrote us
Verses on a heath at evening
Which no lights will ever reach
Nor even the heath itselfembrace.
Therefore flood full on
What we have made with work
That the watcher may see
The indignant peasant
Sit down upon the soil of Tavastland
As though it were her own.
