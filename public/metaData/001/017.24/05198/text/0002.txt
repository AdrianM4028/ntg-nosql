The unemployed day by day gets depressed and frustrated.
As a result, he finds himself isolated and defeated. He even
does not dare to give a date to pretty, young fiancee out of sheer
shame and self-hatred. Consequently, he has trapped himself in a
dreadful case of isolation.

One day, when lost in his world of paranoia, he catches a sight

of a poor wanderer artist drawing the i rnages of Gods and saints. He
asks himself a question - " Where on earth this unknown poor artists
is employed ‘? But the people praise his art, and throw coins at him
in appreciation ५

Another day, he happens to see a juggler family doing
clowning, jugglery, performing acrobatics in the crowded streets.
Interestingly, it is here he sees an Elephant calf lifting a fancy
umbrella by its trunk. On witnessing this, the group of spectators gets
artfused and entertained. On seeing this fine effort of the Elephant
calf, throws a number of coins at it.
Here, our poor unemployed friend ponders — " This Elephent is
calf is not a Govt. servant. But it uses its skill and intelligence to lead
itself an independent life and proves himself significant. Why should
. not I then use my own skill and intelligence ’?"
He puts his intelligence to test; - and trying hard collects some

capital and engages himself in a small scale industry in which he
prospers in due time.

He succeeds to see his small village industry of toys prOSP‘i’r
day by day.
>

Further. he employs other " needy citizens. Likewise he
becomes proud owner of his own industry, and not a crafty aspirant
for Government job.
