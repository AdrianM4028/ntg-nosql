Theatre, like other live performing arts, gives a thrilling experience to the

human beings, It is always fresh,

innovative and enriches itself through

exhilerating or frustrating experiences of human existence. The instict to act
or re-present has always been a dominant trait of man. This has been preserved,

in its primitive purity, in the tribal arts. Modern theatre is trying to rejuvinate

itself, drawing upon the roots of our cultural heritage.

It is a pleasure to learn that SANKET, Alwar is organising a theatre training

workshop, exploring the tribal arts. The fact that a graduate of the National

School of Drama,

Shri Afsar Hussain,

deing sponsored dv the

ls conducting the workshop and is

Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Akademi confirms

the

seriousness of the effort and purpose.

I wish this venture all the success.
