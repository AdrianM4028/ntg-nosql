Sincerely interested in culture, They have their own selfish interest. I am reminded of
a small incident in my school, One day a student who was also a scout behaved in a
manner which was not scout like, Wher- scout master reprimanded him and told him
that being a scout he should not have behaved thus, the boy calmly replied, ‘Sir, I
Was not in my scout uniform.’ This is exactly what is happening in the so called cul-

tural activities, Cultural activities are being planned not to achieve any cultural results
bUt to serve the self interest. I t is a pity that even those who at the heighest national
level profess to propagate culture and preserve the cultural heritage, are involved in
COiieCting object d’art as any other art dealers, old photographs even stealing them
for international festival है from private homes where they stay as guests. These persons

only तिहि 0f pronogatior and preservation of culture when they ire sitting in a confere
ence- lt cennof be help rd because these persons are the product of this
very society
which does not have em, cultural valueS.
