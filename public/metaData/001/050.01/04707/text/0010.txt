About The Play

The play starts with a scene in the Empire of
Singhaldeep when Raja Inder sends for the fairies
at his couit to entertain him with songs. Pukhraj
pari Neelam pari,Lal parz' and Sabz pari, arrive one
after the other to entertain their Lord and Master.
Raja Inder is lulled to sleep and the fairies leave

the court. Sabzpari, the fairest among the fair while
on her journey back home ﬂies over Hindustan
and spots a young prince having his seista at his
palace. She falls in love with him. She commands
"Kala Dev" to bring the stranger to the kingdom of
Inder where no earthly being had dared to set his
foot. This person with whom Sabz pari has fallen in
love is prince Gulfam. Sabz pari keeps him in bid-

ing but one day, he is discovered and this invites
the wrath of Inder upon her. Prince Gulfam is im—

prisoned in a dry well in Kalle-Kaf and Sabz pan' is
banished from the Court. The fairy (Sabz pari) is
besides herself with grief at losing her beloved. She
becomes a jogan and goes places singing songs of
separation and yearning. Time passes and her fame
spreads and one day she is invited to the Court of
Raja Inder. The Raja does not recognise her, but is
so overwhelmed with her talent in music and dance
that he offers to fulfil any or all of her cherished
desires. Sabz pari assumes her real form and asks
for the hand of prince Gulfam. The Raja recognizes
her, but keeps his word. The lovers are united.
