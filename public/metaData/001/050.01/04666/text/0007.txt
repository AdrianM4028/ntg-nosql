graduation from the institute. My reaction was
mixed with surprise and happiness, to accept or not
to accept. Finally I gave in.
The next question was which play for NSD? As I will
be directing it for the NSD repertory and my
background is also from the professional company I
decided to take a company play SADARAME
because of its simplicity and beauty with the folk
elements. This play which was written by Shri
Narahari Shastri exclusively for Gubbi Co.. The
meaning of Sadarame is “always beautiful” (sada =
always, rame = rarnya, a Sanskrit word for beauty).
The play which was written during the last century is
in Lokadharmi rather than the Natyadharrni style. It
is simple and entertaining.
The problem of this style and text is its duration. The
play with its two hundred songs was being
performed from 10PM to 5AM. There would be
song before and after every speech. Hence it was a
mind boggling experience to reduce it to two hours
with out loosing its original charm.
The characters Bangaru Shresty and Adirnurthy
belong to a business community, in the play they
represent GREED, their dialect is mixture of Telugu
and Kannada in the original play but here we have
brought it in Rajasthani and Hindi to bring out the
satire in the play.
The other major factor in this play is music. The
music is not just music but it is “Ranga Sangeet” or
‘Thratre Music’. Though the original music is in
carnatic the present music has been integrated with
Hindustani music by Smt. Anjana Puri. The first half
of the play has beauty and variations of speech
while the second half has the beauty and variations
