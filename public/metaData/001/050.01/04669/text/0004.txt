NSD at Purana Qila

The National School of Drama has a history that
spans many decades and this year we are proud

to be celebrating 50 years of our existence.
One of the special events planned as a part

of the Golden Jubilee celebrations is 7857: Ek
Safamama, a play that will be performed at the

Purana Qila from i 8 April to 25 April 2008.
The initiative to make a historical monument
a site of performance was taken in the 19605.

In the 70s the Purana Qila was ﬁrst used as
a backdrop for theatre when three of the
School’s productions - Tugh/aq, Andha Yug and

Su/tan Razia directed by Ebrahim Alkazi - were
performed against its ramparts. The event
has for us an importance that goes beyond

the grandeur and history of the monument

- it is for us a site for invoking, enlivening
and commemorating one of this city’s most
beautiful buildings by summoning a past on
which the present is built.

With NadiraZaheerBabbar’s I857:Ek5afarnama,
a play that seeks to stage the people’s role in
the country’s ﬁrst war of independence and
that is saturated with narratives from our city,
this is indeed very possible.
