Ebrahirn Alkazi was Director of the NSD and ATI from 1962 tot 977. lf
the NSD during these years was often seen as being synonymous with
its Director, it was because he played a central role in the reconstruction
of the institution, and put in place a comprehensive structure of theatre
training and research. Donning the roles of administrator, teacher and
theatre director during his fifteen—year tenure, he oversaw the growth of
the School into an institution of national and international repute.

To Alkazi, theatre was an “exacting” profession that demanded of its
practitioners a professionalism honed through discipline, rigorous study,
meticulous planning and in-depth research. Central to his vision of the
professionalization of theatre practice was the belief that students could
be trained to be effective all—round theatre workers.

The changes that Alkazi made revealed a distinctly modernist imperative,
with the attempt being to develop a holistic approach to theatre training .
First he redesigned the integrated programme to three years with
specializations in Acting, Direction and Stage Design. The courses
were envisaged as broad-spectrum, while also delineating precise
methodologies relevant to specializations.

Another change that Alkazi introduced was the emphasis on play
production as a crucial component of the training process. While earlier
training had involved students doing class-room exercises with one-act
plays, they were now required to work on full-length texts which were
invariably mounted as public productions.
