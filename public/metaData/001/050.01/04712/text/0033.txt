n the decade following Independence there was a growing desire to
create a national institution for the development of a national theatre. This

Discussions linked the question of Indian identity to the reinvention of

classical drama and traditional / folk performance where the urge to
explore modern and experimental idioms of performance was also

National School 'of Drama began to take root. It was felt that a centralized
institution could promote pedagogy and research and give shape and
