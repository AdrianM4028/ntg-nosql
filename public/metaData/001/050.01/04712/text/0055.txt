The aim of the programme is to educate children through
entertaining, creative and meaningful theatre. For this
purpose, the TIE Company has started several forward—

for children and organizes performances in various schools.
Theatre workshops conducted with children received such
a tremendous response that now the Company’s intensive
summer workshops and Saturday/Sunday clubs have
become a regular feature in Delhi schools. The TlE also
trains teachers through workshops to create theatre or to
acquire skills to make classroom learning more enjoyable.
