The earlier emphasis on the public staging of school productions also
came in for revision. There was a view that the investment of time
and energy in public productions often came at the cost of classroom
teaching. More importantly, the demands of public performance dictated
that the best roles were given to the most talented actors, thus creating
‘star’ actors who were given repeated opportunities while the majority of
students were given a chance to develop. The School now introduced
a policy of in—house productions which allowed many more students to
participate in theatre meaningfully.
