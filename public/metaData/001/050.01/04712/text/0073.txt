The Director’s Note

about him, the more my interest in him grew, fueling my need to acquire
greater information about him. In this context, l was inspired to do this
production by a bringing together of his memoirs, his letters to his father,
Felicia and Milena; his views on theatre, art, literature, cinema and youth;
and the effects of World-War 11. Letter to Father is my launch pad and
it is based on this that we analyze his reactions and views on different
subjects. I am very thankful to Mr. Bansi Kaul, Mr. Asif Ali Haider Khan
and my team, who have been with me through the entire process of
making this play.
