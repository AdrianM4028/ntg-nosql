Challenges of a new

Anuradha Kapur

Anuradha Kapur, the present Director, has been a professor of both
Acting and Direction at NSD for over two decades. This provides her
with a perspective to steer the training programme of the School in a
direction which keeps abreast with the imperatives and requirements of
a new internationalisrn in the arts.

Concomitant with the projects of expansion and consolidation, in the
late 19908 we see the beginnings of an engagement with new theatrical
languages. Around the 19905 theatre directors had begun to experiment
with video and new media technologies, and these experiments became
available to students. Over the last few years students have begun
creating cross-genre work as part of their projects.
The use of these media in the theatre is an inevitable response to the
rnediatizing of society in our times. What shape it takes in the Indian
context, what use it is put to, what meanings it generates are questions
that will be debated by all those who see theatre as a dynamic medium
and a significant social force.
