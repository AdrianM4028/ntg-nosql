experimentation across genre and media. Evident here is a sense of
School’s growing confidence in its role and position as an institution of
national import.
Ramgopal Bajaj, who became Director in 1995, launched three major
institutional initiatives: Jashne Bachpan, the annual children’s theatre
festival; the Bria/at Rang Mahotsav, a national theatre festival; and Ba/
Sangam, a bi—annual festival for children trained in the traditional forms.
Jashne Bachpan and Ba/ Sangarn were initiatives that developed and
extended NSD’s investment in the TIE programme.

Bharat Rang Mahotsav was designed to bring together and give visibility
to the large variety of performance forms that comprise Indian Theatre.
The period also saw the starting of significant theatre journals. Theatre
India in English and Rang Prasang in Hindi. The journals were intended to
foster debate and discussion on theatre related issues at a national level.

Devendra Raj Ankur was Director of N80 between 2001 and 2007. His
longstanding interest in the project of documentation and publication
came to fruition during these years. Ankur's primary concern was with the
compiling and consolidation of archives related to Hindi theatre especially
the reprinting of significant historical documents. lrnportant anthologies.

encyclopedias and texts were added to the NSD‘s publication list during
his tenure.
