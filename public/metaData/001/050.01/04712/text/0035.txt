Conference in Mumbai. In the decade following the war, both UNESCO
and BNS were interested in building an internationalist theatre movement
which would work for world peace. The Conference recommended the
establishment of an Asian Theatre Institute (ATI) in India which would
reconstitute traditional Asian performance forms that had suffered under
colonialism, impart theatre training, and create pan-Asian networks
among theatre practitioners.

Consequently, the ATI was founded in January 1958 with the support of

UNESCO. It started a year-long training program in two specializations—
Rural Theatre and Children’s Theatre. The SNA gave the fledgling
institution a princely grant of Rs.9,5OO in the first year. The following
year, the ATI was merged with the newly proposed National School of

Drama.

Thus a new set—up, called the National School of Drama and Asian
Theatre Institute, came into being in April 1959.

Mr. Satu Sen, a renowned lighting designer was appointed as the
first Director of the NSD. The School designed an integrated two—year
programme, which focused on Dramatic Literature and Theory, Acting,
and Production. Interestingly enough, the pedagogic emphasis seems
to have been on the theoretical underpinnings of a ‘realist’ or ‘illusionist’
drama, while also attempting to incorporate the methodologies of Indian
Sat u Sen

dramatic theory.
