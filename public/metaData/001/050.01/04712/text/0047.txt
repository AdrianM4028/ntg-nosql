Kirti Jain became Director in September 1988. She began to rethink
and restructure pedagogic modes and the syllabus. The existing faculty
was strengthened through the inclusion of visiting faculty with a view to
developing a modern aesthetic in keeping with new and exciting trends
in theatre training. The attempt was to combine Karanth‘s approach
with a well—organized and rigorous training module which strengthened
all aspects of acting and play production. Specializations were also
restructured. In her tenure, she instituted the Theatre-in-Education
Company (Tl E) and the Regional Resource Centre, Bangalore.
