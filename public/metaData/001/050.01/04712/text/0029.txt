MESSAGES
DR. ANURADHA KAPUR
DIRECTOR
NATIONAL SCHOOL OF DRAMA

Any arts training institute must endeavor to be sensitive
to the changing aspirations and needs of young people
who have elected to pursue a vocation that is both risky
and insecure as it is about becoming human through art
practice. Creating more opportunities for theatre practice
and training is, therefore, significant because it provides a
new dynamic to the theatre movement. The National School
of Drama, in this context and in the course of its fifty-year
history, has sought to develop training methodologies that
have been put in place by a dedicated team of teachers,
trainers and practitioners who have attempted to be
mindful of the varying demands of theatre in our times.

In a world that is often all too ready to standardize
education ' and arts practice, I hope opportunities to

explore different ways of theatre thinking through training
will create young artists who are alert and sensitive to the
world around them.
