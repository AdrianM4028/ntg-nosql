New Directions,

B. V Karanth

By the 19703 the national consensus upon which institutions such as
the NSD had functioned since the 19608 was beginning to break-down.
Forms of regional assertion had begun to interrogate the Nehruvian
model of the centralized institution. B.V. Karanth who became Director
of NSD int 977, responded to these articulations by attempting to forge
a representative “contemporary idiom” which drew upon indigenous
performance practices.

Karanth saw his contribution to the institution as an effort to dernocratize
and decentralize its functioning. In a reversal of the existing system of
the three—year diploma course with specializations, Karanth set up an
“integrated” syllabus that reflected his belief that the theatre was primarily
an actor-centric medium. As he put it “. . . there has to be a solid practical
training, which determines the voice, the body and the sensibility of the
training as its nucleus. Covered alongside are all connected areas of
work—major and minor—such as stagecraft, stage technique, lighting,
direction, even script—writing.” Such an approach led to the shifting of the
school’s pedagogic emphasis from an academic engagement to handson learning in the process of production. This was a processual, artisanal
approach where one learned through participation.

There was also a substantive shift in terms of the aesthetic content
transmitted. Karanth’s own training in the Company Natak was manifest
in his perception of dance and music as central to an Indian performance
vocabulary. Emphasis was placed on training in voice and sound; Kalari
and Chauu were incorporated to teach movement. Also, gurus of the
traditional forms were regularly invited to work with students.
