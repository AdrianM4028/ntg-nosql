Repertory
Company
The NSD Repertory Company was set up in August 1964
with the purpose of establishing a professional company
that would create a climate for

serious and stimulating

theatre through regular performances. Initially started with
only four members, the Company became a full-fledged
unit in 1976. Today, it has twenty regular artistes besides

casual artistes and a team of administrative and technical
staff.
Over the years, the Repertory has provided a rich and

varied range of dramatic fare for audiences all over the
country. It has also traveled abroad with its productions.

Extension
Programme
In 1978, there was a growing feeling that theatre workers
and students spread all over the country had a right to the
resources and skills that the School had developed. With
B. V. Karanth’s initiative of a three—month long workshop in
Gandhigram, Madurai, the NSD set off a programme that
allowed the nation to participate in the process of learning
theatre. A regional centre at Bangalore and a continuing
series of workshops held over the years throughout the
country from Madurai to Jammu, are a measure of its
achievements.
