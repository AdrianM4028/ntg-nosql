The six—year period between 1982 and 1988 NSD saw three directors in
the saddle.

BM. Shah (1 982—84) made several changes in the curriculum that had long
lasting effects such as the re—introduction of courses in specializations of
Acting and Direction.
Shah‘s own directorial interests centred around translations of western
classics into Hindi/ Hindustani.

Mohan Maharishi (19-84-86) revised the syllabus and cotinued the
tradition of inviting guest directors to work with the students, thereby
providing them with oppurtunity to imbibe different traditions in theatre
making .

Vijaya Mehta from Maharashtra was one of the first to introduce the
School to the thought—provoking work of a budding new playwright,
Mahesh Elkunchwar with his play on the restlessness of today's youth in
his outstanding play Holi.

Ratan Thiyam, an eminent NSD alumni took over as Director in 1986
for a year. His tenure saw students’ productions ranging from the
Brec'ntian classic Round Heads and Peaked Heads to the Sanskrit
classic, Shakunz‘a/am and a contemporary take on an older play by G. P.
