The Play

Set in Maharashtra
in the late eighteenth
century, it recounts a
power game played
out in terms of caste
ascendancy in politics.

Best known for his emotionally charged protest plays and film scripts,
Vijay Tendulkar chooses a different genre for Ghas/ram Kotwa/ — that of
a musical historical. Set in Maharashtra in the late eighteenth century,
it recounts a power game played out in terms of caste ascendancy in
politics. The work draws on several Marathi folk styles and has an obvious
relevance in the context of individuals playing the game of politics, taking

advantage of situations, rising to power and crashing to impotence at
the whims of more powerful players. it ends with the death of Ghasiram,
followed by a highly charged speech by Nana, who thus remains the

dramatic centre of the play till the very end.

Revivals are risky. But for a play like Ghas/ram Kotwa/ the risk, though
immense, is worth taking. One should remember that in some plays the
plots are just pegs on which other issues are hung. So is the case with
Ghas/ram Kotvval. The emphasis is on a wholly decadent and pleasure
loving society, the sort of society which can give rise to Ghasiram and
kill him too, but that is, at the same time, willing to tolerate tyranny in
another garb as long as its topsy-turvy values are not disturbed. It is

this that needs to be communicated for the play to be meaningful in a
contemporary context. Although it is a period play, even after so many
years i find it increasingly relevant for our times. And it is for this reason

that I describe it as a ‘Modern Indian Classic’.
