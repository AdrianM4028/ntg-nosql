Translator’s Note

Bapi Bose proposed that I should do the
translation of Nati Binodini for him.
Maithili is my regional language and l
have some working knowledge of spoken
Bengali. Bapi used to read it out to me
in Bengali and I kept writing instantly in
Hindi. Later I made the changes
wherever necessary. Besides the play, l
have translated and composed the verse
and songs also. I am thankful to Director
Bapi Bose.
The main point that drew my attention
was that the two differnt periods
interwoven in the play at the same time.
I had to catch the feel of the
contemporary and company drama by
using old style Hindi. Songs and verses
also needed the same treatment. The
song of the red light area in Calcutta
and the background song of Banaras are
done on these lines. Speech pattern of
Girish Ghosh and Sutradhar is different
from that of Prahalad and Chaitanya.
Translation of even a few crisp and
simple utterances of Thakhur
Paramahansa was a tough task. I have
tried to keep the flavour of the Hindi of
eastern region through out the play,
construction of sentences. That is why
words like ‘Jasti’ or ‘Besi’ are used in the
play. The theme and situations of the
play moved me very deeply while working
on translation. I am grateful to the
author.
