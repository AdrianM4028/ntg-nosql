Directorial

I was born
and was given a piece of land

'What do I do with it?’
I asked
no one spoke

in the silence I grew up
and then asked again
'What do I do with it?’
some laughed

some stared
and one from the end
of long stretch of brown
chequered with pieces of land

a face looked at me
from behind the white skin
of the black eyes

and said
'It is for you tx) make a house'
in the thundering roar of silver birds

across the blue sky
I asked
'What is a house?‘
'It is where you stay

and then mingle with the bones
beneath your piece of land'
it said.
I made a house and I lived in it
sun rose then many times

many were born
and pieces of land came up
each with a house on top
and piles of bones beneath it

all of them asked
'What do we do now?’
it was my turn to answer
and I said
'It is where we live

and then mingle with the bones
beneath i t'
no one asked more
no sounds came

and from the top of my house
I saw everywhere
piles of bones beneath the earth.
