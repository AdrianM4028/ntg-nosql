After the partition of 1947 the generation that was divided into small fragments,
the experience of separation and loss contained a painful longing and a suffocating
bitterness. This bitterness was in the hearts of people standing in lines, on both sides
of the border, with expression of waiting in their eyes, waiting for a new dawn when
their dear friends, relatives, lovers would come near them, without any hindrance,
and embrace them and their tears ofjoy would Ô¨Åll the trench between them.

Karmanwali represents the generation which left India in 1947. A mother left
her 'Watan' and her innocent son is left behind in Hindustan. She undergoes the
exhausting process of devastation and the rehabilitation, but does not forget her son.
This desire to get her child gradually changes into a sore dream and she carries this

fragil bundle of sore dreams in her heart as she wanders here and there, in the hope
that someone might give her the news about her son.
My novel is the story of the search, the journey, and the discovery which
Karmanwali undergoes mentally. Her journey is perhaps more mental, than physical.
This is the story of that journey, that destination, which has no name, because such a
journey and destination cannot be named. This is saga of mute pain of human
relationships which can be experienced but cannot be explained.
