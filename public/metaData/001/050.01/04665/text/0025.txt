Partition of India. A new nation
Pakistan is born.

Sea of human beings move on
unfathomed road. Exodus of people
from one country to another.

in the long shadows of dark alleys,
sunlit lanes exploding in the eyes.
Neighbours stand helpless as the gory

acts of rape, violence and killings are
unleashed.

Karmo share a tent with another
refugee couple Akbar & Noori.
Humiliating encounters with police and
authorities, false assurances by the elite
& eminent citizens of Pakistan, living
on handful of rashan doled out every
evening, becomes a unwritten law. A
law to live and ‘to survive. A long

stretch of barren land dotted with white
spots of refugee tents. Tent no. 512 —
shelter of F‘aiza & Karmo. Shelter of
Akbar and Noori.
One day Karmo spots Karim &
Vakila and Karim tells them about

during their bid to escape to Pakistan

new country starts for them, with a new
address.
