Committed to a revolutionary and radical
aesthetics, Nabarun Bhattacharya (1948 — 20i 4)
was an lndian Bengali writer and the only child of
actor Bijon Bhattacharya and writer l\/lahashweta
Devi. He was raised by his father, an integral part
of lPTA movement, and was initiated into the
Communist fold although his leftisrn went
beyond dry ideology to craft the critique in him,
and combined with emotion to create the artist
who maintained that "the Soviet disintegration
was the biggest tragedy of humanity". His magic
realist writings introduced a strange set of human
beings to Bengali readers, called 'Fyataru' — an

anarchic underclass fond of sabotage and are
capable of ﬂying, who appeared in his books
Mausoleum, Kaangaal Maalshaat, Fatarur

Bombachaak and Fyatarur Kumbhipaak. Aside
from fiction, he also wrote poetry, of which Ei
Mrityu Upotyoka Aaamaar Desh Na (This Valley Of

Death is Not My Country) is an example. In l 993
Shri Bhattacharya was awarded the Sahitya
Akademi Award for his novel, Herbert, that was
later adapted into a film of the same name by
Suman l\/lul<hopadhyay. As translator Arunava
Sinha puts it, he was a man who: ”--subverted

everything that several decades of Bengali
literature had built up. He subverted with his

characters, his stories, and most ofall the audacity
ofideas and language."
