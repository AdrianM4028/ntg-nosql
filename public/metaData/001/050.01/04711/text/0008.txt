DIRECTOR'S NOTE

/ रै

की?

Raaste is a play about personal and political
relationships. As far as direction of any play is
concerned, the director is either an image of
politeness or pride. Rather than expressing his
interpretation through the production, he tries

to define it through words and the result is a
disaster. Critics and spectators debate the
director's work and the playwright is relegated
to the back ground. That's why, in the very
begining I say that " the play is the thing" in
which we try to show the reﬂection of our
present. The playwright after having written
the play becomes normal, limited prejudiced

human-being. His creativity is always superior
to the intellect. The director studies the play
and in the process starts living with it. The
production which emerges on the stage is the
play which has suffered tumultous journey to
incorporate the insights of the director and
perhaps is a metamorphosed version. If the
play is a success, credit should go to the
playwright and then to the actors and
production team. I am ready as a director to
take third position happily. But if it's a failure,
I won't share it with anyone, that's completely
mine.
