ठनी Century AD‘ In add
have that is Devi Chandragupta.
_

‘Mudrarakshasam’ deals with the political upsurge that followed after the end of the

Nanda Dynasty some times towards the end of ﬁrst quarter of the 4th century B.C. when:
Chanakya {Vishnu gupta) succeeded in ending the tyrranical rule of Emperor Nanda and .
subsequently laying the foundation of the benevolent Maurya rule in Magadh. … But his ३

antagonists, Rakshasa being the chief among them, were active in planning to remove i the १
new ruler from Pataliputra, the capital of Magadh and to place Malayaketu, son of the
late Parwateshwara (or Puru), according to the previous agreement.

The diplomatic game .

played on one side by Vishnugupta (Chanakya) and on the other by Rakshasa makes the .
plot of play.

Chandragupta acts as the playboy of the former and Malayaketu of the.
latter. The last scene highlights the human values, and the purpose of the great dramatist
I
is achieved gloriously.

To bring the Indian classics close to the audience of Hindi plays is one of the main
objectives before the dramatic institution ‘Magadh Artists’. For this, abridging and adapting .
the ancient dramas and making them palatable to general mass has been underataken by the .
organisation.

Chaturbhuj, a renowned playwright, actor and Director of many Hindi
historical plays has taken up the gauntlet. The present adaptation is second in rhe series.

He has suCCCSSfUIly adapted and staged ‘Abhigyana Shakuntalam’ the magnum opus of
Mahakavi Kalidas.

In adapting Mudra Rakshasarn the scenes, dialogues and number of characters have

been cut short with neccessary additions, alterations and editing. Keeping in View the
compactness of the adaption, it is needless to say thet the work seems to be an independent

creation of the playwight.

Yet the soul is the same, only the bodyghas changed.
