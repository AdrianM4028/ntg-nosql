To work in full length ‘Ila’ made me aware of how to work in team playing t é
character of “Shradha” was a challenging task. Potraying the character with originality
… was something that helped me to exploit my emotions i.e. that of love, concern and
ultimately that of anger, an amazing experience in all.

The play is a challenging one and the role is even more demanding. It is
experience work cherishing and has helped me explore myself better. I wish the
input flowers up good result.

It’s a was really a hard nut to crack to get into the character. Initially it seemed
really difﬁcult to me to brings such authority and deep sense in my dialogues. I tried

my best and hope for a positive and warm response.

The role “Sumati” that I am playing is of a woman who is very much like today’s

woman I will try to put my best in the role and l have full faith in our hardwork and
hope we will end up being successful.
