लगा वाकई जो रहे है नाटक को , थिएटर को और स्वयं को । बतौर रंगकर्मी मुझे मिला मौका ,
ऐसे स्थानों के साथ काम करने का जो शायद हमसे ज्यादा मेहनती, समझदार और ....... .. जिंदा ।

जैल त्तपतषाती दोपहर में बारिश को कुछ बूंदें।
I will miss this ....... ..
ISHWAR (VASHISHT)

This is my first experience of full ength production. Its no doubt a golden
opportunity for me. I have learn to lot of things during practices. My character isthat
of a शिष्य and वाचक (is one who narrates this story). There are lots of shades in
the character.

EMMY (VlDYA DHAR)
Despite of a short role, I have enjoyed and learnt a lot from the co-workers and
play itself. । have definitely cherished the team work. The play is portraying a historic
event of sex conversion and has drawn a very fine line with its dialogues.

RICHA (CHANDRIKA)
To act in Ha was a whole new world of acting which opened to us for the first
time. I met a lot of new people and made a lots of new friends. People to remember
and memories to cherish. As someone has said ‘It was a life within the life time’.

BARNANA (CHANDRIKA)
l have worked earlier in this play in the direction of Shri Surendra Sharma and
again. I got the opportunity to work with him in the same play. I am playing a small
but interesting character. The whole team is very hardworking and sincere. । hope
we do a good job.
