nutrients in the country.

How big is FCI 2
FCl's five functioning units at Sindri, Nangal, Trombay, Gorakhpur and Narnrup
have the installed capacity of half a million tonnes of plant nutrients. This will rise

commissioning stage. It has also developed and produced a complete range of
fertilizer catalysts.

With a vast network of sales outlets and promotional activities, FC I now serves
