D I R E CTO R ' S NOTE

I dedicate this production of TUGHLAQ to my long time friend and
collaborator,

Raju Bhargava, whose

birthday

coincides

with

its

opening night and to a very special person, Arnita Kagal who warned
me â€œDont do Tugh/aq, Kuckar, surely it will flop."
My

colleague Feisal Alkazi has been extremely helpful to me in

producing TUGHLAQ. I feel I should list him as a co-director and
in many way he is.
