THE PLAYWRIGHT
Priestley, J(ohn) B(oynton) (1894—1984), British writer, born in Bradford. He served in

the infantry during World War 1, after which he attended the University of Cambridge. A newspaper
essayist and critic. he wrote on a variety of subjects and often revealed his opposition to materialism
and mechanization in society. The publication of The Good Companions (1929) a picaresque
novel about a group of traveling performers, and Angel Pavement (1930) a somber and realistic
depiction of the lives of a group of office workers in London, established him as a successful
popular novelist. Whereas his novels were traditional in form, his plays, beginning with Dangerous
Corner (1932), were experimental, particularly in their treatment of time and of past and future
events. Priestley’s major plays include When We Are Married (1938), An Inspector Calls (1946)
and Dragon’s Month (1952) on the latter, he collaborated with his wife, the English archaeologist
and writer Jacquetta Hawkes. Later books include the autobiographical Margin Released (1962),
Man and Time (1964), Essays of Two Decades (1968), The Edwardians (1970), and The English

(1973) Priestley was director of the influential journal New Statesman and Nation and after
declining a knighthood and a peerage, accepted the Order of Merit from Elizabeth 11 in 1977.

SYNOPSIS OF THE PLAY
'An Inspector Calls' is a play by J.B. Priestley in which an engagement party in a well
to do family is disturbed by the visit of a detective inspector inquiring into the death of Eva
Smith, a factory worker. The family members bristle with annoyance at the suggestion that they
might have had something to do with the poor girl’s suicide. The inspector strips down the
family’s pretensions by piecing together and exposing the secrets they have lived with for years.
