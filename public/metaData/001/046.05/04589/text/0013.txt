1930s and early 40s that the .period was known as the swing era. One major development in the
emergence of the swing era was a rhythmic change that smoothed the two-beat rhythms of the
New Orleans style into a more ﬂowing four beats to the bar. Musicians also developed the use
of short melodic patterns, called riffs, in call—and-response patterns. To facilitate this procedure,
orchestras were divided into instrumental sections, each with its own riffs, and opportunities
were provided for musicians to play extended solos.
During World War II, however, the wartime economy and changes in audience tastes had
driven many big bands out of business. Their decline, combined with the radically new bebop
style, amounted to a revolution in the jazz world.
The emotional range expanded to include more unpleasant feelings than before. The most
inﬂuential of the mid—century experiments with classically inﬂuenced jazz were the 1949- 1950
recording made by an unusual nonet led by Charlie Parker’s protégé, a young trumpeter named
Miles Davis. The written arrangements, by Davis and others, were soft in tone but highly
complex. Many groups adopted this “cool” style, especially on the West Coast, and so it became
known as West Coast Jazz.

In the decades that jazz was achieving some artistic recognition with white audiences in
the US it was being associated with the depraved section of the society. After all Harlem was
not a place for high culture. And the jazz connection with the night clubs of New York would
make the music even more closely linked to crime, drugs and prostitution. Hollywood crime
thrillers used jazz music to perpetuate this link. Perhaps the most remembered association of jazz
and theater came from Kunt Weill’s score for Brecht’s Threepenny opera. The echoes of “Macthe-knife” can be heard in contemporary mystery and crime thrillers, as indeed in this production.
