About the play
Candida is a comedy by playwright George Bernard Shaw. It was ﬁrst published in
1898, as part of his Plays Pleasant. The play questions Victorian notions of love and
marriage, asking what a woman really wants her husband to provide her with.
Additionally, because the clergyman is a Fabian Socialist, as was Shaw, various
political issues of the time are also in the plot.
The play is set in the northeast suburbs of London in October, and tells the story of
Candida, the wife of a ﬁrst-rate clergyman named James Mavor Morell. Morell is a
popular Christian Socialist Reverend in the Church of England, however, Candida is
responsible for most of his success. When he married Candida, she brought along
Eugene Marchbanks, a young poet, who wants to rescue her from what he presumes
to be a dull family life. Marchbanks is in love with Candida, and believes she
deserves something more than just complacency from her husband. Both men love
her for different reasons, and she is attracted to them both for the different lifestyles
they provide. Morell, sensing he is ﬁghting a losing battle, demands Marchbanks to
leave at once, yet Candida undercuts her husband and instead invites him to stay at

the house. Leaving the two alone together Reverend Morell observes Candida and the
poet growing closer to one another. The men ﬁght over her, and in the end, Candida
chooses the man who needs her the most, her husband, and not where her heart is,

Marchbanks. The poet leaves with a secret, which neither Morell nor Candida
understand.
