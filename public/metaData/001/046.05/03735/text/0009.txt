DIRECTOR'SIE
In popular tradition, this may well be seen as the saga or ‘qissa’ of the ‘baghi’ and ‘tawaif’ a bond
sustained in marginalized wilderness oftime.
Azizun, much cherished in the living memory of Kanpur is the pivot around which many other lives
and references are woven.
Shamsudin Sawar ofthe 42nd Cavalry, Sarvar, allegedly involved in the Bibighar massacre, Adila and
Hussaini, members of Nana Saheb's household, Mohammad Ali a strategist, Greene, a musician in
the army all move in and out of her house. The passing away ofthe tawaif tradition is closely linked
to the controversial events of l 857 that raise questions more difﬁcult than the task of reconstructing
events. And yet there are moments that transcend time — the desire to overcome limitations within,
and to connect with the times and world around. Yet the space that a woman seeks to claim could
leave her an outsider, and not without vulnerability. Above all, whose concerns does she or can she
carry with her while trying to prove capable of a space that she wishes to have? Where does or can
she position herselfon matters ofviolence and race? In the process what happens to her relationship
with Zubaida, the conscience and Roshni, the young talent who could have been Azizun, the
courtesan?
The present production has been conceived and created in collaboration with the student actors who
are central to the nature of the performance that accommodates their pace, perception, quality and
nature of expression. To empathize with characters who at one level seem so distant is not an easy
task and yet the complexity of the historical moment (that forms the background) makes it a
compelling one. However the versatility ofhistory makes one wonder-ifthis be all?

I am extremely indebted to the production team, the workshop, light and costume department ofthe;
school for the care with which they have contributed to the production.
