The play, "Azizun" is based on the actual events in Cawnpore
(Kanpur) during the sepoy revolt of 1857. The characters are those
who were actually present and participated in that revolt barring few

kotha who form a circle of camaraderie and friendship with each
other.

mother is a courtesan in Lucknow. Azizun is in love with

peace as against war of, Azizun. Though they are friends they
differ in this respect. Perhaps they are the ﬁrst common women's

voices ofliberal and radical camps in politics.
