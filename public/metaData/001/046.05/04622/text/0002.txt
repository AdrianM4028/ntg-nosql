About the play

It has been an interesting experience working on Bhagwat Gita and evolving a
performance text from it. IhereIS an ongoing debate on whether the Mahabharata
war happened or not. During the scripting and reading I also realised that rather than
a physical war it is more a metaphor of war. Kurukshetra is transformed into the
‘human breast where the conﬂict between the good and evil perpetually goes on.
Ihe playIS a try to catch some thirds1n this direction.
