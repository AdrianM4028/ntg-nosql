DIRECTOR'S NOTE
The play is an eerie study in abnormal psychology. It is quite interesting
that in an attempt to bring back Bhima from his illusionary world, Dr.
Prema herself enters into the illusionary world of being Bhima's
Draupadi !

The Art and Science, Illusion and Reality, being Natural and Stylized are
so nicely interlinked that it becomes very difÔ¨Åcult to analyze them
separately.

The dramatist has made use of strikingly unconventional devices like a
dance play (Kathakali) within the play. As the hero of the story is a
Kathakali dancer, the traditional dance play is worked into this modern
Freudian situation in such a way that one cannot be extricated from the
other, and each achieves an additional dimension and a new meaning in
the artistic process.

Kathakali is a kind ofpan tom im e dance, classical in nature, where silent,
masked actors dance out the legends and stories of the epics through a
vast vocabulary of eye movements, hand gestures, rhythmic steps,
accompanied by drums and songs.
