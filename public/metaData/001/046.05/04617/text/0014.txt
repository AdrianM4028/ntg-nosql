Time and the Conways
Time and the Conways (1937). The play begins on an
autumn night in 1919, the twenty-first birthday of
Kiran, second—eldest daughter of the Conways, which
the other six members of the family and some close
friends celebrate in joyous, youthful high spirits. Kiran
an aspiring novelist, watches her little world acting and
reacting in a game of charades and then lapses into a
private reverie. Act II shifts to the same room twenty
years later, dramatizing Kiran's vision in a chilling
atmosphere of unfulﬁlled dreams and Vicious quarreling,
the same characters all having failed in life and love.
Kiran is consoled by her gentle brother Arun, who points
out, with William Blake, that "Man was made forjoy and
woe." Act III reverts to the birthday party, with Mrs.
Conway prophes ring a warm and cosy future for her
children and all save Kiran unaware of coming
disasters.
