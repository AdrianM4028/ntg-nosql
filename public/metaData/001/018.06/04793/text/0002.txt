About the play
Girish Karnad’s plays take their cue from the
past in order to observe the present. Naga
Mandala is a story that is fluid enough to
disturb stable representations. In it he weaves
together two Kannada folk stories, the first
about the contradictory nature of oral tales
and their relationship with the storyteller.
The second is the story of an unhappy bride,
who fills her loneliness by conjuring fantasies,
dreams and illusions to give meaning to her
life.
The story about a snake becoming her lover,
after drinking the magic potion, can be
perceived on many levels. There is the literal
narrative - a snake assuming the role of her
husband. And on a completely different
register the transformation of the husband
into the snake assumes a philosophical tenor.
Does the Naga lover really exist or is he a
figment of her imagination. Or is it the
husband playing a game of his own? Or is it the
wife who creates her story? Is this a play about
two separate people, or one? A persons
dialogue, between the self and the imagined
self?
The character of the husband is split into two.
In his human form, he is a coarse man who
brutalises his wife Rani during the day, but at
night he metamorphosis’s into a divine lover a Naga-Raja. Both halves are unaware of each
other, both exist in one another, both are each
others divided self’s, contradicting and
contrasting with each other, in a dynamic play
of fantasy and illusion. The blind woman, and
her son, create a counter narrative, physical
blindness serving as a leitmotif, to the
spiritual blindness of the husband .

Karnad explores the meaning of creativity by
presenting a complex and provocatively
ambiguous world where fictional characters
and real characters intermingle and the lines
between the visible and the invisible are
blurred. What makes his work fascinating is
that even though it is set in the traditional/fol k
format, it examines
contemporary.

the characters take flight,

inhabiting a fluid and magical world, where
anything can happen. Flames can speak, a
story can manifest itself as a character, a
snake can assume a human form, and a
woman writes her own story by the power of
her imagination.
