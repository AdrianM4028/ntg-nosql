ABOUT TH E__P_LAY :
When one is denied the respect due to a man only for the reason that he is borne by ’lowcaste’ parents, the offence can not simply be termed as a social violence. It assumes the

proportion of a crime against human kind. Yet by the turn in situation murderer becomes a
winner whereas the victim is unforgiven. The culprit may receive the severe punishment at
the hands of the law but, in fact, it is the society which is put in the dock.
The Court Martial, written by Swadesh Deepak, is the story of a recruit Ram Chander
who is tried for murdering one of his officers and injuring another. The Court Martial is
presided by a war-veteran Col Surat Singh who has been a witness to many ‘life-andoeath’
situations. But this trial puts him in a queer position so far unknown to him and during the
course of interrogation he realises that the issues at stake are much larger tht meets the
eye. Realising that the Indian Army is the only government agency in which reservation on
caste basis is not permissible, the Court Martial presents a combination of legal and poetic
justioe.
