TUG HLA Q
About the Pla

Tughlaq written originally in Kannada by eminent Playwright
Director and Actor Dr. Girish Karnad in 60's has been a challenge to
enact on stage for many a theatre persons right since its origination.

It has been translated in different languages and so far been now it has
been variously handled and interpreted by likes of Omshivpuri,
Ibrahim Alkazi, Shyarnanand Jalan, Satya Dev Dubey, Prasanna and
Dinesh Thakur among a few other stalwarts of theatre. Among others
Ibrahim Alkazi more notably gave Tughlaq a very grand historical scale,
full of glitter of old traditions and customs by staging it for the first
time in the premises of Delhi's Old Fort for NSD repertory.
Our idea is to break this myth. For what we visualise about the
various Character and situations within the play is their
contemporariness. which otherwise has been put up by the dramatist
in a historical back drop, may be as an entertainment value or for

drawing comparisons between the socio-economic and political
condition of a period as old as 800 years and of our modern times or
for both. Our emphasis is on highlighting this contemporary touch in
the play. The plot highlights the clash between power, politics and
religion in which neither side gains but a third party has been left with
an opportunity to exploit the situation. This party represents a true

picture of our opportunist modern times. This play is a saga of a man
who ultimately got confused with his own vision of life while fighting
various deterrents. lossing his sensitivity, high morals and humanity.
This play choosing incidents from Mohammad-Bin-Tughlaq's life.
sketches a drama full of human sentiments, clash of human values,
social relation and politics.

Tughlaq is an important play of celebrity Dr. Girish Karnad who
works like Yayati. Haivadan, Antumallige, Taledand and
given
has
Nagmandal.
