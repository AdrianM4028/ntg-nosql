‘Chorus’ explains the circumstances in which Dilip Singh, the minor son

of Maharaja RanjitSingh, from her last wife Rani Jindan,

accedes to

the throne of Punjab.
SCENE 1.

Lahore Fort : Rani Jindan’s Chamber

Rani Jindan holds the Court with two of her loyal ministers~Diwan Dina

Nath and Hakim Nuruddin, who advise her to exercise caution in dealing
with Sir Henry Lawrence, the British Resident in Lahore. Rani Jindan
stung by curtailment of her political and financial powers, dismisses them

unceremoniously and calls for her trusted spy, Baba, a disguised old mandisciple of famous revolutionary Sant Maharaj Singh. She is advised

by Baba to establish contact secretly with the Khalsa army.

Rani refuses

to see reason as she holds the army in contempt because of her brother's
assasi nation.

SCENE 2.

Lahore Fort : Darbar Hall

Child Dilip Singh refuses to put ’tilak' on the forehead of Raja Tej Singh.
SCENE 3. : Lahore : Official residence of the Resident.

Sir Henry Lawrence, the Resident, discusses the incidence of the previous day in Darbar with Sir Fredric Curry. Lawrence knowing that Rani
is still popular amongst the people, pleades for a careful and cautious
policy, while Frederic Curry is in favour of taking some strong action
against Rani. TejSingh, now the Raja and Prime Minister of Punjab,
calls on the resident and advises him to imprison Rani Jindan and
liquidate the Khalsa Army.

Disagreement between Lawrence and Curry comes to a peak when Lawrence realizes that Curry's policy is being blessed from the top. He leaves

the meeting in a huff. Curry decides to banish Jindan from Lohore and
recalls Raja Sher Singh from Multan front where Mool Raj has revolted
against the British authority. He tells Sher Singh that this is an internal
problem of Punjab and the British forces will not fight along with Sikhs.
