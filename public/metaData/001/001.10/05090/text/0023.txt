The Seagull Complex houses The Seagull Theatre Academy, The Seagull Open-Air TheaTre
and The Seagull Studio Theatre. Seagull, since its inception, has been committed To
staging qualitative play—productions for The Theatre enthusiasts of Assam. However in The
course of our experience, we have sometimes faced space and infrastructural
constraints. As a humble initiative To address This lacuna, The Seagull Studio Theatre is

being inaugurated on April l0,2005. WiTh a seating capacity of l 50, a Green Room, lighT
and sound equipments, This auditorium has been constructed To make Theatre
performance and viewing a comfortable and enjoyable experience. This facility will also
be available to other theatre Troupes at a nominal cost. The concept of Weekend
Theatre, which has so far not gained ground in The Northeast, will be introduced by The
Seagull Repertory Company at The Studio Theatre.
The Seagull Open-Air Theatre was conceived with The idea of providing a novel
TheaTre—viewing experience and as a platform for different Troupes To showcase Their
Talent To audiences. WiTh a number of plays like Ganashatru, Rakfakarabi, Merchant of

Venice etc. having been staged, The Open—air Theatre has Today become very popular.
