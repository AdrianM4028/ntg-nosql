Assam— a land which nature has endowed wiTh abundance; it is The land
where people
from myriad races and Tribes cohabiT harmoniously: iT is The land where a rich and
composite
culture has evolved since Time irnrnernorial. The liberal ethos of Assamese culture
has
encouraged The flowering of diverse arT forms. WheTher iT is Bihu, Puppetry, Ojapali
or
Ankiyanaat... Assam boasts of an exuberant heritage of performing arTs.
TheaTre has been an integral parT of Assam‘s social and cultural milieu. ln Assam, Theatre
Thrives owing To The commitment of a number of gifted artistes and The earnesT involvement
of innumerable Theatre—enthusiasts. In The T9905, a few young and dedicated Theatre
acTivisTs including some graduates from The National School of Drama saw a dream...To
enrich The panorama of Assamese TheaTre by experimentation, Training and consistent
practice; To provide a prolific exposure of Assamese Theatre To a national and international
audience and To bring The richness of Indian and world classic plays To local Theatre viewers
Through regular performances. As a stepping-stone To make This dream a reality ‘Seagull’
was established on T 0th December T990 aT Guwahati. Seagull is registered under The Societies
Registration AcT, XXI of l860.
Initially Seagull’s focus was exclusively on performances, but gradually There was a need
To diversify its acTiviTies. As a response To This requirement and in The greater inTeresT of
Assamese Theatre, it was felt ThaT There should be an increase in its repertoire. Consequently,
The' numbers of acTiviTy wings were increased. In l995,under The aegis of The National
School of Drama’s Extension Programme, The Seagull Theatre Academy was founded for
imparting Training under a one-year course in drarnatics. Seagull's own Publication Wing
was also established in The year T995. With The aim of introducing qualitative play productions
To The local viewers, Seagull has been organizing The National Theatre Festival since T997.
Seagull has noT only been performing at various places in The Northeast but has also been
conducting Theatre—workshops in association with local TheaTre-Troupes. Theatre Training
and performances for The children at Shishu Sarafhi, a school for SpasTic Children have
been organized regularly for The past few years.
