Seagull Theatre Academy
ln conformity with Seagull's holistic and professional approach to theatre,
training for actors

has been considered to be an indispensable requirement. Only a trained actor
can have
an in depth understanding and appreciation of the varied aspects of theatre.
Consequently
under the able guidance of Bhagirathi, the Seagull Theatre Academy was establish
ed in
1995 as a part of the National School of Drama ’5 Extension Programme. A full—fled
ged course
was conducted till 1999, whereby an average of twenty students were
imported
comprehensive training in drarnatics every year. Thereafter with the closure of NSD's project,

Seagull has been conducting the training programme on its own initiative.
Bhagirathi and Baharul Islam conduct the regular classes for the course. Moreover
to
encourage the students and enrich their learning-experience, a number of eminent
personalities like Late B.V. Karanth, H.Kanhailal, Rita G. Kothari, Satyabrata Rawat, Ashish
Vidyarthi, Siddhartha Chakravarty, Ramachandra Sahu, Jyoti Narayan Nath, Karuna Deka
etc. have visited the Academy as Guest-lecturers.
More than a hundred students, hailing from different corners of the state, have passed out
from the Academy so for. Some of them have started their own theatre-troupes in their
hometowns, some have gone for further training to National School of Drama, and some
have become actively involved in commercial theatre or the media.
