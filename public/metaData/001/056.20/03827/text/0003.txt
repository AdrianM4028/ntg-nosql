ABOUT “MAHA BRAHMAN”
Maha Brahman (Original Marathi play "Kirwant") Siddheshwar, who performs the funeral
rites and therefore is not allowed to attend any of the auspicious functions take place. No
doubt everybody rushes to him when a death occurs but otherwise no one even drinks water
at his house
Siddheshwar and his family members Rewati (wife), Madhu (son) and Vasudev (brother)
have no social life, being forbidden to attend the functions.

Digambarshastri, a prominent religious authority insults Siddheshwar during 'Pooja' and
drives him away. Vasudev abuses Digambarshastri openly and does not allow his brother to
perform the death rites of Vedantshastri's (second religious authority) mother. In this situation Digarnbarshastri calls another 'Maha Brahman’ from a neighbouring village and
Siddheshwar and his family is declared an outcast. Vasudev, the brother of Siddheshwar

rebels against the religious authorites but fails. One Of his friends Keshav Abhyankar with
whom he works for 'Hindu Ekata Sangh' also denies to help him

to forgive him. But Digarnbarshastri told him to kill his brother Vasudev and to teach his son
Madhu a job of 'Maha Brahman'. Disappointed and frustrated he becomes mad and dies.
Despite the oppositions from Vasudev, Rewati who always wanted to keep her son Madhu,
away from the profession of last rites, ﬁnally makes him a 'Maha Brahman'.

'Maha Brahman' is the researched play based on a stark reality of our social set-up. ln coastal
Maharashtra some Brahrnin clause have traditionally been performing last rites and other
rituals associated with death. These Brahmins are known as 'Kirwant'. In Bihar region these
Brahmins are called 'Mahapatra' and somewhere they are called 'Maha Brahman’.
It is an irony that Marathi literature with over seven hundred years tradition had not noticed
this.
