HOW MAHA BRAHMAN WAS BORN
"A young boy of about 18 or so was doing a one-act play of mine for a competition. At one
point, 1 noticed that the pace of rehearsals had slackened. 1 asked him why. He said he was
strapped for time. Again, I asked him why. He said he had to work all hours in the crematorium. That intrigued me. The Crematorium? 1 asked. What for“? He told me he was too tired to
talk just then, but if 1 went over to his place in a couple of days, he would tell me.

1 went to his place two days later, accompanied by a friend. 1 told the boy that 1 was there
for the information he had promised me. । was very curious to know what kind of work he
did in the crernatorium. He looked utterly blank. Work in crematorium’? Me? Why should 1
work in a crematorium’? he said. 1 was stumped. Here was a man who had himself told me
only two days ago about this work that he did, and now he was ﬂatly denying it. He
continued to deny having anything to do with the crematorium and there was nothing I could
do but accept his answer. But the whole thing had made me really curious.
My enquires led me to the Malad crernatorium, where a man called Ashok Joshi was the
officiating priest. He kept asking me why should 1 want to know about crernatoriurn work
and 1 kept saying it was just an academic interest, because my curiosity had been aroused by
this young man's sudden denial of the work he did. Joshi gave me some information, He told
me that the sect ofBrahmins who traditionally conducted ﬁaneral rites were called Keerwantas
in the Konkan region from where they all hailed. The name was a corruption of Kriyanwant—
the one who conducts the kriyas or last rites. He described some of these rites to me. Then
he told me that he had been thrown out ofthe local Brahmin Sabha because he did cremation
work. So these Brahrnin were on par in a way with the Devdasisl'
And thus the "Maha Brahman" was born.
