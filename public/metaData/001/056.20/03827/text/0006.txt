DIRECTORS NOTE
A few core points inspired me to do this
play as I was in search for deeper deﬁnation
of character and to portray the. development
of characters, situations and events.

As the style of my working is very ﬂexible
and visual oriented I wanted to use the limbs
oflndian paintings such as the artistic manner of using colours, knowledge ofappearance, correct perception of measure and
structure and infusion of grace and artistic
expression.

A creative combination of above elements
use of which has vital significance for contemporary Indian stage in search of its identity is necessary to establish unity between
realism & poetry.
Production is an ensemble work in the true
sense of the word. Every body contributed
in every thing and this has been a rewarding
experience for me.
The score is based on classical/light music
which I hope will be enjoyed by one and all.
