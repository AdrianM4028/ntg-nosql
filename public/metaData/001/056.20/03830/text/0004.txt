I had been reﬂecting for a while on what will be the Directorial Note for the play "MUHE AMRITA CHAHIYE". I
was given two plays by the 'Sahitya Kala Parishad' for their festival 'Mohan Rakesh Samman', 2003.
Interestingly, both plays were selected. However, after much contemplation I chose 'Mujhe Amrita Chahiye' and
staged its ﬁrst show in September 26-2४१11१ 2003 in the Sahitya Kala Parishad festival.

For the presentation ofthe play I used the play — in - play mode.
The Story line runs on three levels — Vijaya’s Home, Theatre Group and Rehearsal ofa play by the theatre goup.

My main focus throughout was not to lose the theme ofthe play and regardless ofthe styles we chose, my only effort
is to get the concept ofthe play across the viewers.
However, once again I leave it to the audience to decide for themselves
