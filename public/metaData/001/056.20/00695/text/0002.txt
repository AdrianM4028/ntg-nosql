BEAUMARCHAIS (1 732- 1799) is remembered for two
comedies—The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of
Figaro— mainly because they were made famous
as operas by Rossini and Mozart respectively. He said
himself that he wrote plays for amusement—it was
something he had to do as an essential expression
of his personality. He was also, at various times
or simultaneously, artisan, courtier, musician, financier,
diplomat, merchant and ship-owner, army contractor,
secret agent, publisher and controversialist.
He knew the extremes of success and failure, wealth
and poverty, the freedom of palaces and the
constraint of jails.

History says it was Beaurnarchais who brought fun back
into the theatre, and broke the convention of formality
which had grown up since Moliere. His dialogue
was colloquial and his people real in eighteenth-century
Paris. The humour, liveliness and vigour depend on
an interplay of character which was quite new to
his audiences.
It was in the spirit of Beaumarchais—man of ideas and
action—~that we undertook our adaptation of his play
based on J.N. Kaushal's version. (We thank Mr Kaushal
for allowing us the liberty). Clinging to the barest
framework of the plot, the company evolved its work
through a process of free-wheeling improvisations.

Beneath the fun and frivolity there is a quality which is
not to be confused with indifference. A man who
must laugh at the world lest he should weep is
a figure only the happier ages of history can ignore.
