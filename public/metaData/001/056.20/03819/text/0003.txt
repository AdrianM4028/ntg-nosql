M “Shtaq Kak
Life sacrifices each of us. As human beings we know we are going to die some day with each second of our lives moving closer to that
end point. Although we may avoid thinking about our own death we are often attracted to the performance of violence onstage and on screen, in dramatic fiction
and news, media reports, representing the possibility or actuality of death of others. Through such spectatorship we experience the suffering and death of others
vicariously, so as to explore the potential fear and meaning of our own being towards death.
The realm of human life is directly represented by concrete visual symbols, but the realm of nature is only evolved through suggestions effectively emphasing the
invisible quality of nature and since nature remains invisble, it remains mysterious & awesome, scarely comprehensible from the point of view of the visible &
uncomplicated human realm.
“MYSTIC GULF" between the spectators and the stage, this kind of drama carefully excludes all effects that might violate a naturalistic perspective. It‘s intention is
to present a slice of reality in which the action on the stage seemineg duplicates life itself and therefore it pretends that its audiecne does not exists.
