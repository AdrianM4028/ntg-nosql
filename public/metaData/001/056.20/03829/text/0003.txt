DIRECTORS NOTE
Working with Shri Ram Centre Reperory's artistes was, in
a way, working on basics and getting to know each other,

particularly oneself. So, we defied the traditional formula of a
few readings of the play and then casting and mugging up of
dialogues etc. Instead we all tried to explore and interpret the
text of the play in our own way, in its entirety. This brought to fore
many fresh ideas which were the actor's own ideas and everybody
tried to give one's best - physically, mentally as well as spiritually.

This was achieved through various well-known theatrical
and musical games and the artistes were able to discover
something new about oneself. More importantly we tried to
achieve all this through an atmosphere of fun which paved the
way for mutual acceptability and respect. Hence we were able to
enjoy the process and learn from it, in a spirit of relative
togetherness.

I hope the artistes not only retain the freshness and truth

each one has discovered in this month-long process but also
extend it, in all their future performances, not just of this but
every other play.
Last but not the least, Dario Fo's play Archangels Don't
Play Pinballs as the ideal springboard for all our explorations.

We had fun and now it is your turn!
