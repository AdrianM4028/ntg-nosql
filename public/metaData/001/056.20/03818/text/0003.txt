Callimaco in eonnivanee with a rogue pretends to be a well-known
French doctor who knows how to make a certain potion which is sure to

help the woman conceive. . The only hitch being that the very first person
who will sleep with her after having this potion, is sure to die. Obviously,”
it can't be the husband. Then who? A stranger, perhaps! Moreover, will
his wife agree to such an immoral act of sleeping with a stranger? This is

where Callimaco and that rogue decide to
making the Church priest tell her that there is
Treachery, and corrupt practices on the part
Callimaco and the woman together, not just for

inﬂuence the woman by
nothing immoral about it!

DIRECTOR'S NOTE
A very interesting aspect of the Italian Renaissance drama is that most of
the action in these plays takes place off—stage, or so to say, in the minds
of the audience. And most of the writers uphold the essence of story

telling i.e. suspense. What will happen is as important for them as how
will it happen. The way each character is welcomed by another character
is reminiscent of this golden era in the history of Italian renaissance
drama.

Machiavelli is known as the staunch supporter of a typically western
political philosophy he professed to the core that 'end justifies the means'
which is in sharp contrast to the eastern thought of 'means justify the
end'. However, it is very interesting and surprising to note that through
this play he makes a mockery of this very philosophy by making us all
laugh at the absurdity of it! No wonder, ‘they say every coin has two

sides! lf Surendra Varma's highly acclaimed play Surya Ki Antim
Kiran Se ...... .. is the tragic way of looking at things, La Mandragola is
a farcical treatment of the same plot !
