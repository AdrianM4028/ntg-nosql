Oh I how I loved it all

My mind is full
and so are my eyes I
Let me go singing the Love
for the Tritling.

I am a wayfarer. The path is my companion
It spends the day counting the footsteps
ot the Wide world. At night it sings under
starlight.
On it the Chariot wheels of time
have left their track;

On the dust lie in reposeful sleep
The weary hOpes of ages.
I do not remember when I took to. the path.
As I move, and the path turns,

my journey is ever new. All my hopes are
one with the path, and love is born as I move.
My life is drunk with eestaey of movement.
