CHILDREN’S LITTLE THEATRE
A N D के ITS AIMS

“8"- "

Children are the same the whole world over.
They have their own language expressed in movement. rhythm and jingles. That is why for them
there are no linguistic barriers. It is feeling more
than ideas that they wish to express and their most
natural form of self-expression is through rhythm.

This is the central idea that lies behind the
Children's Little Theatre movement. The sponsors
are not Psychologists.
but they are lovers and
observers of children and they have tried to provide what the children need. Often the direction
has been indicated by the
children themselves.
the (‘LT has only helped to blaze the trail for them.

CLT is not
just a school of dancing or an
organization for producing children’s plays it is
something more. It does not merely want to train
the bright children or those who are adept at
dancing. Its aim
is to produce
material for
Junior School Classes. to enliven them by introducing music. rhythm. rhyme and mime. and to
show schools how they can produce and stage
their own shows. and inculcate in their children
an appreciation of music. colour and drama.
