TAPATI
by
Rabindarnath Tagore
Story and theme

Tapati (1929) is the dramatic perfection of Tagore’s early written play
Raja O Rani (1889) (King and Queen). Typical 'I‘agorian ideas and philosophy
of human life and love, peace and power have been depicted in theme and
characters : Sumitra’s idea of love and peace, for example, is certainly, by all
means and for all the times, truthfully greater than the pomp and power, lust
and pride (for the physical feminine charm) of Vikramdeb, the king of
Jallandhar. He simply by force, in the name of war, took Sumitra, out of her
parental custody and married. Tapati (Sumitra) resented. Prayed to her God
in the Martanda temple in Kashmir : decided to sacriﬁce her life. But the old
good citizens requested her not to die but to win Vikramdeb by her power of
love and peace.
Vikram went on oppressing the poor subjects mercilessly and roared with the:
vanity of wealth and might to win the love and aﬁection from Sumitra : but all
in vain. He became irresistible ; almost mad with anger : deeided to impresion

her. Tapati did not care : lef't Jallandhar for Kashmir to take her religious
refuze and justice from her God. Debdatta, Naresh and her boom-companion.
Bipasa joined her side. But Vikramdeb ran after : his torture knew no limit
and ethics. All wanted to close all the gates to save the sanctity of the temple
and the life of Sumitra also. Bht she asked all to keep open all the doors of all
the sides so that Vikramdeb might come at once to the place of truth, love and.
peace :

so that he could realize the truth of life.

And now, by this time, she

got herself ready for the self'-immolation and began to chant the peace mantras.
of the Vedas :
Let the earth bring peace !

Let the sky bring peace !
Let the Heaven bring peace !
Peace !

Peace !

Peace !
