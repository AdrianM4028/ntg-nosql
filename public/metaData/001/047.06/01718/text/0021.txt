CO LONISATION

It was all perfectly legal.
Whenever they needed a law, they made one.
The Crown looked after the planters
And after itself.
Ordinance 12 of 1840:
Allforest, waste, unoccupied or uncultivated land
Presumed to be the property of the Crown.
If the man who lived there couldn’t prove he lived there,
He had to get out. That was going too far
And the London government annulled it.
But ship by ship, on every ship
Britishers ﬂocked to the coffee EL Dorado.
They needed a law and they made one.
Uninterrupted possession for thirty years,

Or even five, had guaranteed to the people
The right to go on tilling the land of their fathers
(Amendment to Ordinance 12).

That was going too far
“Why have we British come here a ny way?”
Ordinance 9 of 1841:
The newly guaranteed rights
Were not to apply in the former Kandyan Kingdom.
“Do you live here? Well, prove it!”
The temples and chiefs could prove it
With their copper title-deeds.
The people’s deeds were on palm leaves.
The palm leaves had been dust for centuries.
So the British grabbed the pastures,

Grabbed the poorfields burnt out ofjungle.
The Kandyans tore up the coffee trees,
They smashed the boundary fences.
Just one more law was needed'
Ordinance 6 of 1846,
A year in prison and fifty lashes
If you cut, broke, barked or uprooted
The golden coffee trees, and a month for fences.
