Synopsis
'Zille Subhani' is a historical play based on the period of 14th century from the death of Alla—ud-din Khilji to the
coronation of Mohd. Tughlaq.
A Play which reveals the vulgar and malicious reality of the corrupt politicians, elites and the merchant class. It has
in it a chain of unstability of rulers, carelessness towards there responsibility and selﬁshness.
Play begins with Malik Kafur a Eunuch in power who has killed the ex-ruler Alla—ud-din Khilji and prisoned his son
Mubark and now is ready to marry his widow. But the son 'Mubarak Shah' through his trickry and cleverness kills the
Eunuch and seizes the authority. Mubarak has been potrayed as a completely spoilt, careless and luxurious ruler.
'Hassan' is one of the subjects of Mubarak and is also a victim of his lust & attraction. He bears everything quietly as
he is helpless and is entirely enmeshed by the circumstances. Hassan’s brother Hissamuddin also endures the same
pain. Gradually Hassan also developes interest for the coronet and power. He then slowly starts ensnaring Mubarak
and at last overpowers him completely. One day he kills him and himself becomes the ruler. He even marries the
widow of Mubarak as a result of his revenge.
'Gazi Malik' a loyal ofﬁcer of late Mubarak Shah and Khilji dynasty attacks and captures the power. He releases
murder order for Hassan and Hissamuddin and at last wears the crown.
Though the play ends here but it conveys that this game of rulers will go on as an neverending cycle. In this game of
politics the most important role has been played by the elite class or the rich who carelessly and shamelessly sees
everything but don't speak just to retain there power and gain beneﬁts. It is entirely because of the cowardice of these
people that such corrupt and spoilt leaders rule and exploits the subjects.
