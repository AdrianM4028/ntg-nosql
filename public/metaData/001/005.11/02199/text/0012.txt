My dear Shri Sing/2,
I am writing this persnal communication
in order to express my appreciation whle
I
conveyed orally when you

met me the other day, about the successful staging

qfthe drama
’Chor Ke Ghar Mor. By staging this drama, the
Reserve Bank Ayam JVatya Sand/la
has
addedyet anotherfeather to its already
resplendent 5013-14 large P075 0f the
“we”
was due to thefine diction of the dialogues,

far more important was, however, the very
effective and impressive delivery of the dialogues
and the Director‘s contribution which

are always very essential in dramas
particularly
participation brought about by the actors in a dram because of til" “Hamil? audience
a unlihe the shadows कृ" the cinema
screen. Verily, drama is a barometer of the intel
lectual and cultural activity of the society
of which we are part much the same way
as music and literature ' are. Your
society has

dramatic
really elevated the Reserve Ban/cfamily thro
ugh the staging of this drama,
with its very deep social and moral cont
ent. The

theme song rendered in a feeling
manner was also an excellent innovati
on. I am sure that the Ayam Natya
Sanstha will
stage more dramas and movefrom
succes to success. Please convey my
appreciation to
all

the participants in the venture.

With warm regards,
your sincerely
