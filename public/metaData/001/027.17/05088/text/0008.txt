Actually it's a way of life. Commitment. Tenacity of purpose. For nothing but the
very best will do. A philosophy we at Subros have inherited from Denso Corpn.
of Japan. Our technical collaborators. The world leaders in car air-conditioners.
No wonder, Maruti reposed their faith in us. To provide original fitment for all
company air-conditioned cars. Much the same as Suzukis back home in Japan
are also fitted with air—conditioners from Denso Corpn. With 6,00,000 Subros
fitted cars, including Maruti 800. 1000. Esteem, Zen & Gypsy and ’I‘ata Sierra.
Estate, Sumo & Safari, braving the summer heat on Indian roads, we feel our
beads of perspiration are well worth the effort to keep you cool.
