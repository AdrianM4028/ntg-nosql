every dawning sun brings a ﬂood at

interads a ﬂood of ideas—advertising idea
s.
which aren’t ‘fish—hook-catches' of an
unrestricted sail of imagination—but
created with pains—a lot of brain—
teasing—by a creative cell—who
knows its job.

ideas—of course are clothed with

imagination—with pictures—and
words and unleashed;

-—to drive the message home.
—in the market of each individual client
—with conviction.
