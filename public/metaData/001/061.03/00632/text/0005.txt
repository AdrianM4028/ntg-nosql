Keibul—Lamjao, the ﬂoating Sanctuary around
the Loktak Lake of Manipur is the home of
Sangai, brow-antlered-deer which is known as
the ‘animal the looks at you’. At one time the
Sangai p0pulation was numerous, and covered
the entire hills and valleys of Manipur. In
course of time however, the population of the
brow-antlered-deer reduced, and is now facing

a serious danger of extinction. They have many
enemies. And the greatest of these enemies
is man, even to this day.
