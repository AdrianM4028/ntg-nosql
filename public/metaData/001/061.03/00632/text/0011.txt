Bhaskaracharya’s Lilavati (10th c) is an important text in Indian Mathematics. It is in the

form of simple questions from a father to
a daughter.
The interpretative elements in our dance
production are not the actual numbers but elements of nature—water; lotus lakes, ﬂowers,

bees, swans, clouds—highlighting a finely tuned
sensitivity to environment and to the realm
of human tenderness evoked by numbers being
given an imaginative and visual form.
