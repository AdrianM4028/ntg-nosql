Sat. 25th. Nov. ’89
In Mahadev, dance is seen through dancers’
eyes. A guru along with his disciples is staging
a dance-drama based on the myth of Shiva and
Sati. The mythological events—Sati’s penance
to win the hand of Shiva, the marriage of Shiva
and Sati, Sati’s father Daksha’s cursing of Shiva
at the Prayag Yagna and finally Daksha’s own
yagna to which Shiva and Sati are not called
and which Sati attends and unable to bear the
insult done to her husband, enters the sacrificial ﬁre and is immolated—are treated insuch a
way that they are sometimes catalyst and at
other times caused by parallel and diverging
events in the lives of the dancers.
In the first half of the ballet, the dancers and

their relationships with one another take precedence, but by the second half their own very
real and often violent emotions have become

so

mingled

with

the

dance-drama

being

rehearsed that the fine line between life and

myth gradually dissolves. Puranic myths are
often horrific and fantastical, but no more so
than life itself, as life creates myth and, corres-

pondingly, myth sustains life.
