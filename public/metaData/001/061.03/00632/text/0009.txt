wear square mask on which faces; crowns and
headgear are modelled and painted. They create
the illusion of the wooden, head-heavy puppet,
but give through skilful execution an almost
phantastic animation to the faces; critics have
called them.’ a stroke of genius.’
It is introduced amidst the backdrop of a
Village Fair. In eight beautifully rendered
scenes, the stylised movements of the human

puppets depict various scenes from the
Ramayana, such as the return of Rama from
Ayodhya and his subsequent exile; the cutting
of Surupanakha’s nose; Rawana swearing
vengeance after hearing his sister’s tale of woe;
the abduction of Sita; Jatayu’s encounter with
Ravana; the seeking of aid by Rama from the
Vanaras in regaining Sita; Hanuman’s meeting
with Sita in Ashoka Grove and finally the battle
in which Ravana is killed and the rule ofjustice
re-established.
