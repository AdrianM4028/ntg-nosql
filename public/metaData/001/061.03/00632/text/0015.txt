Thurs. 30th. Nov. ’89

This dance-drama is based on 'I‘agore’s
Chandalika but has undergone radical reinterpretation. The style had to be adapted to
express the folk mood without compromising
technique; body language had to suit the
'I‘antric rituals of the mother without
sensationalism. The intensity of Prakriti’s love
is seen in the abstract as collective movement
for social betterment—the liberation of the
individual is the liberation of the mass. Thus,
the powerful imagery of 'I‘agore’s poetry takes
on different dimensions and implications, with
a “chorus” acting always to broaden the persकुश्या tive of the events on stage.
