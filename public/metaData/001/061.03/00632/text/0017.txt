Fri. 1 st. Dec. ’89
A collection of poems inspired by Mahakabi
Jaydeb’s Geet Govind was the offering to the
eternal search of the “atrna” for the
“paramatma” by the 16 year old Rabindranath
Thakur under the pen-name ‘Bhanusingha’.
Through the medium of an alien language,
“Brzi”, the gifted poet conjured up appealing
yet telling sentiments and imagery around the
Radha-Krishna theme. The dance-drama has
been composed around these poems. The
“sancharis” introduced by Padmasree Guru
Kelucharan Mahapatra are an extension of the
words of the songs which reflect the sanctity of
Vaishnav belief and devotion.
Though the music is in the inimitable Rabindrik
style the “angik abhinay” of the dance has been
set in the “bhangi” of the Odissi. Typical Odissi
rhythmic compositions have been married to
