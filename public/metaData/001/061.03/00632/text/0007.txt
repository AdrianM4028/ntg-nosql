Sun. 26th. Nov. ’89

A misguided young man Bilvamangal, indulges
in all the sensual pleasures of life and falls in
love with a woman of ill-repute.
Seeing his unusually deep involvement with her,
the woman tells him that, if he could love the

Almighty as much as he was devoted to her, he
would attain God. These words make a deep
impression on his mind and change the course
of his life . . . . . . . . Renouncing the life of
pleasure, he makes his way to a forest in search
of Godly Truth - but falls in the same old
worldly trap, at seeing another beautiful
woman at a temple. Disgusted with himself and
realising that his eyes are the cause of leading
him astray, he takes two hairpins from the
woman and pierces his eyes. . . . . . . . .
This blind man was non other than the great
poet Saint Surdas, who, with his inner vision,
illuminated the path of those, who with their

open eyes could not see real Truth.
