This is a Telugu Adaptation by Sri A. R. Krishna of
Harold Pinter‘s

“CARE 'I‘AKER”.

It is considered

as a master-piece coming under the school of Theatre
of the Absurd. A old tramp, Devalraju, is led to
believe by two typical brothers, Anantham and Mutyalu, that he will be employed as
‘Caretaker’ for their property. Lured into relying on the favour of each brother, in turn
he is humiliated by both and ﬁnally he gets a callous heave—no. This is a novel experi—

ment.
