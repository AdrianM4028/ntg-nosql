REPERTORY THEATRE
PR O DU CT l O N — 1

Sri Gurajada Appa R30 is one of the most highly
gifted ﬁgures of modern Telugu lierature and the play was

written by him in 1898. “KANYASULKAM” is the ﬁrst
play written in spoken word of this land and linked it with
broad social problems of the day. All the characters are drawn from the common
people and the play-wright blazed a new trial in the writing of Telugu Drama. He
adapted seemingly simple but forciful language embelished with idiomatic expressions

and dialectical forms. It is the greatest of all the Original Plays in Telugu.
