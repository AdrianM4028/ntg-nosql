In the long line of Indian Dramatic Traditions “MRICCHAKATIKAM” alone has a
cosmopolitan character. This play by King Sudraka of 4th Centrury A.D., is one of
the greatest Plays in Sanskrit literature.

It has been translated into many European

languages and put on boards in USA, Russia and other advanced countries. It deals
with a popular revolution to liberate the Country from foreign domination and with
typical love between Vasantasena and Charudatta. The present play is a Telugu
rendering by Sri Abburi Ramakrishna Rao.
