Repertory

Theatre

The Vidyalaya, which has been ma—
king rapid strides since the date of its
inception felt the absence of a theatre
group of its own to facilitate its successful
students to complete the supplemental
course on the practical side. Apart from
this, real progress in the theatre is difﬁcult without a permanent dramatic group,
a continuing direction and a consistent
policy as to plays. With a view to meet—
ing these needs, the Natya Sangham

brought into being in 1965, a nucleus of a
repertory group as adjunct to the Natya
Vidyalaya.
The Natya Vidyalaya Repertory func—
tions as a work shop for the successful
students of the Vidyalaya providing them
an opportunity to work along with other
experienced actors of the Repertory. It,
thus acts as a permanent theatre ensemble
with a repertory of plays of international
character and universal appeal, always
available for performance.

The Repertory has so far produced
the following plays in Telugu :
