The Andhra Pradesh Natya Sangham,
humny presents this “REPERTORY THEATRE SOUVENIR” on the
4th Repertory Theatre Day.

With a view .to draw the attention

of the public, on the need of a permanent Theatre Company, with
actors in residence and with a repertoire of plays ready for performance, towards realisation of a right Theatre Movement in Andhra
Pradesh.

The Natya Vidyalaya Repertory Theatre was

started

on 20th May I965 and the Repertory has so far produced nine selective plays which won appreciation from one and all in the State and
at New Delhi.

We offer our sincere thanks to various advertisers

who with their

advertisements have helped the cause of the theatre in an exemplanary manner.

Publication of this Souvenir would not have been possible without the

untiring efforts of Sri B. Krishnarn Raju and Sri G. Ramakrishna Rao.
Our thanks are due to all the patrons that have helped the Repertory
in its development and we hope the same in greater proportion in
the coming years also.
