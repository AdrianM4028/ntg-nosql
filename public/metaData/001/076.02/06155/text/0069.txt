art complex is an example of the near-revolution

that can be brought about in any ﬁeld by an
imaginative bureaucracy if given the freedom
area by an equally
to operate in a chosen
imaginative political leadership which thinks it
'
is worthwhile.
The
mountains have moved in Madhya
Pradesh, mountains of lethargy, indifference,
callousness to the arts. In an area so beautiful
it takes your breath away, rich with ancient
monuments, bursting with tribal splendour.
It was imperative that this richness should have
been garnered and given a focus. The other
thing was to give the living arts back to the
people,

particularly

the

classical

tradition in

music and dance, in some cases establish, in
others, revitalise, the connection ............
............ It may be that the intense curiosity one
sees there and the way people are thronging in
the arts complex is because the Prime Minister
inaugurated it and glamorous aura has been built
around it. It is a fact that, as Mrs. Gandhi
remarked, probably nowhere and at no other
time had such big names in music, art and
theatre gathered together in one place. The
value of having a complex like the Bharat
Bhavan, however, is 'that an activity becomes a
continuing process.
Uma Vasudev in Times of India, Delhi, 23 February,
1982.

............ Like the Kalpa Vriksha,

like the visual arts, theatre, poetry, folk dance
and music and folk and tribal arts.

The Bharat

Bhavan is really a "House of Arts” designed by
architect Correa who calls it a “non-building”...

............ In India it is always an event of
unusual
signiﬁcance when an idea actually gets tran
slated
on the ground. When the idea is as comp
lex as
preserving the heritage of a people and
giving
it a chance to ﬂower, and it actually takes
shape,
there is cause for celebration. That is why o
ur
cover story this month is On Bharat Bhavan
, a
cultural institution which has come up in B
hopal

in Madhya Pradesh.

It is the culmination

of

something originally initiated by Educatio
n
Ministry in 1972. All the States of the Union
were asked to ensure that the culture of their
particular regions be given a home, as it- were,
'where it could be preserved and offered oppor-

tunities for growth.
It was an ambitious scheme and everyone assumed

that, as always in India, the idea would remain
a Stray thought On paper. And so it did except
in the case of Bhopal.

A small nucleus of a

painter, an architect, a dramatist was formed and
togather they planned and coordinated and‘ built
the composite structure that is now known as
Bharat Bhavan. Wherever possible, they sought
