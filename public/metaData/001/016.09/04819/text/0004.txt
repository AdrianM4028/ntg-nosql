This play projects the mortal anguish of a man unsure of his identity.
Karnna the protagonist is heroic and heartbroken at the same time as he
tries to ﬁnd his place between the mockery and adulation of social forces
on one side and the taunting challenges of fate on the other.
The treatment of the play reaches beyond caricature of farce, into a realm
that transcends the space and time and gets related to the social realities
of today. Karnna lingers in one’s consciousness as the symbol of Universal
man in search of his own self and the ultimate dilemma of existence.
