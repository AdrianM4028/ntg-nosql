THE PLAY
Aitash intertwines two stories: that of a seventeen-year-old
boy, Arun, who has been remitted to a psychiatric hospital
after he blinded six horses with a metal spike; and that of
his psychiatrist, Dheer, who seeks to uncover the causes of

Arun's bizarre Crime, and for whom the case becomes a
catalyst for his own doubts about his professional and
personal life. Arun has been referred to Dheer by
Mahendra, a compassionate lawyer who serves as Dheer’s
confidante in the play.
Dheer narrates the play, beginning with the image of the
boy embracing a horse. He recounts the story of his

treatment of Arun through therapy, hypnosis and a phony
‘truth drug‘- all leading Arun to abreact or relive the events
leading to the cruel Act. Dheer‘s interviews with Arun’s
parents reveal the mother as middle—class and fervently
religious, while the father, a printer by trade, an atheist and
socialist, proud of his lower—class back ground. Finally, the
father admits to having accidentally observed his son
engaged in a ritual of worship before the picture of a horse
culminating in self-flagellation. Dheer pieces these clues
together to conclude that Arun has created his own

primitive religion based on the horse—cum-god Aitash.
Having obtained work at a stable, Arun has secretly taken
the horses out at night. in the final scene of Act one, he
recreates his naked ride in wild ecstasy as he seeks to

become one with his animal god. As Dheer exposes the
layers of Arun’s psyche, he becomes increasingly reluctant

to make the boy confirm to the ‘normal’ world, which the
psychiatrist percieves as plastic and shrunken, without
worship. He sees his own life as sterile and passionless
and comes to envy Arun’s unique but passionate

psychosis.
