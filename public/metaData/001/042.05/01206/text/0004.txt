After nearly half a decade, truth

has once again become core issue
in all debates in my country :
Cultural as well as Political. I am a
theatre person: a person who

specialises in the production of
spoken word. I am very concerned
about the problems involved in

the manifestation of truth as
spoken word on stage.
Stage is an unreal world. Actor’s
speech is not his own words. It is
given to him. Yet he always strives

to make it ring true. This attempt
at making the word ring true, to

the complete exclusion of
everything else, is the essence of
Indian understanding of Theatre.
Western ideas on theatre also
tackle this problem, but it does so

from the opposite direction. It
tackles falsehood.

limitation. But I have a feeling that

they are yet to understand that
staged reality is the only reality.

action. It had no meaning if one
missed the metaphorical meaning
of salt in Indian life.

British bureaucracy laughed at
Gandhiji when he announced his

intentions to do Salt Satyagraha. It
had absolutely no bearing on the
economic foundations of
colonialism. But this gesture
worked better than anything ever.
But we did not understand the
importance of that gesture. As
Anantamurthy once said, we
