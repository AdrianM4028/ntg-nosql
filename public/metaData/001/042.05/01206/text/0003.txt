Gandhian Studies

and a play

“9/ / .6

To introduce Gandhian studies as
part of our educational ca rricula m,
is a long felt need, voiced at
various times by our policy

makers, and educational bodies.
Introducing a paper on Gandhian
economics or Gandhian
socio-political thoughts for
example, at the level of a graduate
school is far easier than trying a
similar experiment at a drama

school. We do plays. And we need
a production to discuss Gandhiji.
Not that we escape academics. But
at NSD the attempt is to
understand theory, through actual
practice of theatre.
A play can never escape
contemporary realities. In that
sense it always has the potential to
generate controversies. But then

such a logic can at the best avoid
all that is important in our public

life including Gandhiji. Hence we
have asked Mr. I’rasanna to write

and produce a play on Gandhiji.
We told Mr. I’rasanna to treat the
entire production as a process; a
process of understanding and
discussing Gandhiji. We hope that
this effort generates an interest in

his life, work, his ideas of non
violence towards and respects for

all forms of life. However, the
views presented in this play are
not of the institution, but of the

playwright and the director of the

production. We respect the
creative freedom of an artist.
