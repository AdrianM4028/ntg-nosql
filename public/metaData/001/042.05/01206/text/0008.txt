The following is an attempt to
understand Gandhiji through his
opposite. Let us put Gandhiji and
Gandhian ideas against those of
his adversaries and see what
happens. Lets begin with the
fascist dictator Mussoloni.
Mussoloni invited Gandhi ji to

Italy. Gandhiji’s friends cautioned
him, not so much about any
immminent threat to Gandhiji’s

life, but about the extrordinary
slander machine that the fascist
propaganda possessed. Gandhiji
went sufficiently armed. He went
with witnesses and he put down
everything that was said on
record. Mussoloni showed

Gandhiji the enormous wealth he
possessed and started boasting

Gandhiji went up the steps of the
Viceregal palace with supreme
abandon and met the king
emperor exactly the way Churchill
had described him : A half naked
fakir of the east. Later some one

asked Gandhiji about it, and he
answered thus :
Gandhiji : The king had enough on

out the Indian implications of

Gandhiji told him politely but
bluntly that,
szdhiji you are building a house
of cards.

Gandhiji had gone to attend the
Round table Conference. Winston
Churchill reflects the mood of the
British rulers, towards Gandhiji, at
that time, more succinctly than
any one else.

Gandhi, a seditious middle temple

striding half naked up the steps of
