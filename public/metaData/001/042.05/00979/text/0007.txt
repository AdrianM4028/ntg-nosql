DIRECTOR’S NOTE
Seeing some of the performances of the Grips Theatre was a revelation to me. It was

really mortifying to feel that we haven’t given serious thought to childrens’ theatre.
i.e.~ as adding to the social and emotional dimensions of childrens’ lives.
We have taken 4 Grips Theatre plays of which ‘Max and Milli’ is one and given more
than 200 performances of these in Maharashtra. Seeing the responses of children,
parents and teachers has convinced me that this kind of theatre is the best thing that
has happened for children.
Not the play but the concept of this kind of theatre for children is one of German
Theatre’s major contributions to us.
