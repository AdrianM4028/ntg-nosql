villagers of a remote village 250 years ago becomes very
significant for the society of today.

The style of the production is going to be realistic. The style of
pagri of different people, their costumes, the colour of the dress
of the women, jewellery, props of both men and women will be
of that particular period.
Of course the rich cultural heritage of Rajasthan, its full colour
and splendour, its folk music and dance will form an integral part
of the production.
The main purpose of the play is to show the human sacrifice of
the people of 250 years ago to the generation of today. To show
that how a handful of unarmed men and women sacrificed their
lives to save the trees, because they sincerely loved them.
