PLAY

Shri. Ashok Rani, Director of the play has given a new vigorous
meaning to a very old story of human sacrifice for protecting
trees in the play titled "Khejdi Ki Beti". Although the story is 250
years 'old , the director has put it upto date in a modern form and
conveyed a message that trees are not to be cut but are to be
worshipped as it was done in the village of Khejarli in the
erstwhile Jodhpur state in Rajasthan. Whole plot of the play
assumes considerable significance due to its effective message
of maintaining ecological balance for the posterity. The director
has excellently put with clarity of vision and his own workmanship his message into the modern stage craft.
The stage at once comes to life after Ganeshvandana with the
villagers singing and dancing in praise of trees and forest at the
place of guru of Vishnois.
Vishnois celebrate Vanamohatsav, on the stage. At this time a

youth comes to announce the arrival of the wood cutters from
Jodhpu r. Agitation begins among the youths. Head man An nadoji
pleads with them and succeeds in persuading to leave the
village, but without success. Story then tears apart those who
want to protect trees and others who want to cut and in the
second attempt the Vishnois sacrifice their lives and rightly bring
about a change in the outlook of the others.

erstwhile Jodhpur state in Rajasthan, 363 men and women

sacrificed their lives to prevent the cutting of the trees. The
playwright was inspired by this selfless sacrifice and sincerely

felt the sacrifice of these men 250 years back is far more
relevant in today's life wnen environment has become very
