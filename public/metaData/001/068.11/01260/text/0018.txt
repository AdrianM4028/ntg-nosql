'Arturo Ui
at School premises.

Director's Interpretation :
Arturo Ui

was written while Brecht was in exile but was staged for the first.

time after his death.

In this parable, which is available in different

variations, Brecht tries to represent the rise of the national socialism
as an example of a gangster-gang.

His figures are : Dogsborough...

Hindenburg, Arturo Ui...Hitler, GirimGorig, G ivola

Goebbels etc,

The work is written in the ciassic metre of the Jambers which should
make plain the contrast between form and content.

Parodies from

ﬁrfto'usﬂpartstin the German classical literature are inserted.
