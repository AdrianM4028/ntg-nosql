An ordinary man will go to the God through his faith. Logic brings
him down to the soil through the reality and making the people

aware.

But one when being associate with other with full of belief,

innocence and simplicity, that gay tries to get benefit from him.

That is the question.

Shouldn't a man believe to other? ,Was

Marias wrong to make belief towards Ceasar ?

Or in this crucial

moment one should behave like Antony—who is neither Ceasar nor

Marias !

A country engulfed with the darkness of illiteracy will give

birth the people like Ceasar, there the death of Marias is inevitable.
