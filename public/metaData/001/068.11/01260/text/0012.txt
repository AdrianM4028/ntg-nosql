Note

Still now ‘Garvoboti Janani' is a wonderful experience to me.

Yes.

I am telling it an experience rather than a drama. Bijan Bhattacharya
has written a terrible experience which turned into a drama throught
his magic pen.

Thats‘ fun.

We can see stern reality smiles in one

hand and on the other we can get figurative view with ferocious
teeth where real and unreal things make a burning truth. Yes, it is
true indeed. We have no courage to searchout that truth which
pointed its finger to this eXperience. Though we work in a drousad situation following the Bijon Bhattacharya’s magic writing. ll
that work is appreciated by any one the lionshare of the credit goes

to that wizard.

The rest of the credit will be shared by the actor,
actress. students and artists. I only share the demerits of it.
