D i recto r 's l n t e r pre t a t i o n :

Having gone through the drama I was confused with two things

viz (i) conflict between Idealism Er Realism.

ii) How man meta-

phased to God 7

I became upset thinking how Hitler 8 Musoliny got converted to
to Hitler Er Musoliny respectively and how Ceasar changed his for—

tune becorning God from an ordinary soldier.
Ceasar tried to get united with Marias but failed as Marias was made

it OUt thoroughly that 'Ceasar is a God’ to shell himself with the shield
of God,

The attitude of Antony is cristal clear,

Ceasar is none but a human

being to him. The acute judgement of Ceasar towards reality-Ceasar
feels an attraction to Antony but the deep reSpect Of Marias disturb

him,

He becomes afraid.

Pseudocover is brittle in nature, though

it is neither an absolute truth nor it becomes a drama.
