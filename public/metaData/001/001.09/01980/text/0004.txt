SYNOPSIS

Abhimanyu is ever trapped in the Chakravyuha

Here’s a land,
Where the righteous Amatyas and Acharyas

By the seven charioteers !

Feel reluctant to give counsel :

Draupadi is ever dragged by the hair and shamed

The teacher and the priest are averse to studies :

And Shakuni is ever alive !!

Mere nepotism is called efﬁciency :

In the evil net of revenge, deceit and conspiracy
is caught

Oppression-and— suppression reigns

In the name of administering the

subjects;

Man’s eternal image!

The wise suffers humiliation at the hands of rulers है

The consequence is—

Women and children are victims

The blood-bath of Kurulrshetra !!

0f everyday exploitation-—

Dwapar or Kali—-

It is the same want of insight
This empire of the Kauravas
And the same currupt way of rulers!
Will soon see its doom.”

—Mahabha‘rata unwithered by age !!

Hence— “DUHSHASANA”
