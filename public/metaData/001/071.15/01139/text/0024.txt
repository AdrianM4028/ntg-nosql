PRESS QUOTES ON ‘GHASHIRAM KOTWAL' FROM EUROPE.
London

London has had no World Theatre Season for five years and this breif visit (ending on
Sunday) by the Theatre Academy of Pune would surely have been trailed, in the old
days, as an outstanding occasion. The evening proves exhilarating and irresistible.
Michael Coveney, Financial Times,
A controversial Indian play now in London, could be an inspiration to western drama.
Kenneth Rea, Arts Guardian,
With the whole range of folk traditions to choose from, Jabbar Patel's production for the
Theatre Academy of Pune has no need to use Western nudity or violence to evoke
eroticism or torture. Underneath all the action, a steady drumming and musical
accompaniment provides another layer of compelling interest.
— The Times, London

You would be crazy to miss an event that makes much of Western Experimental Theatre
look like doodling in a bathroom mirror.
— Time Out, London
To western eyes the interest of the production will be its spectacle, its unusual music and
the performances of Mohan Agashe as the elegantly sinister Chancellor and Ramesh
Tilekar as the rouge who turns into a crazy despot.
