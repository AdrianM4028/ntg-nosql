Message
I am glad to know that the Institute of Home Economics is furthering
the cause of women's education by planning a new building to house the
College. The role of voluntary effort in the cause of women's education
can hardly be over—stressed. The Government both at the national and the
State level is handicapped by lack of resources to expand women's educa—
tion to the maximum Therefore, the efforts put in by social workers and
voluntary organisations become very valuable and help towards achieving
the goal of universal isation of education.

I send my best wishes on this occasion and hope that the institute
will grow from strength to strength in the years to come.
