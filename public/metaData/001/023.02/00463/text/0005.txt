Message
The Institute of Home Economics has grown from a small
beginning of its present academic status through the spirit of
devotion and hard work of staff and students. It has now reached
a point where the present hired accornodation is insufficient to meet
the demands of women for Home Science Education.
The Institute has acquired land for a new building but funds
are desperately needed for its construction. Efforts of staff and
students to collect funds for construction of the building are worthy
of full support from all well wishers of the community.
I have no doubt at all, that given the new building the
Institute will expand to offer Master's courses in Home Science
subjects and maintain the high academic standards in this pro—
fessional education. Through this field of Education the Institute
will not only be serving the community, but the nation at large.

My best wishes for the fund raising drive.
