I am extremely happy to know that the Institute of Home Economics
is planning to construct its new building at a plot of

land allotted for

this purpose at Hauz Khas.
The institute is rendering invaluable service to the communitbe
promoting professional education among the women. The spirit with
which it was started and the result that it has achieved are indeed
commendable.

The education of women has a very important role in the change of
the social fabric of our society. It is through education of women that
- the educational development of the future generations can be ensured.
Whatever investment is made for this purpose will bring rich dividends to
the society.

I wish to convey my best wishes for the success of the efforts to
raise the funds for'this nobel cause.

I look forward to the day when the Institute will move to its new
premises .
