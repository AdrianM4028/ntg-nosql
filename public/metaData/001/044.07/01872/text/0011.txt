Nice Experience

In the free atmosphere, Under the cluster of folk arts, with different people and different
traditions. An experience of coming close to the soil. On the surface of relations, Playing
hide & seek... the warmth of the rising sun, and, the setting noon’s chill. In the ocean of
art, On the raft of experience, In the company of a Columbus —Reaching out in search of a
new island!

, It is my first experience of participating in this type of practical theatre workshop.
Throughout the workshop I enjoyed the environment, observed the traditional culture.
' this will bring a new horizon in my life.
I had attended some lecture demonstrations on ”Chhau” in my class. But it is my
privilege in this Orissa tour to observe “CHHAU” directly, from a closer angle and
understand its depth.
So far as my knowledge is concerned ”CHHAU" is best for an actor to understand body
language.
Hope the Play "BAGGAD BILLA” will prove our efficiency
