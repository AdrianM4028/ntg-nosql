३ IN the depth of forest a little away from the silent river By the side of the lake, .
३ ३ A peaceful corner Which, in a few days turned into ’home’Where, every dwelllng soul
' came close to each other. Every corner my vision fluttered it was mine-my own. Never
thought that the heart can find a home anytime, anywhere, Yet, building a home is
different everytirne. The strong hand that built it - the man, whose name Does notmake a
, difference even if I don’t pronounce it, You would understand - you would preceive the
~ ’who’ 8: how How he taught us to make our home in this wilderness. Now, thls home
away from home has made a home in our heart. Built out of happiness music -rhythm,

melody And the golden touch of the sun emerging from the mist ~filling our every
moment, every hour with warmth

I think the main idea behind this workshop was to observe nature, environment,

traditions around us minutely and imbibe the maximum possible. Infact I like the
”KIR’I‘AN” very much. Here we are not confined to ourselves as we are in big cities like
Delhi. As an actress it is my desire that these type of workshops should take place time to
time.
