ON THREE PENNY OPERA
There is no reason why John Gay’s motto for his
Beggar's operanos haec navimus esse ni‘iril should be changed for the Three Penny Opera. Its
publication represents little more than the
prompt-book of a play wholly surrendered to
theatres, and thus is directed at the expert rather
than at the consumer. This doesn’t mean that the
conversion of the maximum number of readers or
spectators into experts is not thoroughly
desirable; indeed it is under way.

The Three Penny Opera is concerned
with
bourgeois conceptions not only as content,
by
representing them, but also through the
manner
in which it does so. It is a kind of repor
t on life
as any member of the audience would
like to see
it. Since at the same time, however,
he sees a
good deal that he has no wish
to see; since

therefore he sees his wishes not merely
fulfilled
but also criticized. (sees himself not as
the subject
but as the object), he is theoretically in
a position
2

to appoint a new function for the theatre. But the
theatre itself resists any alteration of its function,
and so it seems desirable that the spectator
should read plays whose aim is not merely to be
performed in the theatre but to change it: out of
mistrust of the theatre. Today we see the theatre
being given absolute priority over the actual ,
plays.
The theatre apparatus’s priority is a
priority of means of production. This apparatus
resists all conversion to other purposes, by taking
any play which it encounters and immediately
changing it so that it no longer represents a

foreign body within the apparatus
— except at
those points where it neutralizes itsel
f. The
necessity to stage the new drama correctl
y - which
matters more for the theatre’s sake than
for the
drama’s - is modified by the fact that
the theatre
can stage anything: it theatres it all
down. Of
course this priority has economic
reasons.
