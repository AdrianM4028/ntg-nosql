tion, I realise.

Let us briefly return to Einstein’s
Theory of Relativity and understand

the basic reason why even his physics
is now regarded an extension of
classical thought. The causal development of events as understood in
classical physics and the distinction

between object and observer remains
nearly intact in even Einstein’s theo-

ries while the truly radical physics of
today, for which he himself laid the
ground, seeks to eradicate such sharp

divisions.
By breaking the main character into

three, the play seeks to tel l the story in
a linear fashion. But at the same time,

it effectively destroys that very l i nearity
through mutual tension and interaction between three images ofth e same
character. The Einsteins in the play
arethreetriangularly arranged mi rrors

which endlessly reflect and re-reﬂect
the character forming many images
of each other in the mind of the

spectator. This is the complexity I am
really interested in, which incidentally
hints at the post-Einsteinian physical
thought—today regarded as radical
physics.
