they pursued policies which, if
persisted in for some time, might
have led to the development of a

composite ruling class consisting of i
all sections in the Mughal nobility
as well as the Rajputs and the
Marathas. The major obstacle in
this process was that apart from the
Saiyids there were no powerful
groups or sectibns at the court or
outside it which were actively

interested in such a development.

The ‘Alamgiri nobles, or the section
often described as the “Mughals”
were generally averse to sharing

power with anyone, deeming only
themselves ﬁt for the task of
governing the empire. Most of the

Marathi sardars were mainly
concerned with establishing a
‘domination over the Deccan, and
were not interested in the

. maintenance of the Mughal empire.
The Rajputs had a larger interest
than the Marathas in the maintenance
of the Mughal empire, having
secured many Opportunities of
advancement and gain in the service

of the empire. They might have
been expected to give full support
to the Saiyids whose policies were
in consonance with their own desires.
Ajit Singh and Jai Singh were also
beholden to the Saiyids for many
' favours. However, neither of these

Rajas made any effort to render
military aid to the Saiyids in their
hour of need, preferring to engross
themselves in their local ambitions.
Thus, the Saiyids were brought
face to face with the old dilemma
that the forces of integration were

woefully weak in Medieval society,
and only a strong central government
could keep them in check. In the
absence of a competent monarch, a

strong central government could
have been established by a wazir if
he enjoyed either the support of a
powerful section of the nobility, or
the backing of a well-established

monarchy. The former the Saiyids
could not secure, for reasons already
indicated. The Saiyids were keen to

preserve the Tirmurid monarchy as
a symbol of unity. But the traditional
suspicion between the monarch and
an all-powerful wazir vitiated the
atmospher, and made co-operation
between the two extremely diﬂicult
to achieve. Personal factors further

aggravated the differences.
Although the Saiyid experiment
lacked the elements of permanence
for the reasons described above, the

“new” wizdrat which they sought
to establish is not without

signiﬁcance. The Saiyids made a
deﬁnite break with narrow,
exclusionist policies, and moved in
the direction of establishing a state
essentially secular in approach and

national in character. Their downfall
did not imply the automatic negation

of this process which they had

stimulated and Strengthened: it
continued to work apace and

inﬂuenced the political and cultural
developments of the succeeding
period.
