ghosts is one of a group 01 plays 0n the theme that accessed
Ibsen all his life : the way that we are deminated oy the past.

'We saii,' he writes,'with a corpse in the cargo.’ Here its
particular aspect is the Sins or tne fatnerﬁ.
'I am inclined to think that we're all ghosts, raster -anders;
it's not Only the tnings that we've inherited from our fathers and
mothers that live on in ua, out all sorts of old dead ideas and
ole dean oeiiefs, and things of that sort.......tnd we are all o;f
us so pitiful aIraiu ox tue iignt.' says -rs. diving, one of the
central character of the glay. One OI the notes to this pia ,
Ibsen wrote nimeeir ' The whole mankind is on the wrong track'.

It indicates that he never wanted to snow the tragedy of are. Alving
alone but he intended to project the sufferings of the bourgeois

in Euroye of that time. He wanted that mankind can once again
came out of all those sufferings by a moral revolution.
ﬂsinly the plays deals with the social critisism or 19th
Century. Ibsen tries to substitute the modern Scientific concept
of heridity for the creek idea of fate.

The whole series of action

are Just attec: on society and the standard oy which it lives.

And for this purpose Ibsen selected the enaracters from 318 own
eountry Norway in the city of Rosenvold.

As this is a symDOiio but realistic play, everythingﬁ is
represented as a symbol of another. Mainly it deals with the
tragedy 0: .rs. Alving who is living with dead ideas and dead
conventions and these are symuoiized as the 'ghoets'.
