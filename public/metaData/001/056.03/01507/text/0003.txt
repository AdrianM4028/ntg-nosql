The Plot of the Play
Bhasa is a brilliant luminary in the ﬁrrnarnent
of Sanskrit drama. Flourishing in B.C. 600,
he is respectfully mentioned by Kalidasa
who was a spectator of his plays during the

reign of King Vikramaditya of 100 B.C. of
the 14 plays which are extant, Bhasas
Charudattam is a delightful Tragi-comedy.
Charudatta the son of a rich merchant has

lost all his wealth by assisting his numerous
friends in need. The beautiful Courtesan
Vasanta Sena falls in love with him.
Shakaara, the brother-in-law and police
ofﬁcer of the King, is after her and accosts
her rudely one day when she is out for
worship. Vasanta Sena takes shelter in
Charudatta’s house and leaves her gold
ornaments there for custody.
Sajjalaka, the thief steals the gold ornaments
in order to redeem his lady-love Madanika
from the service of Vasantsena. Brahmani,
as the loyal wife offers her priceless pearl
necklace to Charudatta to make up Vasantsena’s loss.
Vasantsena gives Madanika in marriage to
Sajjalaka and decks her with her own stolen
ornaments while she herself gets ready to
return the pearl necklace to Charudatta.

The play ends with Abhisarika-Nritya—a
special dance designed for women when
they go to meet their lovers on a dark and
thunderous night in which the clouds dance
and rejoice with her.
