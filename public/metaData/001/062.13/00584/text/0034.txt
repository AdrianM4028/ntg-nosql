M EIIAG E

| send out my heartiest greetings and good wishes to “HIMANI

KALA ROOP" who are organising an Art show “Mausam Hai Barish Ka"
on Friday, the 24th June, 4977 at Fine Arts Theatre, Rafi Marg, New Delhi,
in the memory of my late father Shri Ram Singh Ji, who devoted most of

his life in the development of Art and Culture through social educational

functions and drames.

I hope, the organisers will keep up the rich tradi-

tions, promote and recognise the drama talent, by distributing prizes to

Best Actor, Best Actress and the Best Rising Star of the day.
