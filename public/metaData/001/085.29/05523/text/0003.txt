Directorial note on “CI-IAKRAVYUHA”

Abhirnanyu is slaughtered on the thirteen day of battle of Kurukshetra
when he enters the Chakravyuha but is unable to come out of
it. His father, Arjuna, was engaged in a battle elsewhere. In this
episode Yudhisthira the embodiment of truth is not true to his word,
for knowing that Abhimanyu cannot come out of the Chakravyuha
he sends him into it, prornosing reinforcement. The reinforcement
never reach. The Kaurayas too use foul methods. And thus a fearless sixteen year. old boy is treacherously butcherd by the Saptarathis
the seven charioteers who along with their armies from the spirals of
the Chakravyuha. This play which deals with this particular episode
raised several questions triggerred of by the slaying of Abhimanyu.
