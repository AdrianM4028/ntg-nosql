Directorial Note on “URUBHANGAM”

The only tragedy in Classical Indian Drama. Bhasa's 'URUBHANGAM'
blooms like a white lily among the Sanskrit plays because of the
dimensional approach and portayal of human quality.

Each and

every Slokkas written by Bhasa in this play is merely not a narration
but so acverb of climax which he hadles very carefully with a number

of Pataksthana (dramatic irony) and that is why we place him as one
of the most important playwright of the Classical golden age.
The present play is one of the masterpiece based on Hindu Epic
Mahabharattawhlco we present you in a stylised experimentation

with contemporary aspects including the behaviour

of

common

people (soldier) and their relationship with men leaders and political
victi ms.
