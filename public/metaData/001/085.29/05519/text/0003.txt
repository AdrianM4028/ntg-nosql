Director's Note
To interpret traditions from
modern point of View is in itself a
controversial and complicated task.

Its more true when the traditions
are religious rituals. This is a sincere and humble attempt to find
dramatic elements in Muslim rituals

and present them artistically 1n
modern idiom. These dramatic elements are comprehensively present
in ritualistic performances of Siddi
Tribe, for Siddis have migrated
from Africa and settled in India
several centuries back bringing
with them their own rituals and tra—
ditions. 1 do not hesitate to accept
that this is not a well—made play but
a ritualistic performance in itself.
Siddis are aborigines and not acquainted with Urdu language. Hence
there might be many shortcomings
in their performace. Yet they should
be encouraged so that they would
realize their potential and try to
prlore new meanings to their rituals.
