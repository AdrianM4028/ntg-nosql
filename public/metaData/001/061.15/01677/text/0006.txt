D I R E CT0 R ’S PLEA

Bertolt Brecht’s ‘ Der gute
/ l MenschVonSezuan’(The
Good Person of Szechwan)
has been a favourite with
the Indian directors. Even
Nandikar once did a production of this play and it
है earned a name. So why
produce the same old play

हैं even though newly adapअभी ted? One could spin off
umpteen reasons : it is healthy for the theatre to
indulge in classics; the play allows you to
involve a great number of actors and offers the
fun of multiple games for a multitude; you
could atone for the ‘consumerism’ of such a
useful play which Nandikar did in 1974 under
organisational and financial duress; or simply, I
LOVE THIS PLAY. But the reason which impels
me to return to this play is different : Ours is a
time when the moral ground under our feet is
slippery, when equations between Good and
Evil are tricky, when human goodness is becoming an expendable item. The Good Person challenges us to hazard a journey to goodness, and
excites us to synthesise the individual’s Good
with the Good of the others. And that for the
Director the Challenge of our time.
A few words more. Be. it noted that I am no
director of this play in the conventional sense.
