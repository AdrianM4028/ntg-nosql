Blessed by the gods, Janaki opens a small
shop, her sole aim being to be good and to do
good to others. Easier planned than done : the
landlady demands her share, the lover demands
his dowry, the riff-raffs demand bowls of rice
and the rich merchant demands her body. The
‘Sukanya’ is at a loss.
At early dawn, a stranger enters the shop,
with fire in his eyes and thunder in his voice. His
name is Janardan; he is Janaki’s cousin.

The cousin now holds sway and all are
afraid. Trade flourished by his cunning. But
only Janaki is nowhere to be found. Wails are
heard—the heart-rending wails of a pregnant
Janaki. Rumours are that Janardan has murdered his sister. He is arrested and brought to
Court where the gods sit as judges. The question is : keeping the social order unchanged,
will the gods be able to fulfil Janaki’s dreams?
