But let a woman in your life
And your serenity is through!
She 'll redecorate your home
From the cellar to the dome;

Then get on to the enthralling
Fun of overhauling
You.

I'm a quiet living man
Who prefers to spend his evenings
In the silence of his room;
Who likes an atmosphere as restful
As an undiscovered tomb.
A pensive man am I

Of philosophic joys;
Who likes to meditate,
Oh, let a woman in your life

And you are up against the wall!
Make a plan and you will find
She has something else in mind;
And so rather than do either
You do something else that neither
Likes a t all.

You want to talk of Keats or Milton;

She only wants to talk of love.
You go to see a play or ballet,
And spend it searching for her glove.
Oh, let a woman in your life

And you invite eternal strife!
Let them buy their wedding bands
For those anxious little hands;
I'd be equally as willing
,
For a dentist to be drilling
Than to ever let a woman in my life!
I'm a very gentle man;
Even-tempered and good-natured,
Whom you never hear complain;

Con templa te,
Free from humanity's mad, inhuman noise.
lust a quiet living man.
But let a woman in your life
And your sabbatical is through!
In a line that never ends
Come an army of her friends;
Come to jabber and to chatter
And to tell her what the matter
Is with you.

She’ll have a booming, boist'rous fam'ly
Who will descend on you en masse.
She'll have a large Wagnerian mother
With a voice that shatters glass!
Oh, let a woman in your life

Let a woman in your life
Let a woman in your life
I shall never let a woman in my life!

Who has the milk of human kindness

By the quart in ev’ry vein.

A patient man am I
Down to my fingertips;
The sort who never could,

Ever would,
Let an insulting remark escape his lips.

A very gentle man.
But let a woman in your life
And patience hasn't got a chance.

She will beg you for advice;
Your reply will be concise.
And she’ll listen very nicely
then go out and do precisely
What she wants!
You were a man of grace and polish
Who never spoke above a hush.
Now all at once you 're using language
That would make a sailor blush.

Oh, let a woman in your life
And you are plunging in' a knife!
Let the others of my sex
Tie the knot - around their necks;
I'd prefer a new edition
Of the Spanish Inquisition
than to ever let a woman in my life!

ELIZA:
lust you wait, ’enry 'iggins, just you wait!
You 'll be sorry but your tears 'll be too late!
You 'll be broke and I’ll have money;
Will I help you? Don’t be funny!
just you wait, 'enry ’iggins, just you wait!
lust you wait, ’enry 'iggins, till you 're sick,
And you scream to fetch a doctor double-quick.
I 'll be off a second later
And go straight to the the-atre!
Oh ho ho, 'enry ’iggins, just you wait!

Ooooooooh 'enry ’iggins!
lust you wait until we 're swimmin' in the sea!
Ooooooooh 'enry ’iggins!
And you get a cramp a little way from me!

When you yell you 're going to drown
I'll get dressed and go to town!
Oh ho ho, ’enry 'iggins!
Oh ho ho, ’enry 'iggins!
Just you wait!
