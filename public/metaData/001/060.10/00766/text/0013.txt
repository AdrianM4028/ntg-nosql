Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour

Out of ev'ry door?
No, it '5 just on the street where you live!
And oh! the towering feeling
lust to know somehow you are near!
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear!
People stop and stare. They don 't bother me.
For there’s nowhere else on earth that I would
rather be.
Let the time go by,
I won 't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live.

HIGGINS:
Shortly after we came . in
I saw at once we 'd eas'ly win;

And after that I found it deadly dull.
PICKERING:
You should have heard the ooh's and ah 's;
Ev 'ry one wond'ring who she was.
HIGGINS:
You 'd think they ’d never seen a lady before.
PICKERING:
And when the Prince of Transylvania
Asked to meet her,

And gave his arm to lead her to the floor....!

I said to him: You did it!
You did it! You did it!
They thought she was ecstatic
And so damned aristocratic,

People stop and stare. They don ’t bother me.
For there’s nowhere else on earth that I would
rather be.

Let the time go by,

I won ’t care if I
Can be here on the street where you live.

And they never knew
That you
Did it!
HIGGINS:
That blackguard who uses the science of speech
More to blackmail and swindle than teach;
He made it the devilish business of his
'To find out who this Miss Doolittle is. '
Ev’ry time we looked around
There he was, that hairy hound
From Budapest.
Never have I ever known

You did it
I’ICKERING:
Tonight, old man, you did it!
You did it! You did it!
You said that you would do it,
And indeed you did.
I thought that you would rue it;
I doubted you ’d do it.
But now I must admit it
That succeed you did.
You should get a medal
Or be even made a knight.
HIGGINS:
It was nothing. Really nothing.
I’ICKERING :
All alone you hurdled
Ev'ry obstacle in sight.
HIGGINS:
Now, wait! Now, wait!

Give credit where it’s due.

A ruder pest.
Fin’lly I decided it was foolish
Not to let him have his chance with her
So I stepped aside and let him dance with her.
Oozing charm from ev'ry pore,
He oiled his way around the floor.
Ev'ry trick that he could play,
He used to strip her mask away.
And when at last the dance was done
He glowed as if he knew he 'd won!
And a smile too broad,
He announced to the hostess

That she was a fraud!
Her English is too good, he said,

Which clearly indicates that she is foreign.
Whereas others are instructed in their native
language
English people aren.
And although she may have studied with an
expert
Di'lectician and grammarian,

I can tell that she was born Hungarian!
SERVANTS:
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

A lot of glory goes to you.

I’ICKERING :
But you 're the one who did it,
Who did it, who did it!
As sturdy as Gibraltar,

Not a second did you falter.
There ’5 no doubt about it,

You did it!
I must have aged a year tonight.
At times I thought I’d die of fright.
Never was there a momentary lull.
