Without you

I've grown accustomed to
her face

ELIZA:
What a fool I was! What a dominated fool!
To think you were the earth and sky.
What a fool I was! What an addIe-pated fool!
What a mutton-headed dolt was I!
No, my reverberating friend,

HIGGINS:
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
She whistles night and noon.
Her smiles. Her frowns.

You are not the beginning and the end!

Are second nature to me now;

There '11 be spring ev'ry year without you.
England still will be here without you.
There ’11 be fruit on the tree.
And a shore by the sea,
There'll be crumpets and tea
Without you.

Her ups, her downs,

Like breathing out and breathing in.
I was serenely independent and content before
we met;

Surely I could always be that way againand yet
I've grown accustomed to her looks;
Accustomed to her voice:

Accustomed to her face.

Art and music will thrive without you.
Somewa Keats will survive without you.
And there still will be rain

I can see her now:

On that plain down in Spain,
Even that will remain
Without you.

I can see her now;

I can do

Without you.
You, dear friend, who talk so well,

You can go to Hertford, Hereford, and

Hampshire!
They can still rule the land without you.
Windsor Castle will stand without you.
And without much ado
We can all muddle through
Without you!

Without your pulling it, the tide comes in,
Without your twirling it, the earth can spin.
Without your pushing them, the clouds roll by.
If they can do without you, ducky, so can I!

I shall not feel alone without you.
I can stand on my own without you.
So go back in your shell,

I can do bloody well
Without...
HIGGINS:
By George, I really did it!
I did it! I did it!
I said I'd make a woman
And indeed I did!
I knew that I could do it!
I knew it! I knew it!
I said I'd make a woman
And succeed I did!

Mrs Freddy Eynsford—Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
Not a penny in the till,
And a bill-collector beating at the door.
She’ll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flow’rs instead;
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed!
In a year or so
When she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to
chalk,

She'll come home and lo!
He'll have upped and run away
With a social climbing heiress from New York!
Poor Eliza!
How simply frightful!
How humiliating!
How delightful!
I 'm a most forgiving man;
The sort who never could,
Ever would,

Take a position and staunchly never budge.
lust a most forgiving man.
But I will never take her back,

If she were crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone!
Let her shiver, let her moan!

I will slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!
But I'm so used to hear her say
Good morning every day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows

Are second nature to me now,Like breathing out and breathing in.
I’m very grateful she 's a woman
And so easy to forget;
Rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace
Of something in the air;
Accustomed to her face.
