The overpowering feeling

That any second you may suddenly appear! दृ
People stop and stare. They don 't...

Speak and the world is full of singing,

ELIZA:
Words! Words! Words! I’m sick of words!
I get words all day through;
First from him, now from you!

Don’t talk of stars
Burning above;

JAMIE, HARRY, AND FRIENDS:
There '5 just a few more hours.
That 's all the time you ’ve got.
A few more hours
Before they tie the knot.
DOOLI'ITLE:

If you 're in love,

I'm getting married in the morning!

Show me!

Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.
Pull out the stopper!
Let's have a whopper!
But get me to the church on time!

Is that all you blighters can do?

Tell me no dreams
Filled with desire.

If you 're on fire,
Show me!

Here we are together in the middle of the

I gotta be there in the mornin'
Spruced up and lookin' in me prime.
Girls, come and kiss me;

night!
Don’t talk of spring! just hold me tight!

Anyone who's ever been in love ’11 tell you that
This is no time for a chat!

Show how you 'll miss me.
But get me to the church on time!
If I am dancin ’
Roll up the floor.
If I am whistlin'

Haven 't your lips
Longed for my touch?

Whewt me out the door!

Don 't say how much,
Show me! Show me!

Don 't talk of love lasting through time.
Make me no undying vow.
Show me now!

Sing me no song!
Read me no rhyme!
Don ’t waste my time,

Show me!

Don 't talk of lune!
Don ’t talk of fall!
Don 't talk at all!
Show me!

For I 'm gettin' married in the mornin'
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.
Kick up a rumpus
But don ’t lose the compass;
And get me to the church,
Get me to the church,
For Cawd's sake, get me to the church on time!

DOOLI'ITLE AND EVERYONE:
I'm getting married in the morning
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.
Drug me or jail me,

Stamp me and mail me.
ALL:
But get me to the church on time!
