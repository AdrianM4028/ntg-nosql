I could have danced all

Ascot Gavotte

night
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:
Ev’ry duke and earl and peer is here.

ELIZA: ८
Bed! Bed! I couldn’t go to bed!
My head's too light to try to set it down!

Ev'ry one who should be here is here.
What a smashing, positively dashing
Spectacle: the Ascot op'ning day.

Sleep! Sleep! I couldn’t sleep tonight!
Not for all the jewels in the crown!

At the gate are all the horses

I could have danced all night!
I could have danced all night!
And still have begged for more.
_I could have spread my wings
And done a thousand things
I've never done before.
I’ll never know
What made it so exciting;
Why all at once

My heart took flight.
I only know when he
Began to dance with me,
I could have danced, danced, danced all night!

Waiting for the cue to fly away.
What a gripping, absolutely ripping
Moment at the Ascot op'ning day.

Pulses rushing!

Faces flushing!
Heartbeats speed up!
I have never been so keyed up!

Any second now
They 'll begin to run.
Hark! a bell is ringing,
They are springing
Forward
Look! It has begun ...!

It's after three, now.

What a frenzied moment that was!
Didn't they maintain an exhausting pace?
'Twas a thrilling, absolutely chilling

SECOND SERVANT:

Running of the Ascot op ’ning race.

FIRST SERVANT:

Don 't you agree, now,

She ought to be in bed?

ELIZA:
I could have danced all night!
I could have danced all night!
And still have begged for more.
I could have spread my wings
And done a thousand things
I've never done before.
I'll never know
What made it so exciting,
Why all at once
My heart took flight.
I only know when he
Began to dance with me

There they are again
Lining up to run.
Now they’re holding steady,
They are ready
For it.

I could have danced, danced, danced all night!
MRS PEARCE: I understand, dear. It 's all been

grand, dear.
But now it ’s time to sleep.
ELIZA:
I could have danced all night!
I could have danced all night!
And still have begged for more.
. I could have spread my wings
And done a thousand things
I've never done before.
I'll never know
What made it so exciting,

Why all at once

My heart took flight.
I only know when he
Began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced all night!

FREDDY:
When she mentioned how her aunt bit off the
spoon,
She completely done me in.
And my heart went on a journey to the moon,
When she told about her father and the gin.
And I never saw a more enchanting farce,

Than the moment when she shouted ’move your
bloomin '... '
I have often walked down this street before;
But the pavement always stayed beneath my
feet before.

All at once am I
Several stories high,
Knowing I'm on the street where you live.
