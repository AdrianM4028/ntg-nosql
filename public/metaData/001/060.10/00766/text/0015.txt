Yes. Why can 't a woman be more like a man?

I gotta be there in the morning
Spruced up and lookin’ in me prime.
DOOLI'I'I‘LE:
Some bloke who '5 able

Men are so honest, so thoroughly square;
Eternally noble, historically fair;
Who when you win will always give your back

Lift up the table,

a pat.

ALL:

Why can ’t a woman be like that .7
Why does ev’ryone do what the others do?
Can 't a woman learn to use her head?

And get me to the church on time!

DOOLI'I'I‘LE:
If I am flying
Then shoot me down.
If I am wooin',
Get her out of town!
ALL:
For I ’m getting married in the morning!

Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.

Why do they do everything their mothers do?
Why don 't they grow up like their fathers
instead?
Why can ’t a woman take after a man?
Men are so pleasant, so easy to please;
Whenever you’re with them you ’re always at
ease.

L‘CX3LI'I'TLE:
Feather and tar me;
Call out the Army;

But get me to the church.
ALL:
Get me to the church
DOOLIT'I‘LE:
For Gawd’s sake, get me to the church on time!!

HARRY AND EVERYONE:
Starlight is reelin' home to bed now.
Mornin' is smearin’ up the sky.
London is wakin'.
Daylight is breakin'.

Would you be slighted if I didn't speak for
hours?
Would you be livid if I had a drink or two?
Would you be wounded if I never sent you
flowers?
Why can 't a woman be like you?
One man in a million may shout a bit.
Now and then there '5 one with slight defects.
One perhaps whose truthfulness you doubt a bit.
But by and large we are a marvellous sex!

Good luck, old churn,

Why can 't a woman behave like a man?

Good health, good-bye.
DOOLI'I'I'LE:
I'm gettin’ married in the mornin'
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime
Hail and salute me
Then haul off and boot me
And get me to the church,
Get me to the church
For Gawd's sake, get me to the church on time!

Men are so friendly, good-natured, and kind;

A better companion you never will find.
If I were hours late for dinner, would you
bellow?

If I forgot your silly brithday, would you fuss?
Would you complain if I took out another
fellow?
Why can ’t a woman be like us?
Why can 't a woman be more like a man?
Men are so decent, such regular chaps.

Ready to help you through any mishaps.
Ready to buck .you up whenever you are glum.
Why can 't a woman be a chum?
Why is thinking something women never do?
Why is logic never ever tried?
Straightening up their hair is all they ever do.
Why don't they straighten up the mess that’s
inside?

Why can 't a woman be more like a man?

HIGGINS:
What in all of Heaven could have prompted
her to go?
After such a triumph at the ball?
What could have depressed her?
What could have possessed her?
I cannot understand the wretch at all!

Women are irrational, that's all there is to

that!

If I were a woman who ’d been to a ball,
Been hailed as a princess by one and by all;

Would I start weeping like a bathtub
overflowing?
And carry on as if my home were in a tree?
Would I run off and never tell me where I'm

going?
Why can ’t a woman be like me?
