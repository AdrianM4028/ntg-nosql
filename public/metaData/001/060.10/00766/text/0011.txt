One day I'll be famous! I'll be proper and prim;
Go to St fames so often I will call it St Iim!

One evening the King will say: ’Oh, Liza, old
thing,

I want all of England your praises to sing.
Next week on the twentieth of May
I proclaim Liza Doolittle Day!
All the people will celebrate the glory of you,
And whatever you wish and want I gladly will
do. '

Quit, Professor Higgins!
Quit, Professor Higgins!
Hear our plea
Or payday we
Will quit, Professor Higgins!
Ay not I,

0 not Ow,
Pounding, pounding in our brain.
Ay not I,
0, not Ow,

Don ’t say 'Rine’, say 'Rain
'Thanks a lot, King,’ says I, in a manner well-

bred;

‘But all I want is 'enry 'iggins' 'ead!’
'Done,’ says the King, with a stroke.

’Guard, run and bring in the bloke!’

Then they ‘11 march you, 'enry 'iggins, to the
wall; I

And the King will tell me: 'Liza, sound the
call.’ के
As they raise their rifles higher,
I’ll shout: 'Ready! Aim! Fire!’
Oh ho ho! ’enry 'iggins!
Down you '11 go! ’enry 'iggins!
lust you wait!!!
