Uncle Sam is a mime act with almost no dialogue, except
for one or two words on a few occasions. It is a syrnbolical
drama of the exploitation of the poor and weak by the

rnannen
PART-1: A rich man is seen in a happy mood, dancing
merrily with a couple of his lackeys. A beggar comes and
begs for something to eat .The rich man gets hold of the
beggar, and binds him with screws in such a way that he
cannot told his right elbow and cannot use his left arm at
all. Then he gives him a peeled banana but the fellow
connot eat it becaue his arm is straight and he cannot
bend his elbow to eat. Then comes another beggar. and
he is also treated in the same manner. Now, as they

struggle with their bodies to try and eat the bananas, the
beggars come face to face with each other, and
suddenly they find a way to eat. They feed cach otherl.
At this the rich man gets angry. He calls one of them to a
side and whispers to him, “You have now become an

other beggar is also told the same thing. At this the
beggars become angry at each other and begin to fight.
