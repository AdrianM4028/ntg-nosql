Born on October 12 1981 as a Group Theatre, Khulna
Theatre has passed through many stages of evolution,
especially since the formation of its Research and
Cultural Development a: sociate named Lokenatya O
Sangskritik Unnayan Kendro (LOSAUK) in 1987. Never
resting on its Iaurels-and it has won many -and never
hesitating to try out new ideas and methods, Khulna
Theatre has now progressed to such an extent that it is
cOnsidered as one of the leading theatrical groups of
Bangladesh. Realising that Theatre is a very powerful
medium for conveying social and political messages to
the people, Khulna Theatre has successfully adapted
both Shakespeare's Hamlet, a foreign play of a bygone

age and such legends and folk—tales of Bangladesh like
Gazi Kaloo Charnpabati, Sukhi Rarnani Gunai Bibir
Kessa, Mahuar Pala etc, for the creation of modern
Bengali drama. In addition it has also created many
street-plays. and experimented with environmental
theatre, living theatre and many an other genre of
theatrical productivity. More important yet. it has
continued to create and develop a pool of talent by
means of continuous training through regular
workshops and seminars. From 1993 on, Khulna Theatre
.

has entered a new era as a Repertory Group.
