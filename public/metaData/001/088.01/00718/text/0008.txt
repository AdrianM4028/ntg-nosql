SONG BY MYSTIC POET-FAKIR LALON

SHAH (1808-1890)
Lalon Shah lived in the nineteenth century. He was born
in the district of Kushtia in southern Bangladesh, and
now lies buried in the same district. Although he was a
Mystic poet, almost all his songs are couched in the
language of human love. He is said to have written nearly

5,000 songs; and great poets like Rabindranath TagOre
and Nazrul lslarn have admitted that they were greatly .
influenced by both his poetry and philosophy. The song
now being presented has the same double feature of
being a mystic song while appearing to be a love song.
How long will it take me to meet,
The person living in my heart?
Every hour of the night I keep looking at the dark moon
Deciding-I shall become a slave under my beloved's feet
(Repeah
But the meeting doesn't take place-by the working of

fate,

(The first line of the song in refrain-twice)
As the lightning doesn't hide in the clouds,
My search is not hidden either,
As when (Radha) loses (her lover) Krishna ..... (Repeat)
(First line of song as retrain -twice)

When I remember that beauty, I have no tear or shame,
Lalon Fakir thinks and says always (repeat)
Every lover knows that fact as true (repeat)
Refra i n-twice .

The gourd, the sweet gourd,
Has made me an ascetic
I have eaten the top part of the gourd,
And eaten the bottom part too!
I have made a child's drum out of its shell
There 's so much honey in the gourd,
