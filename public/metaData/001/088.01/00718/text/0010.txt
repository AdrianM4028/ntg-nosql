son, but finds that he will never wake up again. She tries
in vain to awaken him, but he has gone to his eternal
sleep. In spite of the mother having to suffer so much to
find food for her child she could not save him. Her cry
echoes around the world, the cry of pain, the cry of

complaint-to society , and to God.
