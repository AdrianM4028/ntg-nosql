The literal meaning of the word “Karcha” is Narration or
commentary. But here it is used to mean a collage or
anthology of different forms of folk songs, folk dances,
customs and manners of different parts of Bangladesh.
Having a rich and varied cultural tradition spread over two ३
thousand years or more, it is impossible to present each
form even partially. As such. we have selected some of
the most popular elements of traditional Bangladeshi folk
culture and have used the costumes of different classes
and creeds living in different regions of the country. The
musical instruments used are also mostly indigenous.
in this compilation will be found suCh cultural elements as
Jatra, Halui, Panchai-jari, Gambhira, Arati and Kirtan. All
these elements of folk culture are still extant and thriving
in Bangladesh. Each element has its own special
characteristic and local flavour. All these cultural art forms
have developed over the centuries, from the life-.
experience of people of the country, starting with
salutations to all in the four directions-the Himalayas in
the north, the rising sun in the east, the ocean in the
south and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to the
west of Bangladesh.
