PA FIT-1 1 : The Fallen beggars are revived by the
sound of music-their own traditional, centuriesold folk
music ~ which is part of their own culture. The words of
the song' make them realise that we all belong to the

same planet, the same earth, the same land mass; she
feeds, clothes and nurtures us, all. When they are fully
revived the rich man appears again but this time invites
them to join him and lean his culture and lite-style. After
much hesitation, the beggars agree. They learn the rich
man's culture, his science and technolbgy (The walking
stick of the rich man represents all that the western world
has to give-science, technology and culture). The rich
man hands over the stick- representative of his means to
wealth and power-to the beggars, but they refuse to give
it back to him. lncessantly trying to get back what he had
given them, the rich man gets tired and falls down. But
the poor men are not as inhuman They have acquired
the rich man's Science, technology and culture, but they
have not abandoned their own culture 0 t

hurnanitarianisrn, of universal brotherhood, kindness
and co-operation; so they raise up the fallen rich man,
and they all dance happily.
This is a satirical song sung in the style of â€œBaul' songs, a
form of traditionl indigenous folk music of Bangladesh.

Song accompanying Folk-Dance: (21
Play the Dotara well today.
The beautiful Kamala is dancing
Seeing Kamala dance, oh dear!
The moon is smiling behind the orchard
So, play the dotara well today
The beautiful Kama/a is dancing
(instrumental music)

She sways while dancing , she swings while dancing (twice)
Herfeet do not touch the ground,
And even the sky comes down and dances (twice)
