A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A WORKING
WOMAN
(A MIME ACT WITHOUT ANY
DIALOGUE)
U N IT-1 . A rural woman, having been mistreated by her
husband, comes to the city with her little son and takes
shelter in a slum. For a livelihood, she turns to begging
from door to door. But fate is against her.
U N IT- 2 . - There has been nothing to eat for two days;
not even a morsel for the child. But how can the child
understand? He only cries as he gets hungry, and the
mother tries to calm him down in vain.
U N lT-3 . At last the woman goes in search of work. She
gets work of a kind - breaking stones with a hammer at a
building site. But being without any experience, she
hurts her thumb and has to leave that kind of work. Next
she gets work carrying mortar and concrete mixture.

Weakened by hunger, she repeatedly falls while
climbing the make-shift ladder, but she indomitably tries
and anyhow finishes the day. Now she has to stand in
line to get wages. At last, she gets the wages, but much
less than the proposed amount. Having no energy to
protest, she bemoans her fate and goes to market for
food.
U N lT-4. She arrives at her slum hut with the food, and
finds her child lying still. She thinks that the child might
have gone to sleep having become tired of crying. So
she goes to the fireplace and begins cooking at a frantic
pace.
