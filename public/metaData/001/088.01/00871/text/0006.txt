- THE HRE RAISERS has turned out to be something akin to
' world theatre, a kind of sneering Everyman version, a picture of

the frightened citizen, helpless in the fact of every kind of violence, even turning out to be its trailblazer.
Frisch's play can be traced back to an entry in his diary. In his
diary under the heading Burlesque, Frisch relates the fable of Bl—
EDERMANN in style somewhat reminiscent of Kafka's shorter
prose. It is certainly no coincidence that this entry follows another on the upheaval in Czechoslovakia where the bourgeois government actually paved the way for the "revolt". This burlesque
already refers to "Peace" as the one and only right that the citizen avails himself of.
