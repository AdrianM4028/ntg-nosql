THE FIRE RAISERS
In an "Essay on the limits of modern Drama", Joachim Kaiser
states that contemporary drama in particular cannot arise, "in
empty space or in a vacuum". There has to be a framework, a
part of the world that sets the limits within which the relationship between the characters in the play can develop. Kaiser calls
this common assumed factor "climate" and observes it above all
in the case of Frisch and Diirrenrnatt.

Although in both cases a furious anti-Swiss current of passion
rages, he says, their dramatic settings are Swiss to the core. Although Kaiser adduces Cullen, scene of action in "Besuch der Alten Dame (Di'menmatt) and "Andorra", the mini-state (in the play

of Frisch), what has been stated above is applicable to the FIRE
RAISERS, Frisch's first unqualified world success.

The play developed from the radio play MR. BlEDERMANN
AND THE FIRE RAISERS in 1957-58 and was first staged in
Ziirich under the direction of Oskar Walterlin in 1958, a long
with the farce DIE GROSSE WUT DES PHlLlPP HOTZ (The
Fury of Philipp Hotz).

The play was shown for the first time with its afterpiece on the
occasion of its first staging in Germany (Frankfurt)
