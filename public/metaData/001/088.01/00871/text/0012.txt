The play has indeed been interpreted on different levels in different parts of the world . In the former communist countries of
Eastern Europe, the "Fire Raisers " have been perceived as National Socialists, especially during Hitler's rise to power. Western
intellectuals have emphasized above all the relevance of the work
to the communists rise to power in Czechoslovakia in 1948 and
saw it as the "classical satire against communism ' particularly
against the methods of communist infiltration.
The parallels however, cannot be found in the personalities but

in the situation: the " takeover " by shrewd individuals who do
not disguise their real intentions.
Other symbols in the play have found different interpretations.
The petrol drums, for example, have been seen as weapons,
even as highly destructive nuclear bombs and their appearance
in the attic of Biedermann's house has been linked with the
threat of nuclear weapons appearing on West German soil in
the nineteen-fifties. In the early nineteen-eighties, they were
compared with intercontinental missiles introduced to Europe by
the U . S . A .

Mentioning of these three interpretations might suffice to point
out to audiences in other parts of the world the kind of comprehensive model that Max Frisch created with the "Fire Raisers".
The model pictures that mischief finds a ready welcome in the
so-called privacy of one's home, precisely because the citizen
wants to be left in peace here and therefore gives away this very
peace step by step.
