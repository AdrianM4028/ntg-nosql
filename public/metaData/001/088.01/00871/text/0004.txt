out the universally relevent questions of humanity, of ethics and
morality that are inherent in every society.

The very different ways in which his work has been interpreted
in different societies show that the interpretation is left to the

spectator and not forced on them by the dramatist.
I hope that the article being written in memorium about Max
Frisch, will provide useful information about him and his work to

the Sri Lankan audience and that the comment in summary also
allows the English speaking audience to enjoy the Sinhala version of the play.
The approach of the Sri Lankan translator and director Mr. Ravindra Ranasingha, who decided to come out with a version of

the play that is closer to a direct translation than an adaptation,
deserves the interest and support of the serious theatre going
public of Sri Lanka.
