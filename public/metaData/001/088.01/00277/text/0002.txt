STUDIO 1

Studio ред is a theatre group founded by

E. Alkazi,

l\/lanohar Singh,

Surekha Sikri, Uttara Baokar, Paddy Matthan, Nissar Allana and Amal
Allana, all of whom are personalities of a high repute in the field
of theatre.

This group aims to explore the ways

in which

other art forms

such as painting, sculpture, architecture, poetry, music and dance
are interlinked with theatre and how theatre can be inspired and
enriched by them.
This exploration can be expressed in ventures such as exhibitions
on theatre, creative theatre workshops, and play productions of
world masterpieces.
Through such explorations, an indigenous theatre form can be evolved
which is vibrant and meaningful to us today. The potential offered by
classical & traditional Indian Theatre are examined and translated
in the modern context, creating a unique theatrical form in which
is crystallized and accentuated through juxtaposing it
a reality
against stylization, for instance the spoken word abstracted through

music and choral sounds.
The group plans to perform regularly in theatre halls of the city,
universities and colleges. It also plans to travel with its productions.

The final aims of the group is to consolidate its activities; into a
small

institution, where regular courses

in the theatre arts will be

held, and other related activities expanded and regularised.
