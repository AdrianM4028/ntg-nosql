them. "Do not give up. Make kites. and be

ready for the next round". Kites fly again.

as unworthy of him. He pushes into service a
robot-kite, Which destroys all the kites except

belongs to them. . They are declared the
winners.

through the end.

soulless machine has replaced him. Tinda
boys ponder over their win in a contest in

' which they were not players.
