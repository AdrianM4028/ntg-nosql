At the production stage a “written text"
was prepared. This written text was however
not the final word as improvisations were

made even while the rehearsals were on.
Children were invtoved in each and every
aspect of the production of the play including
the script. DisCussions were held with them

and though they did not actually make the.
constumes themselves. the final costumes ' ' ’

are based on the ideas put forward by them. ’
Bal Bhavan Staff members improvised these
very ideas to make the costumes of the play
which proved to be a unique experience for .
them. The children also made a model set
themselves

The Director of the play Sh. Ashish Ghosh
was involved with the children frOm the very च्ि

beginning i.e. from the idea stage to the
inference stage. His expertise and dynamic;

guidance was a source of great inspiration '
and it motivated the children to think, write,
plan, design. set, music. etc. for the play
which resulted in the final output.
The workshop benefitted not only the
children but also the adults who were able to

get a lot of new ideas from them
