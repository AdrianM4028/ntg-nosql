Andersen’s ‘The Little Mermaid’ is a tragic story of
unattainable love unlike most other fairy tales with”
a happy-ever-after ending. The story is based upon
traditional folklore surrounding mermaids. While
mermaids are believed to have lived for over three
hundred years, they did not possess an immortal soul.
When the Little Mermaids falls in love with a mortal
Prince, she wishes to marry him. This is the only
means of acquiring a soul. Towards this end she
willingly sacriﬁces her beautiful voice, forsakes her
family and leaves her familiar world, only to ﬁnd that
she cannot win the affection of the Prince.

‘The Little Mermaid’ is Sutradhar Puppet Theatre’s
eighth production. It is done with string and rod
puppets.

HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN (1805-1875) was
born to poor parents in Odense, Denmark. At the age
of fourteen he left for Copenhagen to become an actor.
Having failed on the stage, he turned to writing. It is
here that his dramatic talents found their home. He
is most renowned and loved for his fairy tales, the
better known ones being ‘Thumbelina’, ‘The Snow
Queen’, ‘The Little Match Girl’, "I‘he Ugly Duckling’,
‘The Red Shoes’ and ‘The Little Mermaid’.

Producing almost one volume of stories each year, he
was recognised during his lifetime as Denmark’s greatest
storyteller. His fame was equally wideSpread in Europe,
England and America. His stories and fairy tales are
an integral part of world literature, appealing equally
to adults and children. A number of his stories are
based on personal experiences. For example, ‘The Little
Mermaid’ captures Andersen’s pain of unrequited love.
