ABOUT TH E PLAY
Children pick up habit of stealing at this age of 7â€”1 3 Actually this
is not stealing exactly it is basically ternpetations and few cornpleas (-ve or +ve)
which provke them to this. But if this problem is not dealt with utter delicacy and

care, this could lead to disastrous situation. Children in our play have better
suggestions to deal with this problem. Lets us lend our senses to them.
Thanks!
