Dear Shri Pankaj Saxena,
We thank you for your letter of October 28, 1996.

We are very happy to know that the National School of

Drama is organising another Children's Theatre Festival in
November this year.
That over one hundred children aged only between 7 and

1 5 years of age can actually mount four plays is indeed heartening to learn. in these days of stressful living and keen
cornpetitveness at the school level, drama or theatrical activity
indeed plays a vastly therapeutic role in providing children an
important emotional release. We are sure this festival will be a
success. Both, participating children and the children among the
spectators are bound to gain from the experience. We wish your
endeavour all success this year and in years to come.
With best wishes,

Your sincerely

sd/—
