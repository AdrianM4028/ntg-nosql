ऐन वसंतात, अष्टर्या रावी
(A MlDSUMMER—NIGHT’S DREAM)
There is no need for the performer to
supply a reason for doing A Midsummer-night’s
Dream—it is merely an attempt at theatrical
d e I ig ht .
But after so many centuries of Shakespeare
and amidst so many interpretations of the play,
it might be relevant to stress that this production
tries to capture the innocence of the original——
nothing else.
Some may see the play rather as a nightmare
than a dream; it may be for them a play of
power, lust and violence. In this respect. this
production does not wish to be avant—garde !
The lndianisation of the play is in a way a
step towards universalisation, rather than localisation. The idyllic quality of the play is highlighted
by the pastiche—like costume—design and fairy—
tale—like decor.
Music and dance are important aspects—they
are the main theatric devices that achieve this
‘magic’. An important thing to note in this
respect : poems by Baalkavi are used in the play.
This famous Marathi poet wrote extremely
powerful poetry—both of gloom and of joy. His
words immediately evoke the imagery of
Shakespeare’s original play. The affinity is
astonishing.

The play is about love. equality and
compassion. The play is about oneness with
nature. The play is about compromise. The play
surely is about values that we should remind
ourselves of.

The play is Shakespeare’s ode to joy ! We
are trying to sing this universal song in our
own mother—tongue.

It is for you to judge this attempt.
