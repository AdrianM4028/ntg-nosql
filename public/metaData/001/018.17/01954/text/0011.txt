I am pleased to know that Sh. C. S. Sindra is taking keen interest to celebrate the

golden jubilee of â€™Light Er Sound

Prograrnme' entitled "MARAD AGAMRA"

I happen to be a member of the committee which scrutinised the script of this

famous Light and Sound Programme which high lights the life and philosophy of the Tenth
Guru Gobind Singh ji, thousands of Hindus and Muslims were whose followers.
The Guru's father, mother, sons and disciples gave their lives for the cause of Human
Brotherhood and Fatherhood of God, when the hatred of religious basis had spoiled the

social. political and religious life in India.
Its dedication to creation of KHALSA PANTH'S event is a anique idea.
This Light and Sound Programme will certainly inseminate Guru's message of Love
and Tolerance which is the need of the universe now a days.
I wish all success to Shri Sindra's efforts.
