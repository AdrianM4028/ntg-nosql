Punjabi NataK Academy has done a commendable job in presenting
this play which was inaugurated by 8. Beam Singh, Chief Minister
Punjab on 17th July, 1992. I hope Punjabi Natak Academy would

come out with more meaningful plays especially on the teachings Er
preachings of the Gurus not only for India but also for other parts of

the world.
