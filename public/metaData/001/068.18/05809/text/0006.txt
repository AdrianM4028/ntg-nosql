While everyone is busy tending to the wounded boy, the Major has a vision of an imaginary court in which he stands accused of attempted manslaughter. He defends himself thus :“Judge me, your honour. They have held me for having afflicted grievous injury on a
person. But as I stand in the dock I remember one of the sayings of Deshbandhu Chittaranjan : if love of country be a crime, then I am a criminal. I would say, too, that if
love of one’s motherland be a crime, that if it is an offence to punish a traitor, then I am
guilty. I would gladly welcome any punishment that may be inflicted on me, for I know I
shall be able to bear the burden of it, however heavy it may be. But how my conscience

is punishing me is unbearable Believe me, sir, my conscience keeps on telling me every
moment that I am guilty—that I should have killed the traitor outright, But this I failed
to do. I was weakened by a father’s affection even when I knew he was a traitor and
deliberately shot him in the leg. My affection had blinded me to the stark truth that the
motherland comes first, before the child. I am on trial at the court of my conscience. I
plead guilty, sir. and await trial at your hands. Punish me— in such a manner that we
may become true soldiers of the country !”
