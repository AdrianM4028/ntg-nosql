to the nation while Arindam argues that the story of aggression is a mere concoction. Meanwhile Mr. and Mrs. Halder go about organising the neighbourhood for national defence aid.
The Major goodhumouredly agrees to lend his support to the scheme.

The sudden arrival of Prativa and Mrinal, daughter and son of Major Sen’s friend Naren
who has been killed by enemy action on the Assam border, introduces a grim element into
Major Sen’s apparisal of the situation . He isjolted into a recognition of the realities. Prativa’s terrible experience has somewhat unbalanced her mind and Major Sen receives the two in
his home and arranges to look after their welfare.
Meanwhile the anti-social group of which Prabir, Arindam and Sobhana are members goes
about its unpatriotic and traitorous activities. The testimony of Prativa’s condition, however,
works a change in Arindam’s outlook; he sees the group in its true colours and as he does not

hide his disillusionment and disgust he is assassinated. Unaware of Prabir’s secret sympathies
and activities, Major Sen hopes that his son would some time marry Prativa.
The crisis comes when Prabir is ordered by his party to leave quietly for a certain destination with important Secret documents. His father, who has had suspicions about Arindam’s
late afﬁliations, chances to discover Prabir in the act of surreptitiously leaving home. The true
nature of his son’s activities and Sympathies now dawns on him and he squarely confronts the
youngman. Prabir. however, is desperate; and as a last resort the Major shoots him in the leg
and incapacitate 5 him.
