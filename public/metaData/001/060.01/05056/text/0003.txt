1975, Uttar Pradesh Assembly incident in 1997, continued to the Democratic Practice in
Parliament (Hooliganism) till date, the Ram Mandir - Babri Masjid incident in 1992, the post

Godhra, Irom Sharmila for her fast of 11 long years against 'Armed Forces Special Powers
Act' (AFSPA) in Manipur, the current Global situation etc. I have not restricted myself on the
historical facts and features or its architectures, styles, motifs, draperies or hair styles -

instead, I have tried to maintain the classic elegance of an age- old era through music and
creative design.
I find that while a particular system of 'state—power' is evolved in a political system — be that

freedom of expression is inevitably

Democracy or Autocracy - freedom of thought &

sacrificed first! That is the premise of the play. For me, Socrates is merely a source of
historical introspection but an allegory, a living metaphor: It's a retelling history to the

present context. Down the centuries all attempts of thwarting this freedom of thought &
freedom of expression had been going rampant.

The freedom of thought & freedom of

expression should be sustained at all cost. But all such efforts of curbing it should be met
with challenge and resistance. I am sure you will agree with me that, the world has not

changed much since the time ofSocrates some time two thousand five hundred years ago!

As mark of our heartfelt 'Tribute' 'this production is dedicated to the fond memory of
Mr. Jayanta Das, a brilliant Stage & Film Actor of our time.

Thankyou.
