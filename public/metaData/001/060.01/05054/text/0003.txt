of the most striking event of our country in recent times, the organization wishes to present

lnstigated by the genocide, hatched a decade ago in the social political scenario of India which

shattered the very fiber of the entire Social and Democratic norms of any civilized society.
Seventeenth July transforms the theme to an Indian setting. Firstly, the conflict between the
followers of two religions. Secondly, it condemns of religious fascism and politicalisation beliefs,
challenges the insanity practiced in the name of religion, intentionally designed to vibrate the
roots of humanity in India. Thirdly, to introspect the very mind set, the disease of communal
hatred which binds us like a Python, (the central image or metaphor of this production) primarily
lies in our mind not in its manifestation. That comes later. The sense of toleration is in stake,
diminished! Therefore, today the time has come to introspect and asses this sinister that, how
long it would continue for the politically vested interest and how long we allow to happen this

menace time and again.

The purpose of this production is to generate the sense of tolerance & sense of togetherness,
social & political awareness, communal harmony in the cross section of people towards the
National Integration.
