well as the certainty of mass radioactive death, the discontent man, caught in the

perpetual paradoxes, was to be a recurrent theme in his poetry.
Muktibodh, who is today considered a bridge between the Progressive movement

in Hindi poetry and the Nayi Kavila (Modern Poetry) movement died an abysmal
death in September 1964.

Mukti is based on two poems by Muktibodh -Andl1ere mein and Bhoolgalti, written
more than 50 years ago. Having acquired Independence in 1947 as a nation, we
were to unravel the truer connotations of 'independence‘ and gauge its value. Sadly,
we let it be trampled by oppressive forces and opened the gates to a future where the
vicarious and petty yardsticks of 'success' dictated the course of a person's life. This

Ma paw/1’4 Nola:
The sensitive mind is the most vulnerable. The virtues are under threat. The
disintegrating forces have resorted to conspiracy and nudity. Vulgarity is the order
of the day. The entire society is plagued with a collective moral downfall. The
definition of ‘modernity' has undergone an unfortunate shift wherein passivity
seems to be the primary clause for being modern. 'Success' has been reduced to
petty yardsticks of glowing skins, swanky cars and fat pay—cheques. 'Thoughts and
