W0H AB BH l PU KARTA HAI
Presentation - Act One

Life goes on. ltjust doesn't look back in anger. Past is not history, but
an enigma. Culture is not a way of life. It's a forum of forms, styles &
traditions. And there you are!!!
Exploring the means to confront the contemporary reality with a
historical perpective. Casteless socity?-is it merely an intellectual

debate or do we have a proper insight?
“Woh Ab Pukarta Hai" is Piyush Mishra's maiden attempt to create an

original script. James Baldwin's “Blues For Mister Charlie" was inspiring enough to take the plunge. Yet the question remains.
