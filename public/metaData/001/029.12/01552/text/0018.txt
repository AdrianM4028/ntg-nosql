SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION
by john Guare
Presentation - Yatrik

“Six Degress of Separation" has been an unusual play to direct
in
many ways. The winner of the New York Drama Critics Circle Prize
for
the Best Play of 1990-91 and London's Olivier Award for Best Play of

1993, John Guare has written a powerful, evocative, at timesfunny,
at times searing drama. The title “Six Degrees of Separation" comes
from an idea that everyone on this planet is separated from everyone
else by only six other people.

A double-sided painting by Kandinsky, which hangs over the stage,
is an emblem of the metaphor of the play, defining schizophrenia as
what is inside the psyche and which “doesn't match up with what's
out there”. The relevance of the play lies in our awareness of the
divisions that exist-social, familial, cultural-in our societies today, and
the need to investigate the many degrees of separation that prevent
people from knowing one another and from knowing themselves. As
Paul the young con man says, it is the imagination that can open us

up to introspection and salvation, but the death of the imagination
is one of the great tragedies of our times. The critic Clive Barnes writes
that the play is “uplifting, puzzling, yet surely telling us something
about ourselves we hardly knew and only dimly perceived".
Guare uses unusual conventions. The actors speak directly to the
audience, entrances and exists just happen, the unities of time and

place vary. The play lends itself to an informal, intimate presentation,
with a highly suggestive set, the different levels representing a
wealthy New York apartment, a bedroom, a computer room at MIT,
a consulting room at a New York hospital. The actors sit in the
audience, the lights help to establish the locale and the atmosphere,
the music is used to heighten the experience. The rest we leave to
your imagination!
