DIRECTORS NOTE

When I first read this play "Desire Caught By The Tail"; I was
entrapped

a

by

few

words

and

from

—

images

to

words

Irrationality, Scepticiwn Grotesque, World War,
Bourgecisie,
Love, Irony, Cynicism, Contradiction, HelplessCold,
Hunger,
ness, Factories, Industries, Advertisements, and finally Cry

and Whisper.

These are much known and most disturbing words. I am fasinated
by the way Picasso 'has captured. these words into e1 poetic
collage. And I thoroughly enjOyed during this play.

Violently broken and disfigured between two World Wars of
Europe, Big Foot vivaciously confesses his own subjective sins
as against the rnodern bourgeois conventions, repression .and
desirousness as well as incest. He stands along with Bekett's

"Vladimir", for
