Pablo Picasso was an epoch in the world of Art. His play is a
painting, in words. As a person and as an actor, I identify
myself with this play. We have to again look for our roots, we

have to stop tï¬‚mml frmn withering. So we can keep alive the
innocence which is within us. And so step by step we can go
ahead, with a sense of morality born from our human values.

This play written in 1941 leads the way to the present like a
rope balancing acrobat, on the ropes tied to the poles of the
history and the future.

Intead of collecting a few coins in the plate, the co-artiste's
of this acrobat are searching for colours and meaningful values
in a pallete-like plate.
