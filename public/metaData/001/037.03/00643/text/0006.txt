Whether or not this play may be 8 success - "Havas Ki Phansi
Poonch" has been a memorable experience; for it gave me an
insight into abstract theatre; Picasso - his work and life and
also the ups and downs of working together. I feel it is an
experimental play where Theatre and Art have been given equal
importance.

It took me days to somewhat understand the play, and it will
not surprise me if the audience comes out of the auditorium,

wondering what hit them.

Being a student of Art I feel very proud to be a part of this

play, written by Picasso.
I think his way of writing is very closely connected to his way

of painting. I would call his paintings "a drama on canvas".

This play portrays 8 fantasy beyond reach) of, undesirable
anguish; a de-metamorphosis of self-pity and sorrow.

Scepticism, doubt ...........
My mother, brother, father, friends,
I doubt you, and I doubt myself to be with you all.
Those days ..........

When I tried to say something to you all,
Something which is absolute . .........
Love
so?
But what is that, which is not allowing me to say
I really wonder, whose fault, it is?

It is 'nobody' or is it 'somebody'?
I thought I would no longer think in that manner,

I thought I would only 'love' you all.
But .......... I doubt.
