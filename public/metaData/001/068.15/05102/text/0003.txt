THE THEME
“SHISHU TIR'I‘HA”
. The theme poses the eternal query: “What is the hour of the
night”? The question has a cosmic import, which sees the cavalcade of
human civilisation through the ages, moving slowly but surely towords

the goal of peace. truth and non-violence.
The procession that unfolds itself comprises a cross-section of‘vall' '
humanity. There are divided camps. there are clashes and confronta-

tions, but the surging mass moves inexorably on towords its cherished
goaL
“The elemental brute is eternal and
८ goodnessin its depth is darkly

conning 1n deception”, say the people.
The leader leads the people on. no matter What the hurdles, to the
avowed goal-the universal temple of humanity-where truth, love and
universal brotherhood abound.

During the advance, one of the co-travellers gets frenzied and kills
the leader, leading to complete chaos. But soon the Old Man of the
East raises his voice: ‘The martyr will show us the path and lead us to
the goal of new life’.
“We ref'used him in doubt, we killed him in anger”, now we shall
accept him in love”.

So they move on, to the pilgrimage of fulﬁlment-to the ultimate

destination,-the dawn of the new Born Life, the “Tirtha”.

The Substance of“ the Poem
What is the hour of the Night ?
A cosmic query-an eternal questi 11 facing the man.
Nobody knows the answer. ३
The path is strewn with obstruction
No way out of this chaos
५
Darkness and despair prevailing every where.
Men com out in the" eternal qUest
_
Of light, Peace and Happiness.
They are just like torn pages of History
VIoving helter skelter like dry leaves wafted by wind.
There is chaos, misunderstandings and violence है .
the seer - the Pathﬁnder appears
And preaches the me‘ssageol‘ Humanism.

Still doubt and hesitation prevade the .mind of the people
