The Leader leads them on the path
Of eternal Peace and Light.
They start out in a procession
They f'atal humanity in the quest of new life
The way is along and full of danger.
The huge procession of humanity reaches a peak.
They take rest under a banyan tree
५ Completely fagged out af sheer exhaustion
In a ﬁt of madness a fanatic
Betrays the Leader and murders him

The people gather round the dead body of the
Great martyr in mourning.

ThereIS tragic stillness.

Among the processionists there1s a wise old man of the East,
He rises, asks the people to shed their violence & despair
And guides the peOple

on the their last cap of struggle and expedition
He says: the spirit of the great martyr W111 lead us
on to the gaol of the New Life.

Ultimately their pilgrimage comes to an end
When they reach a temple where
Ihe Divine Mother18 sitting with A new born child on her lap

The child is the new born age the New Life.
They all how to the mother

And all join in a hymn by praise of
The New Born child the Divine MOther

and the great martyr.

The divine hymn of humanity
Reverberates through the Universe
Declarating the victory of New Born Man

MAHA MANAV ASHEY‘
