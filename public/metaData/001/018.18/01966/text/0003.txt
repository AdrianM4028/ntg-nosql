I have sought inspiration from the ballad singers. in my productions the art of actor is hidden in these balladeers who ernotionalize
and charge the listeners with a graphic protrayal of characters and
events, etching out the scenes with gestures and facial expression, ran-

ging from the subdued tones to the terrifying. Ballads have tremendous potential for dramtisation. l have made use of the folk legends,
language, rituals, songs and dances in my plays. To my mind, this
kind of traditional theatre represents the panorama of our existence,
culture and heritage.
The play is based on a script written by Balwant Gargi l have
added excerpts from the Quissas of Hashem. Fazal Shah and Sada Ram

The stage representation of an epic like this

needed a set

which could use various levels and interesting space relationships to

accomodate fierce action, ritualistic dances, stylised movements and
ceremonials. Designer Mahendra has designed a set that gives me
the impression of waves, of an undulating river. The zig-zag movement
of line gives a feeling of a sad python devouring Sohni. A deep
sense of tragedy horror and pain. Also the lines are drawn from life
thus lifting it to a metaphysical level.
