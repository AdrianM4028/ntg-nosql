irrelevant in threatre. While in cinema the fundamental
thing is the image, in theatre it is the word. It is the
constancy of words that is the basic characteristic of
threatre and the visual is the agency through which this
constancy is realized.
Maharishi. The nature of the visual in theatre is different
from the nature of the visual in cinema. In the theatre the
vrsual essentially means the living actor. On the other
hand, cinema has a tremendous capacity for animating
inanimate objects. In some cases no living being ever
appears on the screen, yet the film provides an intense
human experience, while I have never heard of a stage
performance without an actor. Therefore the conclusions
based on the comparison of the visual as in theatre and
as In cinema may be misleading. The actor is important
in theatre.
Rakesh. Let us not confuse the issues. It will be wrong
to think that my investigation is directed against the
actor. If my thinking is in any way interpreted as a negation of the actor‘s role in theatre, it would be entirely a
misjudgement. In the sort of theatre I have in mind the
actor will retain all his present importance and acquire
some more, although he may be called upon to assume a
responsibility different from what he is supposed to discharge now. I have a strong feeling that the actor needs

dom of his own expression and this freedom will have to
be restored to him. I look upon the experiments like
Happenings as a revolt of the performer against the rigidity imposed on him by the conventional theatre. This
rigidity has to go.

Maharishi. Rejection of the conventional implies that the
actor will have to seek something new. Do you think that
to be able to put across your plays to the audience the
actor will have to undergo a different kind of training and

how do you think he will achieve this ’liberation“ .7
Rakesh The word and the sound should have the power
to charge the actor and consequently liberate him. It
happens in our folk plays. I feel one can draw a lot from
the directness of approach of some of our folk forms.
The actor there appears released. I think a good play of
today should be able to give the same feeling of release
and personal realization which a folk actor abundantly
has. It seems quite ridiculous to me today to give those
specific stage directions like 'he moves to the curtain on
the window, up left on the stage, which has yellow
stripes'. No, I think the actor has to be led to a zone of
of
awareness where he feels free to follow the dictates
