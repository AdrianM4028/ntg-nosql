MOLIERE'S “TARTUF‘FE‘i was first performed for Louis'XlV in 1664, the ३ play offended the pious and was banned, as was the second version produc- '

0

ed in 1667. ln.1669 the third version of the play was authorised. Orgon, a
. Parisian bourgeois, forces his family to accept the presence of the pious Tartuffe.
Moreover, he wants Tartuffe to marry his daughter Mariane. But Tartuffe, who
is in‘ fact a sensual parasite, is attracted to Elmire, Orgon's wife.
finally realizes that Tartuffe is trying to seduce

Wh‘i‘an Orgon

his wife, he wants to drive him

out. But Orgon has already made over the whole of his estate to Tartuffe and
has entrusted him with compromising political papers. Tartuffe would have had '
Orgon turned out of his own house and arrested if the king had not discovered
just in time, that Tartuffe was a dangerous criminal. In the end it is he who is
arrested.

Tartuffe is based on the relationship between two men, one of whom is

ready to sacrifice blindly his family to the religious ideal embodied by the other,
that other being a hypocrite who tricks him and makes game of him. Thus, not
only hypocrisy but an excess. of sincere piety are made the objects of satire and है
comic effects.
