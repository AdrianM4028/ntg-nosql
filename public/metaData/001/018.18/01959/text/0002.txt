“If the purpose of comedy be to chastise human weaknesses l see no
reason why any class of people should be exempt. This particular failing is one

of the most damaging of all in its public consequences and we have seen that
the theatre is a great medium of correction.

The finest passages of a serious

moral treatise are all too often less effective than those of a satire and for the
majority of people there is no better form of reproof than depicting their faults
to them : the most effective way of attacking Woe is to expose it to public
ridicule.

People can put up with rebukes but they cannot bear being laughed at:

they are prepared to be wicked but they dislike appearing ridiculous."
