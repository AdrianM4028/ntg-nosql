The Department of Indian Theatre,
constantly

Stri'Ving to be in the

main stream

of

contemporary

Indian Theatre has chooserf- to do
‘Mattavilasam,
7th
century
‘Prahasan’, by Maharaja Mahendra
Vikrama, precisely to underline the

point that the wealth of our ﬁftradition needs to- be explored and

properly understood in depth if
r the true synthesis of the? Modern

and Traditional theatre is to be
achieved. It is not possible to under
stand the tradition ifl-oUr actors
and directors are untrained and
unskilled. Singing, dancing are

integral part of

our traditional

theatre and therefore demand in-

tensive training.Director, Kurnara Varmal and his
team has worked extremely hard
and it is now for the audience to
judge and evaluate their work.

It is my duty tothank Mrs.‘ Anjala
Maharishi and _ Mr.R. Padmanabhan

who

have

provided

us

with

valuable help in training our actors
in dance and music.
