“Kanak di Balli” was inspired छाल folk song in which a beautiful girl is compared to an ear of corn and
how she is gobbled up.

Two things have always made me sad - the destruction of beauty and the death

of a creative mind. I n my village I saw many beautiful girls destroyed by lust for possession. Also the
sense of heredity haunted me. I n the writing of this play I used poetic speech and mixed it with crude
language and songs. This juxtaposition of beauty and ugliness, tenderness and barbarity, selfishness
and idealness, and mud and milk are for calculated effect.

The play was first staged by Delhi Art Theatre in 1957. Later Gursharan Singh of Amritsar staged it in
Punjab villages, and Harpal Tiwana in Patiala, Bombay and even in Canada. I did its production at the
University of Washington in Seattle in 1966 using a round platform in the arena stage with no sets.
Last year the play was staged in Bombay by Balraj Sahni who played the lecherous landlord. With his
burning idealism to end landlordism, he made the forest guard kill the landlord thus changing the end of
the play. But I do not want to mitigate the effect of the tragedy by such retribution. l have allowed
the landlord to continue thereby making the audience think about the persistent presence of vulgarity
and possession which the character of Maghar symbolises.
