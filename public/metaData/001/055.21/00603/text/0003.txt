r \HE Bharatiya Kala Kendra is one of the many cultur
organisations
that came into being during the post independence period. It was
registered in 1952. The Kendra had a modest beginning and in its early
period of development was interested only in organizing music festivals and
other shows—the main emphasis being on entertainment. Subsequently, it
realized that there were higher objectives worth striving for and efforts
were made to make it a symbol of the great forces of cultural resurgence
that were released by the impact of independence. The organizers had
the twofold aim of redeeming art from the utter neglect and decadence
into which it had fallen, and of adapting it to present-day requirements.

On the one hand the traditional and classical values had to be preserved;
on the other hand, art had to be infused with a new spirit and made a
vehicle of creative thought and expression.
Accordingly, the Kendra established the College of Music है, Dance

in the year 1952 and deﬁned its policy about the teaching and practising
of these Arts.

In pursuance of this policy, the K en d r a succeeded in

Ustad Wahid Khan and Shri Birju Maharaj, all distinguished exponents of

their respective arts. They are two well known to need an introduction.
The Kendra also runs preparatory classes for imparting training in
dancing and vocal music to screen young talents for the beneﬁt of higher
training. These are incharge, reSpectively, of two instructors—Kumari Maya
Rao, M. A., and Nasir Zahiruddin Dagar. Besides, the Kendra has on its

permanent staff a number of “accompanying” artistes for Tabla, Sarangi,
Pak h a waj etc.
In starting this College, the main object of the K e n d r a was to

provide the students with an opportunity to learn from the masters themselves in an atmosphere of academic discipline. This was a very diﬂicult task,
but the Bharatiya Kala Kendra is very fortunate in having Rani Ripjit Singh
as the administrator of College of Music & Dance who has very ably handled
it.

She is not only a good administrator, but she is also a very good well-

known “a rt is te.
