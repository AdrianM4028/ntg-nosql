drama has a unique place. It embraces all the arts - Sculpture.
Architecture. Literature. Dance. Music and Painting in its fold.
From a beggar to a king. rniser to philanthropist. a sinner to saint
and a kid to grandpa. it has always something to give - be it
contentment. a lesson. an impetous or a short lived mirth. To
manifest all this. a group of artistes have to turmoil hard and
undergo an ardous ordeal to produce a play that caters for the taste

of each audience

The Seven Stars New Delhi has stridden ahead in the field of promotion of drama.
Year after year. the team of this association working under one spirit of unanimity. has
added zest and service to enrich the art of drama. The acclamation granted by the
public and the patrons of association that this unit is the best in the production of
Punjabi plays. has thrown us a challenge to grow up to their expectations.
The association is again presenting before you repeat performances of ‘CHHA M MAKCHHALLO’. a hilarious comedy written by Shri Arnrit Kashyap which has been adapted

in Punjabi and Directed by Meena Kapur
