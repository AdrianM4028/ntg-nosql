Celibacy is the virtuous quality" that is most revered of a
youth but it turns into a vicious .si-n when he is out for
renting a house. All the land lords have only one condition
before they rent out their appartrnent—Have you a wife?
No wonder, Parkash had to act indgeniously by dressing
his bossorn friend, Bhusan as a Lady to present him as
his wife to aquire a rented accommodation. All done in
good faith but a chain of unexpected incidents created
such complications which almost wrecked the castles of

his future happiness.
