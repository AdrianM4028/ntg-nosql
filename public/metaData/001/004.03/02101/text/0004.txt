Dear Sir,
I am glad to know that you are having a Workshop on the
Theatre at Allahabad from December 22, 1972 to January 13,

1973. Though I have been of the VICW that in recent years
there has been an excess of conferences, seminars and wamkshops‘
on the theatre, I have noted tlmt your Institution is not merely.
devoted to academic activities but that it has staged ninety plays
in various towns of Uttar Pradesh and other States. I am,
therefore, hopeful that your seminar would be of. a more practi
cal kind of self-training programme than just lectures.

I wish every success in third drama workshop of Rangshilpi.

Your, fai thfu1 l ya
