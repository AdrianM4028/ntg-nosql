The place

I come from is all

Western u Culturewise and

living style too :
my forefather had a culture rooted in Indian soil —
most ~ probably the kind of_atmosphene Mohan Rakesh's
VAshad Ka Bk Din“. Naturally my feeling of having been
upmrooted from my own soil provides me enough.tragic

to read Kalidasa's plight as a poet drawn away from
Village by the royal courterey.
Village stands in two ways for me. No hyprocracy
(क्राहुँनुएस्तागुक्ष No killing (Kalidas vrs Dantal confrontation);

Modern man in whatever ways civic he may be u but
he is strangly animal towards female folk - the concept
of

it even i

But I become very happy that Vilom and Kalidas
have their antagonism not to the distorted image of

Mallika, but for the idealisation of Mallika.
I learnt what is called humility — that is
called Mohan Rakesh's Mallika. my doing of the play

"Ashad Ka Ek Din" is this, whatever we the posterity
are more modern or the‘predecesSors were ?
