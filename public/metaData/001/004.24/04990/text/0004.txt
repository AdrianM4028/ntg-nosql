Like the millions of our village folk Rahim—m simple

and God-fearing peasant

living in afar oﬁ“ village in North Bengal aspired to have a happy home with
Phuljan,

his young wife and Bashir, his only little son,
and extreme

poverty.

he was

very bold

Struggling hard against
in exposing

the fowl

Hakimuddin, the village moneylender-cum-Zamindar, who had, by his

various

play of

odds

cunning

tricks and mani-

pulations. grabbed the peasant’s land including that of Rahim’s father and brought
disasters on them. By degrees, therefore, Rahim, who was popular enough in the village
became Hakimuddin’s greatest enemy, He tried to implicate Rahim in a case of
dacoity
organised by him, but the latter managed to foil it and Hakirnuddin got a narrow escape
and was furious.

And then came the World War II. Hoarding and Black-marketing started on an
unprecedentied scale. The great man-made famine cast its dark shadow on the
little village as it did in other parts of Bengal.
The ﬁelds were green but there Was
nothing with the poor to live upon. It was still two months before the crop could be
ready for harvest. Starvation started. People died likeflies. Some sold their wives and
daughters and some left them to destitution. Millions of families were uprooted.
But this meant the most golden period for Hakimuddin, who utilised the opportunity to punish Rahim, whose mother died of starvation and the entire family was going
without food. But Rahim was a man of ideals and his sense of prestige was so high

that he could even welcome death

rather than go to Hakimuddin for some food and thus

accept moral defeat.

Organised by Rahim, the villagers went to the magistrate for starting a free kitchen
in the village, which was sanctioned. But here again ~Hak1mudd1n played a trick. He
utilised it as a source of proﬁt and managed to have it in his own house. Thus the free
kitchen, also could be of no help to Rahim, as he refused hated to go to Hakimuddin’s

house.
