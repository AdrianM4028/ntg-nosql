_ The Three Arts Club can be justiﬁably proud of its active and creative
career of 25 years. It has an uninterrupted career of devoted service to the cause of

the theatre.

The fact of its having given 400 shows during this period is most

commendable.

A very

pleasing and heartening feature of this activity has been its

achievement in putting on board a large number, over 30 original plays, many of
which proved very successful.

In these days were so many groups take the easy and

facile way of lifting and adapting foreign plays, the determination and achievement
of the Three Arts Club in upholding the need for original plays in praise worthy and

must be heartin congratulated.

It is also one of the very few groups that prepared special plays for child
audiences.

lndian theatre has still not caught up on the realisation that the V

Children’s Theatre also means adults playing for children in special dramas written
for children.

I am very glad to give my sincerest good wishes and warmest greetings to
the Three Arts Club on the happy occasion of its Silver Jubilee.
