ma!

Dear M r. K a u I ,
I am glad to receive your letter of 17th January and to know that
the Three Arts Club is celebrating its Silver Jubilee in February
I am, very intimately familiar with the work

of

Three Arts

Club and

growing during the last two decades of my own association
with theatre in Delhi. l have always been impressed by the dynamic initiative
I

have seen

it

displayed by the Three Arts Club in building up theatre movement in Delhi,
Three

Arts

Club

is one

of the

few

theatre

groups

which

has

its

own large appreciative audience; and Cultivating new audience for theatre in
my view, is the most signiﬁcant contribution that the Three Arts Club ,has
m ade .

I send my good wishes on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee
brations of the Three Arts Club and for its very bright future.

W it h k i n d regards.
Yours sincerely.

SHRI R. M. KAUL,
