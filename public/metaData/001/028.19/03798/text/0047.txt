For a theatre organisation to celebrate its
Silver Anniversary is something in.the nature of a
miracle, particularly when that organisation has
subsisted entirely through its own efforts in the

face of overwhelming odds.
The Three Arts Club has done excellent pioneering
work in what was for many years a cultural wilderness.

It has presented original plays of considerable skill_
and social significance; its productions are technically
skillful, with great vivacity and Verve. It has over the
years helped to develOp an extensive

theatre-minded

audience. it has taken theatre to many remote parts of the
country.
For all this, it deserves the gratitude, respect and
admiration of those who have wished to see theatre play a

meaningful role in society.
