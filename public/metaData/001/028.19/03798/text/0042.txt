February 3, 1968.

The Three Arts Club deserves congratulations for completing
25 years of its uninterrupted theatrical activity.

These who know
the many difficulties that come in the way of professional or non_

professional dramatics can appreciate the significanca of this
occasion.

The competition with the glanourised cinema,

the dearth

of preper auditoria. the difficulty of getting together the roquisit.

talent for the actors and actors, the paucity of good plays in our

5

languages, and above all else the indifference of our audiences

(even educated. cultured and sophisticated classes) to drag; in
general and Hindustani plays in particular -- these are some of
thc hurdles that the Three Arts Club has heroically and successfully
negotiated.

Thus it use not only survived but helped to revive and

rejuvenate Hindustani theatre for which it deserves the thanks of 311
theatre-lovers in the country.

On this happy and auspicious ecoaelon,

I send my greetings and

good vishes to the Three Arts Club and to its renowned playwright,

director

and actor Mr. ROE-SSE MEH'I‘A.
