Dear Shri Kaul,

Thanks for your letter of the 19th instant and was glad ‘to' know
that the Three Arts Club is celebrating its Silver Jubilee, To

maintain an amateur dramatic troupe in a flourishing conditiori is by
no means a small achievement in lndian Theatre activities.

For two

years (1954 - 1956) I had occasion to know the club more intimately.

But

going

over

the

‘High

Lights’

of your achievement i feel my

knowledge was too intimate to make me realise some great {things
achieved by you - not only in the number of productions दुआएँ in
their quality and importance vis - a - vis Indian Theatre movement.
I wish the club still greater achievements and a wider world हूँगा its
activities.

'

My best wishes to you and to all the members some
may be knowing since 1954.

of

whom

i

Yours sincerly
Sdf- Adya Rangacharya
