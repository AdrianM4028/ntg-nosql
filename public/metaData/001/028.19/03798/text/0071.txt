“yes that to believe in some people being touchoblcs and some
untouchables is mt

religion but the reverse"
Mahatma Gandhi
Untouchability is a curse.
here is no doubt that it should be eradicated.
In fact, apart from leaders to public opinion, the so-called “high castes" have also
come to realise that untouchability must go if peace, harmony and love are to be the
order of the day. But what after untouchability ? Will mere opening of temples and
schools and provision of constitutional safeguards and guarantees really bring about
the casteless society and class-less love between people ? And then what about the
reaction of education, equality and fraternity on the erstwhile under-privileged castes.
All these are questions which one has ultimately to face. But will we
succeed in facing these questions ?
There is no doubt that we will succeed.
Yes, we will succed but success will come through experience, by swiming
over the currents and cross currents of social adjustments, social conscience, so that
in the process many homes may be ruined, much misunderstandings crea है , many
a loving heart broken before castless love among people becomes a reali . before

the only true call-the call of loving hearts could bring men and women togetlier to lay
the foundations of a society based only on equality and love.
