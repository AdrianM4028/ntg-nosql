ANAMI KA
Anamika was founded in December, 1955 and since then it has been working
in the fields of drama, literature, music and dance. Anamika means “That which has
no riarrie"'-arid true to its name, this institution, unfettered by dogmas and pettiness,
has worked faithfully, and with perserverance and has made its mark in the short
period of 13 years amongst the theatre groups of this country. Its main sphere of
activities has always been the theatre and it has attained signiﬁcant advancement in
the same.

In 1959 it got the ﬁrst prize in the Hindi play production competition

organised by Sangeet Natak Akaderni on an all India level.

In 1961 it was invited

as the only Hindi theatre group to participate in the Rabindra Centenary ceiebrations

held in New Delhi.

Again in 1963 it made a bold presentation in the “arena” style

which was a new land-mark in the history of theatre in a place like Calcutta.

It has been regularly producing one-act plays as well as full length plays.
Even though it is undertaking translations and adaptations from the other lndian and
foreign languages, it has constantly encouraged original Hindi play writings by

production of original Hindi plays even though they are so called literary, unsuitable
and weak plays.

Anamika sponsored a National Festival of Hindi Theatre in December 1964.
It invited the well-known theatre groups of the nation to produce their outstanding
productions and also organised a convention of Hindi Playwrights, Producers, Actors
and Critics.
