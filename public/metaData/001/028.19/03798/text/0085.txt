PRELU D E
Poverty is a vice as also a virtue. It is vice in that it saps the energies and
the meagre resouccs of the poor and kills initiative. It is a virtue in that it brings out
the best that is in man : fortitude, love, courage and, above all, sacrifice. Zamaana
is a commentary on our times and mirrors the hopes and aspirations and disapoint-

ment which are not foreign to the common man. And when all things go wrong does
not the common man remember God and draw strength from him ? He does, and you
will not miss it in Zamaana. With disappointment and dejection all round, man still
carries on and hope is the thing that makes him work and to wish for the best.
