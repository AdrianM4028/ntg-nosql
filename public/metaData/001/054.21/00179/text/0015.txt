COOPERATIVE WIN G

The Co-operative Wing of the

Little Theatre Group was

formed last year and has now been recognised by the Ministry of

Education.

Two scholars who had completed a course of three

years from the National School of Drama are attached to this Wing
and have been sanctioned a stipend of Rs. 200/— each for one year by

the Ministry of Education.

Our objective is to foster dramatic art through co-operation
to provide an opportunity for the development of theatrical activity
in India on professional lines.

In the Co-operative Wing, Little Theatre Group has enrolled
such talent as can and under proper guidance and training take up
acting or the stage as a career.

The Co-operative Wing intends arranging shows in Delhi and

nearby towns e.g. Meerut, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Chandigarh, Lucknow,
Kanpur, etc.

This is perhaps the ﬁrst venture of its kind and deserves full
support from the public.

Ours is a modest endeavour—we do not wish to make any
high faluting claims of either professional efﬁciency or

ability.
