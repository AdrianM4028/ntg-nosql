“ZANJEEREN” is the ﬁrst venture of the cooperative wing of the
Little Theatre Group. It is the aim of this wing to foster the growth 0f
dramatic activity on professional lines. Therefore, it gives us great pleasure
in presenting “Zanjeeren”—an adaptation by Meena Williams of a very
successful Marathi Play by V. S. Kanetkar, This play projects the perennial
conﬂict of ideas,

attitudes

and ideals—,that divide one generation from

another. The Playwright has successfully etched out the weakness and
strength of our social fabric and has also focussed our attention on some of
our urgent social problems.

This is the ﬁrst signiﬁcant play in our attempt to build a reportory
theatre, worthy of its name. In the very near future we shall be staging one
or two more plays, so that in course of time the reportory theatre becomes a

living reality.
We do hope that the Delhi theatre-public will respond enthusiasti-

cally to this new venture and offer to our promising band of actors and
actresses their wholehearted encouragement.
