P R ODU C E R ' S NOTE
Sohni Mahiwal is one of the four
famous legendary folk romances that
have been sung and recited in the
Punjab for nearly two centuries.
These love stories were ready themes
for all Punjabi poets, who rendered
them in a variety of styles and
poetic meters.
Sohni’s legend evidently predates
all of them except the original
persian model of Laila Majnu and
Sherin Farhad. References to the
tragic love of beautiful Sohni are
found in All: Mojal Granth. which is
believed to have been written in
ﬁfteenth century. Mr, Piara Singh
Padam of Patiala in his introduction
to Hashim’s Sohni (1957) records
ﬁfty versions of this tale which
were widely known in the folk
literature of the four North Indian
provinces of Punjab, Sindh, Rajasthan
and Gujrat Kathiawar.

Among the early versions are the ones
by the famous muslim mysric poets
Shah Hussain (of Lahore) in the ﬁrst
half of the sixteenth century and by
Bhai Gurdas in the later half, the last
of the Sikhs Gurus, Guru Govind
Singh in his Charitra Vialehvan
(17th century) also relates the
story, but makes Mahiwal a Jat of
the Ravi region.

Among the better known versions
of 18th and 19th centuries
are those of Hashim, Kadir Yar, and
the most popular one by Fazal Shah.

The ﬁrst dramatic version is by
Balwant Gargi (1957 staged at
Moscow in 1958) and a charming
adaptation in Urdu by the late Begum

for solving the difﬁcult problems
presented by such a large variety of

set in three major talas; Dadra,

The present production, makes no
attempt to reach out for historical
authenticity but seeks to stress the
purely poetic aspect of it.

humility, and record our gratitude
for the opportunity that we have it.
