Same morning Dula takes his master
to Tula’s shop but is disappointed not
to ﬁnd either him or his daughter
there .

Tula’s neighbour Karim wishes to sell
his wares to Mirza
Ezat Beg, who can scarce hide his
disappointment. Dula, however, cleverly

contrives to attract Sohni from inside
of the house by deliberately breaking a
pot from Tula’s shop. An indignant
Sohni comes out and rebukes Dula.
Mirza Ezat Beg apologises for his
servant’s misdemeanor and offers to buy
things from her. She too is attracted
by him and displays her goods with
winsome charms.

Meanwhile the jealous and shrewed
Karim detects the Mirza’s real

intentions and calls his daughter
Nooran, who is fascinated by her
friends’s salesmanship, to come away.
Tula, Sohni’s father arrives to ﬁnd
Sohni rejoicing over her successful
sales. Mirza introduces himself to
Tula and seeks permission to call at his
shop again.
While they all depart to their respective
places, the town faqir wends his way
through the street singing.
