INDRANI RA HMAN, outstanding exponent of
Bharata Natyam, is the daughter ofRagini Devi
(a pioneer in the revival of classical dance in
India) and Ramlal Bajpai. Since her childhood,
Indrani danced in her mother’s company in India,
Europe, and in America where she remained
during the war years. After returning to India in
1946, Indrani specialized in Bharata Natyam,

undergoing many years of training at Madras,
with the eminent Vidwan, Pandanallur Chocka-

lingam Pillai, whose foremost disciple she remains
today. Indrani has risen to be one of the topranking and most popular exponents of this art;
she strictly adheres to the austerely classical
Pandanallur style, yet performs the difficult Nritta
(pure dance) portions gracefully and eﬂortlessly,
and interprets the Abhinaya (facial expression)
with an eloquence obviously inspired by deep
feeling.
In addition to performing throughout India (at
Madras, Kakinada, Kumbakonam, Cuddalore,
Coimbatore, Bangalore,
Calicut, Cannanore,

Quilon and other cities in the south, Bombay,
Delhi, Calcutta, Lucknow, Allahabad, Banaras,

Patna, Indore, and other cities in the north)
Indrani has given performances in Rumania, the
Soviet Union, Ceylon (as the Indian Government’s
cultural representative during Ceylon’s National
Day celebrations), and in China as the leading
soloist of the Indian Government Cultural

Delegation.
