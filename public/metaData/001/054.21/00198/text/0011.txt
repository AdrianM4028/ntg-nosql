B r i j Leela
A cycle of expressive dance from the Rad ha Krishna legends.

(a) Kalia Daman

Krishna plays a game of ball on the banks of the Jamuna. While playing he deliberately
throws the ball into the river and Kalia, the Serpent King, who has been harrassing
everyone, emerges before his eyes.

He plunges into the river to fetch the ball, swims

about, ﬁnds Kalia and dances on his head. His friends go and tell of this to Mother
Yashoda. Kalia’s wives pray to Krishna to spare the life of their husband. Krishna
grants their prayer.

(b) Panghat

Radha goes to fill her pitcher. While returning, Krishna, who has been following her,
throws a pebble playfully and breaks the vessel. Radha is infuriated and walks away
purporting indifference to her lover, wringing the water from her clothes as she goes.

(6) Chir Haran

One fine morning the gopis go to the river Jumna for their bath. Krishna quietly steals
their clothes from the bank of the river and climbs a Kadamba tree. The girls, discovering their predicament, pray to the Lord Krishna for the return of their clothes.

(0') Mount G0 vardhan

Krishna had asked the people of Brij to worship Mount Govardhan in place of Lord
Indra. Indra is annoyed and orders Megh and Vayu to let loose a storm and a flood.
The men, women and children of the land weep and pray to Krishna to save them from
the elements. Krishna lifts Mount Govardhan on his little ﬁnger and gives shelter the
people/beneath it.
