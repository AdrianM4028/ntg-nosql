the Alarm Chain ! A train which is detained out of course may delay
other trains as well. lndiscriminate pulling of the
alarm chain means unnecessary wastage of
railway rolling stock and capacity, and
loss to the national exchequer;
it also causes hardship to
passengers who may be late
for school, office or

factory or miss connection
with other trains.
