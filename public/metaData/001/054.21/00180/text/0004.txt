A A PKA

Today happiness is measured by the wealth one has amassed and
the

gadgets

procured.

Happiness

has become

synonymous with the

possession of a car, television, air-conditioner, cooler, video-cassette, etc.

etc

This list is ever-increasing and inexhaustible.

The entire life-span is

spent in the rat race for acquiring them one after the other.

Yet happiness

continues to elude ..it always remains a distant dream, an ever-receding
mirage, an accursed chimera.

Then what is happiness?

Saadar Aapka explores this dilemma of mankind in dramatic idiom
through a story which is at once human and personal, with universal
va l id i ty .

The household of Brahrnanand is a typical case in a cosmopolitan
metropolis, engaged in the futile race to achieve happiness through acquisition of physical goods.

Brahmanand, his wife Lajja and daughter are

caught in the Whirlpools of their ambitions.

Like animals trapped in a

snare, they twist and turn yearning for release, yet unable to shake it off.
On this scene appears Rohit.

Coming from a small town, he embodies the

time tested values of love, faith and sacrifice.

In the ensuing conflict of

the ephemeral and the eternal. the contemporary and the age-old, emerges
the drama SAADAR AAPKA.
