“The Salt M arch”
By Kurt B ecs i
. दृ _ NM

(Translated from the original German by Gisela Schlemann-Gupta)

May 4 8: 5, I957
The theme of this play is the march of Mahatma Gandhi from Ahmedabad to Dandi to

lift salt from the sea—verily, the Salt March.

This incident provides the basis for a purely

human action——the love of the Indian, Sakuntala, for the English Ofﬁcer, Tanner.

The action

corresponds in essentials with the actual events (especially in the fourth and sixth pictures.)
Dramatisation of the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi is by no means a deviation but the central theme of modern drama, which is conscious of the problem with which we all are now-adays confronted.

For the message of the Gospel—that of humanitarianism and, with it, the power of
love and spirit—has never been portrayed as elementarin and proved through sacriﬁce till
death, as in the great movement of Mahatma Gandhi in India and in his teachings, which have
a great revolutionary value and meaning.

The Gandhian ideals endeavour to overcome the law of Karma in its historical reality,
and try to attain the goal through a “pure ﬁght”. Thus, Mahatma Gandhi has evolved a new
political method, which alone seems suitable for achieving its aims without undermining the

foundation of humanity.

This also leads us towards new human politics.

Therefore, Mahatma

Gandhi’s teachings have universal importance since India has always been inseparably connected
with the heart of humanity. Indeed, for many who know and love India, she is the very heart
of the world, as Europe is the brain.
