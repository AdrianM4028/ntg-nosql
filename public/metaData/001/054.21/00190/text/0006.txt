songs interspersed in the plays not related to the theme. These songs and dances are:
vulgar imitations आं current films having no basis in foil: tradition.
This play is being presented by the L.T.G. in the traditional style with the help of
professional Nautanki artists from Kanpur. The audienCe will see all the preliminaries~
Lahara, Pathawari Ambika and Bhent or Sunririni. The stage used for the performance
is also the simple, urradorned platf‘orri-‘r‘stag'e and the spectators in the traditional‘ manner
are seated on the three sides of the stage. Other conventions regarding the entry and‘.
exit of the characters, the delivery of dialogue, use of Range; the narrator, have also)
been retained in the traditional manner. We have, howevet,. been compelled to allow
the use of Harmoniuin which has become an integral part of Naritanki orehestra for the
last over three decades under the inﬂuence of the Parsee Theatre.

It is in the same direCtion and with the same objective that the Bharatiyal'Natya
Sangh is holding a festival 'o'f folk plays frorn'May 10 to May l5. In this festival the
folk plays from three regionselatra from Bengal, NautankifrornUttamedeS‘h and;
Maach from Madhya Pradesh Will he presented,

it is hoped that We will he able to

revitalize the folk forms and enable our urh’an theatre Workers to know our folk
dramatic heritage and this mutual exchange will enrich our contemporary theatre
movement.
