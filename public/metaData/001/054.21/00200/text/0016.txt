PRODUCER’S NOTE
As anybody who knows anything about amateur theatre will realise,
to produce a play of this magnitude has not been an easy task.
Our biggeSt problem has been to find suitable players for the

immeasurable small parts in this play.

This we have been able to overcome

by doubling parts, by judicious cutting, and even by eliminating a number
of the minor roles. ३

Few actors or actresses, whether professional or amateur , like to be
cast for a small part, and we are most grateful to the cast of this ,play who
have cheerfully turned up regularly for rehearsals, which has often meant
that they have had to wait around for about 90% of the rehearsal time to
rehearse lines which occupy only a few minutes. Equally grateful are we
for the forbearance with which many of them have equally cheerfully
changed their roles as the rehearsals have progressed and we have got to

know them better and felt them to be more suited for other roles.

The play, we hope. will speak for itself. An unusual feature is what
may be called a running commentary by story—tellers and a chorus
This

fills up gaps and tells the audience what happens in between sequences and
often introduces the action of a sequence,

Brecht demands a certain amount of impersonality in his
plays.
This is not easy to achieve, although we have tried. His
idea is that the
play should be a kind of commentary upon life. Obv
iously of course it
would be impossible for any player to rid his role—"of all
personality. We
hope, it will be a convincing production and enjoyable
for you all.
