In pre_lndependence era, India had plans

and programmes for social and economic
betterment of thel people. But there was

a fundamental weakness — the weakness of
their belonging more to the Government
than to the people.

Independence came, and with it a new
awakening. and people's plans, for the people
,
by the people. The results were tangible
—

more and _more of better and cheaper things;
a better way of life for more and
yet more neople of our land.

We of DALMlA ENTERPRISES
have been censtantly endeavouring to
produce more and more of such goods that

contribute towards improved living standards

of Our people.

We are doing this not only

since Independence but almost for a quar
ter

of a century. The task is not so easy.
Yet we are going ahead. undauntedly, in the

Hope of seeing a brighter tomorrow. . ..
a new dawn _ , , , along the new ho
rizons.
