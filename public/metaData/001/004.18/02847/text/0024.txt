The play was difficult in the sense that movements

were restricted and there was no scope for melodrama.
Yet the audience remained glued to their seats and
applauded repeatedly over the sparking performances.
A few actors were miscast because of their accent,
diction and their appearance which wasn't army like.
Nevertheless, Pranab Bhattacharya as Bikash Roy, Malay
Mishra as Col. Surat Singh, Shanti Bhushan as subedar
Balwaan Singh and Ajit Bahadur as Ram Chandra justified
their roles. The lighting was appropriate, but the sets
needed more attention. The defective acoustics of the

auditorium resulted in reverberations and distorted the
clarity of speech. It was really a very good show and
kudos to Bhowmick and his artistes.
