The local viewers were given a rare chance to see a
theatrical adaptation of a court-martial by Samanantar
Intimate Theatre. The lively playm named Court Martial,
was staged at the jam-packed Jagat Taran Girls Degree
College auditorium last week. That despite the sultry and
humind weather conditions viewers struggled to even get
a place to stand in the auditorium was quite an unusual
' and pleasant sign for local theatre. The play by Swadesh
Deepak and the director AR. Bhowmick and all the
artistes deserve full credit for the spectacular show.
Court Martial was a story about oppression, feudal
tendencies and casteism. The theme may be oftrepeated
but the structure and the background was unusual. it
begins with the opening proceedings of the court martial
of an. army jawan, Ram Chandra, who had killed one of
his officer and had attempted to kill another, Capt B.D.
Kapoor. He confesses his crime but doesn‘t plead guilty
either. Despite the death wish of Ram Chandra, Capt
Bikash Roy, .the defence counsel, defends him and in the
process rips apart the masks of upper class pride from the
.क्रि faces of the hypocrites.

GUILTY ONES : it finds that everyone is guilty, juilty of
ignoring and suppressing the facts of misdeeds of an
officer (Capt. Kapoor) against a simple, loyal soldier,
Towards the cllmax, Capt Kapoor, having been exposed

by the defence counsel, turns violent and later kills
himself.
