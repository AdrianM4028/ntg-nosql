- The light effects were simple and sparse in keeping
with the gravity of the theme of the play. The make up, the
constume and the stage decore made the theme realistic.
Before the play began Mr. P.K. Mandal the President of
Samanantar (not Nivedak as his name was used)
welcomed the guests in the beginning and spoke a few
words about Theatre. He said it should be able to attract
the audience to buy tickets and should in no case beg
them to see their show.
