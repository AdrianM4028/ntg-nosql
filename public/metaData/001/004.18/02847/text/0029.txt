Eventually, Captain Kapoor's taunts, in which his friend
Captain Verrna also participants, reach a point where not
only is Ramchandar reviled because of his caste but

asperisions are also cast

upon his mother‘s Character.

The disciplined soldier, who was _ always received the
plaudits of his superiors in all things, suddenly breaks
through all barriers and guns down his tormen tors.
lnspite of the odd technical mistake, such as court
room proce dure, the dark deeds of Captain Kapoor, are
brought out skillfully by the Defence Counsel. He also
sheds light on the various ways in which the Battalion CO,
the medical Officer and other have collabcreated with
Kapoor due to the mistaken mindset of ‘the officer (rling
class) is always right'.
The entire play is developed in a way that the audience ~
begins to identify, even admire, the courage, appreciate
the cunning and determinatio of the Defences Counsel as
he stalks his victims and suffers with the silent, disciplned,

and brave Ramchandar.
The Court Martial, through the skilled rnaneuerings of
Captain Rai, is transformed into an inquisition, purging the
system of the impure and upholding the high traditions.
Captain Kapoor‘s suicide and the final pact between
Ramchandar and Colonel Surat Singh are denouement.

The final argument is, in fact, the calsh of contrasting
ideolo gies. It depicts the motivations that lie behind the

actions of the oppressed and the oppressors. it indicates
how the tedious avenues of legitimate protest lead
nowhere. How the protest of the powerful leads on to
acquistion of greater power while the protest of the week
is termed as rebellion.
