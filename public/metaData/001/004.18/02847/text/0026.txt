Mahabharat that Indra planned all this, and later Krishna
claims he planned for Ghatotkachs birth and sacrifice-but
there is never a suggestion of exploitation by the "uppercaste" Pandavas and their mother. They respect
Ghatotkach as, a warrior and shed tears at his death«even
as Krishna starts singing and dancing around the
battlefield in unseemly joy at the sight, exulting that his
good friend Arjun .is now safe, and Kama as good as
dead. (What a good scene that would have made, though
even more controversial-though a lot less like Mr. P.V.
Narasimha Raol In the original, Ghatotkach doesn‘t hang
on to deliver an endless soliloguy at deaths door. A man .
of action, with tremendous magical powers, he transforms
his body to be as "large as the Vindhyas" before he dies,
so that in falling, he may crush hundreds of the enemy as
'
his last act.

In short the original has a delicate feet that the players,
whatever their caste and class, are all part of cobweb of
fate spun by the Gods, all equally pawns. This is a far cry
from the uses of caste in the modern day, and the

exploitation shown in the play.

A third, and final, problem with the piay as presented
was that it seemed to want to make a statement in avour
of basic human values, rather than the perversion or
destruction of these values by tradition, hirerarcy “the

system“. But it actuaiiy showed precieus little in the way of
honest human values, with a brief giimpse of parental love

being the only real positive emotion. This embalance
needs fixing if the play is to its: impreved.
