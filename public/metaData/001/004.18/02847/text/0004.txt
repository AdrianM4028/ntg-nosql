for his life. The play goes on to stir up these existing
ingredients with a contemporary suggestion of caste and
outcaste, class exploitation -and even the political
situation in U.P., with the Prime Minister featured as the
somewhat aloof, chess-playing Sri
Krishna who
orchestrates the sacrifice of the half-rakshas Pandava

son. The ultimate message seems to be that the
"underclass" Rakshas-log should remain true to
themselves and not allow themselves to be 'used or
manipulated by outsiders.
The play showed the Shri Ram Centre, and B.V. ,
Karant connections of both \writer and director in the style
of staging which was fairly polished. The set was the
simple draped sort of backdrop favoured for this sort of
thing, and made visually appealing enough by stage
esigner Shiv Kumar Gupta. Special effects such as
abarik's disembodied head were realised simple and
mootth enough. Lighting by Sujay Ghoshal worked as
expected - no nasty surprises- and make up by Anil
Chaudhari was good. Costumes by Naeem Khan were
simple and onobtrusive- but why on earth did Kunti have
to wear a kurta, Mogal-style, at that? Salli Shrivastava and '
Vinod Yadav brought in some interesting dramatic music,
though it often tended to go on too long without anything
interesting on stage, and it seems pathetic that the sound
system at the NCZCC so often plays an undertone of AIR
along with the play!
As for the acting, Nisha Saraswat did a sustained
performance as the hurt and enraged Hidimba, with

had the difficult role of Ghatotkach, which he

did with great energy and disCipline, but unfortunately the
conception of the character left him too often writing in a
stylised fashion that failed to evoke any real sympathy.
