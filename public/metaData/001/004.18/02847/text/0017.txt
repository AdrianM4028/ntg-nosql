Dr. Prabhat Mandal

'Manthan' staged by Samanantar in the NCZCC
auditorium on October 26 depicted the tragedy of the
Rakchhasi, Hidimba and her progjeny as she tried to

ernancipate her tribe from the level

of subhuman

assistance set against the backdrop of Mahabharata, Lord
Krishna and the Pandavas were portrayed as selfseekers

and devoid of ethical values of human relationship since
they conspired to sacrifiCe Ghatotkatch, Bhima‘s own son
in order to save Arjuna in the garh of 'Dharma Yuddha‘.
The play wright Vibhanshu Vabhav succeeded in his
objective of releting the epic with the present socio
political scenario.

A R Bhoumick, ' director handled

the play aptly. ॰_

However, the use of elements of folk the atre lacked

finesse, the abstract design on the backdrop was
confusing and the use of synthesiser for musical effects
was not compatiable with the nature and spirit of the play.
In the cast, Nisha Sarswat as

Hidimba, Shanti

Bhusan as Ghatotkatch deserve special mention. Other

artistes were Danish iqbal, Manish Srivastava, Ajai Kesari,
Sangeeta Agrawal, Ashok Dwivedi and Sunil Kurnar
Srivastava. It was apparent that it was a painstakingly
produced play which is a rarity these days. 'It was also
heartening to note that serious and meaningful plays are
still received well by the audience.
