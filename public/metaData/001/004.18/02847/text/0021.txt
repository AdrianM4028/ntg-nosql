mankind are bought to the fore and the audience is at
once shocked and overwhelmed to realise that in reality it
is not the simpleton, Fiamchandra, but our corrupt society
which is being court rnartialled. This realisation stays on till
the end even as Ramchandra is awarded capital

punishment. The sting of the sentence is deleted by the
last (his first too) drink he has with the Presiding Judge (a
senior Army Officer) who has specially invited him to a

get-together with other officers.
The only discomfort (lots of it) that the people faced in
the small but jam packed hall of . Jagat Taran was
suffocating heat together with intense humidity. Some
were compelled to go out for a breath of fresh air. Pranav
Bhattacharya had the rneatiest role as Defence Counsel

Cap. Vikas Rat and did full justice to it, though at time his
actions were just a little repetiitive.The Presiding Judge,
Col. Surat Singh (Malaya Mishra) was also appreciated.
Ramachandra played by Ajit Bahadur was very
touching. His sudden break-down before Capt. Rat's
volley of questions which he was too ashamed to answer
(repeating the abuses he had to tolerate for a long time)

came as a climax. The eyes of the audience filled up even
as their hands began to clap at the same time.

Capt. B.D. Kapur, played by AR. Bhawmik was again

good. He-succeeded making the audience hate him.

Dialogues between him and Capt. Rai revealed a. lot by
way of a true insight into the Army life. They were catchy,
clear and well modulated.
The Prosecutor, Maj. Puri (Anurag Tewari) could have

had more expression otherwise too, he had pretty little to
do.
