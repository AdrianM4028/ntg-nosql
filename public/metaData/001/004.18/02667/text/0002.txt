A Court Martial, presided over by Surat Singh
goes into the case of Jawan Ram Chandar
accused of shooting down an ofﬁcer, Captain
' Mohan Verma, and wounding another ofﬁcer,
Captain Kapoor. The ‘Extenauting Circumstances’ are not considered adequate to grant the
accused a reprieve, and he is duly sentenced
to death. But what is revaled in the course of
the trial in the harrowing tale of an ekcellent
soldier and sportsman, born a low caste, driven
by continuous humiliation and deprivation to
take the desperate step of attacking Captain
Kapoor, whose crimes agaist humanity loom
large in the evidene that accumulates in the
case. The power and the facade of faceless
discipline that characterise the military order
that almost constitutes a state in itself cover
up a - subtearanean system that nurtures the
crudest kind of partiarely, rank egotisrn, caste
prejudice and vulgar sexism. The pilling up the
evidence has the force to drive Captain Kapoor

to suicide and vindicate the justice the presiding

ofﬁcer Surat Singh had

been pursuing so

humaner and yet infructuously.
