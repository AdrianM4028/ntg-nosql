Futher, while Nadir is an actual, historical personage,
Allawi is a fictional character and the two again lend
more strength to the play as an interplay of the ’real’
and the imaginative/ imaginary’. If in "I'ughlak’ Tughlak
and Aziz appear to be the original and the copy respectively, here, on the other hand, Nadir and Allawi
are like the potographic negative and the positive.
Dr. Sudhir Kakar, the famous Indian psychologistthinker discusses in one of his works the ’folk mindhealers’ of India. Interestingly, the very first chapter of
that book speaks about a native healer who in most
ways resembles Allawi Khan. Further on, in the last
chapter, discussing the similarities and the differences
between the modern Western method of psychiatry and
the traditional Indian/Eastern one Dr. Kakar points
out the significant fact that whereas the Western
method is ’analytical' and therefore, by implication

’neutral’ the Indian mode is ’synthetical’ and hence
’fostering and nurturing'. Allawi Khan, in an identical
fashion works not only like and analyser but also a
healer, making Nadir surrender himself to him as a
child to a parent.
The play, thus tries to explore the possibility of moving
from the ’Western reductionist’ mode as seen in the
first two Acts towards the ’Eastern holistic' mode as in
the Third and . the last. Nonetheless, it does not in-

dulge in simplistic, parochial formulations or
commedations. Although Allawi does bring about a
cure in Nadir the play is not very sure about its finality

or longevity. Hence, it calls Nadir not as the Cured’,
but as 'the Convalescent’- ’Gunamukha', i.e. ’moving
towards Cure.’ Thanks to P. Lankesh, Basavaraj Akshara
