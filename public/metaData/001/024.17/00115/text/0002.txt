The influence of fanas like Billa on the young

minds is so strong that i-lakarrtis’s son and nephew too are caught in the violent
moment. The police prove even worse enemies. The potent religious fanatics and
the impotent government have wrought the ruin ofja poor man and his family. The
emphasis in this production is on simplicity and informality of approach, the chief
characteristic of ‘Naqal’, the Punjabi folk form of arena theatre.
