OUR ACTIVITIES
COLLEGIATE DRAMA SOCIETY was formed in 1978 by some teachers and stu—
dents of Delhi University with two baslc purposes in mind.
and direction to the creative urge of these people

First, to give motivation

by forming a group which was

completely their own and could work at par with the professional groups of Delhi
theatre

Second, to produce plays prescribed in the syllabus of Delhi University. We

have since been successful in both our purposes.

We have produced original Punjabi and Hindi plays and have received much '
applause from both the audience and the critics. With our repeated efforts we have

been successful in raising the reputation of Punjabi plays from only 'smutty farces'
to respectable theatre.

Our activities are described as “a serious attempt to create

a better and wholesome image of Punjabi Theatre in Delhi”.

Now the group consists of, apart from University teachers and students, a young

clan of businessmen and professionals running varied units ranging frcrn P.V C.
footwear to chemicals, from advertising agency to readyrnade garments. Despite
their busy schedules, they find time to serve the theatre in a healty, congenial atmos-

phere.

It is this feeling of being one family that has taken us so far.

Some members of our group have acted in films, advertising commercials, T.V.

Serials and T.V. short films.

The group nowadays is also busy in making a television

serial of one of its productions.

In addition to the critical acclaim and audience support, the group has also
bagged nine prizes in the Annual Drama Competitions conducted by Sahitya Kala
Parishad—five first prizes for script-writing, one for direction and three for acting.
We

have also received three prizes from Punjabi Academy—ode for best script and two
for acting.
