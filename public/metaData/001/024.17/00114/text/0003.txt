About the Play

Shree Pad-Rekha Granth is a tragi comedy about our superstitious countrymen fooled by clever astrologers and godrnen.
The young Pandit Banarsi Das and his uncle Chunni Lal

devise a scheme to become rich by predicting people’s future.
They declare that they have discovered a very old manuscript
written by the sage Bhrigu. This book is revolutionary. Bhirgu
asserts that a person's future can be correctly foretold only
by reading the lines on his foot or sole. Not Palmistry but

Solistry is the true science.
The nephew and the uncle forge thousands of footprints and

their astrological interpretation in Sanskrit. They use bhojpatras or ancient looking papers. With their huge bundle of
new horoscopes or footprints, the two leave their native

village in Hoshiarpur to seek their fortune in Delhi.
Soon the two have a quarrel abdut the share in profits. The
nephew steals away with the sacred book. Chunni Lal vows
vengeance. He is dogging his nephew’s steps in the rnetro
polis. Aslarn lsrani, a police detectivein the garb of poet,
agrees to help the old man in nabbing the young scoundrel.
