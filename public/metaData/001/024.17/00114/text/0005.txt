Collegiate Drama Society
COLLEGIATE DRAMA SOCIETY was formed in 1978 by
some Teachers and students of Delhi University with two basic
purposes in mind. First, to give motivation and direction to

the creative urge of these people by forming a group which
was completely their own and could work at par with the professional groups of Delhi Theatre. Second, to produce plays
prescribed in the text syllabus of Delhi University.

We have

since been successful in both our purposes.

We’ve produced original Punjabi and Hindi plays and have
received much applause from both the audience and the critics. With our repeated efforts we have been successful in

’aiSlng thereputation of Punjabi plays as onlyj‘smutty farces'
to

respectable theatre.

Our activities are described

as

“serious attempt to create a better and wholesome image of
Punjabi Theatre in Delhi” writes The Statesman.

Now the Group consists of, apart from University teachers
and students. a young clan of businessmenand professionals
running varied units ranging from P.V.C. footwear to chemicals,

from

advertising , agency

to

readyrnade

garments.

Despite their busy schedules they find time to serve the
theatre in a healthy, congenial atmosphere. ' It is this fee'lin -

of being one family that has taken us so far.
Some members of our group have acted in films, advertising

cornrnerials, T. V. Serials and T. V. short films.

The group

_

nowadays is also busy in making» of a television serial of one

'

of its productions.
Apart from the ’critical acclaim and audience support, the
group has also bagged nine prizes in the Annnual Drama

Competitions conducted by Sahitya Kala Parishad—five first
prizes for script-writing, one for direction and three for

acting.

We have also received three prizes from Punjabi
