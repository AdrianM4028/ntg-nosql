Director's Note
Now Notorious as " Dr. Sidhu's Funniest Tragedy on Indian
Education, "KALL COLLEGE BAND RAHEGA" has been

enjoyed and admired by audiences and drama critics for about two

decades. Many universities in India and abroad have prescribed Kall
College Band Rahega as a textbook for their BA. and MA. students.
About two dozen scholars have discussed and analyzed this classic in
their books, articles and PhD. dissertations.

"The play is a scathing expose of the Delhi University
scene. It spares neither teachers nor students. Sidhu builds the
play around an incident in which two innocent students were
implicated in a sex scandal by a scheming Professor that led to a boy's
suicide. A meeting of the college disciplinary committee that
inhumanly grills the two innocent teenagers is used by the playwright

to expose the callous attitude of the teachers, their slimy intrigues and
kowtowing to the politicians. While exposing academicians Sidhu

does not spare the student leaders either -- the RSS types and
the pseudo leftists."
- Rornesh Chander, The Times of India.

" Beneath the humorous picture that Sidhu draws lie some
shocking statements ......... .. The play has current interest ..... the quick
pace required of the script..... the intriguing plot that sustains the
viewers' interest."
- Gayatri Sinha, Indian Express.

" Dr. Sidhu's picture is horrifying but true. He writes from
first—hand knowledge but he reacts like a compassionate artist. It is

not a catalogue of facts but a very moving human document. "
