FOREWORD

Newspaper pages are turning red. Everyday, we start with

breaking news of bloodshed.
May it be London, Iraq, Ayodhya or even our west Bengal. Our
memory of World ’l‘rae Centre destruction, Gujrat riot and many
others are not yet also faded.

It could be caused by differences in religion, cast, country or
politics; it culminates in violence and bloodshed.
The hatred among mankind, the distance among human
beings are being increased day by day. A fear is gradually
eclipsing us.
There are possibly a handful of peOple gaining out of this. But,
majority of the world do not believe this.

Let’s say no to this. Let’s be hand in hand to prevent this.
Our motto of the Festival is to join the hands of all colours—
cultures of all community and the respect of mankind.
