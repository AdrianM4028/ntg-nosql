4. Disease.
Misuse of the voice

Excessive talking or shouting may lead to voice abuse. But how will we know whether we
have misused the voice or not?
These symptoms mentioned below are the ones we should look for:

a. Pain in the throat while Speaking.
b. Change of voice.
c. Repeated coughing to clear the voice before speaking.

d. Hoarseness of the voice early in the morning or before going to sleep.
Creative people are often by nature absentminded and disorganized. Lost in the pursuit
of perfection, they neglect to take proper care of themselves. Many of them indulge in
excessive talking. A word of caution for those in this category —- it will do you good to
remember that not all voice related problems are curable. It is far better and safer to look
after the voice when it is hale and hearty. If you consider your voice to be a valuable asset,

take care of it now by giving it the protection it deserves.
Addiction and voice

Smoking invariably leads to Laryngitis, Pharyngnis. Bronchitis, Tuberculosis . Cancer or
cardiac problems.

PanMasala, Guraku etc leads to our other disease called submucuos oral fibrosis in
addition to those already mentioned. This disease toughens up the oral cavity and the soft
palate and makes both speaking and swallowing difficult. The throat seems to burn and the

tongue becomes infested with sores. Many of them ultimately turn into Cancer.
There are no greater enemies of the throat than tobacco and Panmasala. Yet many of the
vocalists and actors are found to be addicted to them. It would be prudent to remember
