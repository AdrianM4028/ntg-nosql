Gaatha the 1 st text
A black street ...... melody of a lullaby ...... Jharuwala— the host of that space, wakes up,

wipes out the garbage in a morning. He can see the street. Street? A long black snake ......
The street stands between man and his academics certificates are like currency notes.

Ashes of h0pe burn and the smoke rises in the high wind. Nothing to be done. All strategic
plans of a state has been in the cold stOrage for last 56 years.
A few people loose their patience, a few still continue like Jharuwala who suddenly feels
that he has lost his everything. Jharuwala has a library of history, but he runs after rubber,
steel, remote machine etc. He feels the tragedy when he sees the local people are turning
' into Jesus with a thorn helmet.
‘Bhumi’ is a space where we belong and we move to another spaces to maintain our
relationships Other peOple try to occupy our space. Our strong parliamentary politics just
give them benefits. Are our identities safe?

People loose faith in time, time looses faith also, time rebels, youth rebels against
time ...... history rebels, rebuilds gun and terror builds a new culture. Bloodshed makes
today’s living Macbeths. And we? We pretend to be comfortable in it. The black snake ...... a
'

venomous fang.

Our ethnic existence? Let the matter be drOpped. The glitter of glossy doesn’t stay a long.
The black snake cannot kill our desires and h0pes. Self determination will be unanswered
question.
'

We quess, we know that why the mainstream has become a platform for a new identity.
Jharuwala’s bookshelf is ready for a better purpose.

The 1 st world mesmerizes us with its packaging, plasticity etc. The globe is open to us.
Let’s dare to dream and we, who dream— are not dreaming.
