India is seriously lagging behind in applying theatre practice to various social and

developmental needs. There is a false notion amongst bureaucrats and politicians that
theatre is only entertainment and therefore theatre training should be limited to performer
training. This mindset needs to be changed.

Ecological crisis in Culture
Theatre has been badly hit with the advent of the entertainment industry. We let the
industry take away all the talent. We did not ask the industry to replant the cultural forest.
Today people are getting bored with television and want to come back to live performance.
But live performance is in a shambles. Who will correct this imbalance?

If theatre has to become people’s expression it has to speak people’s language and
happen amongst peOple. Abhivyakti Abhiyan is a national campaign to protect people‘s
expression. Let us join hands to make Indian theatre truly a people's theatre.
