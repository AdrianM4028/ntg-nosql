Hence Rangakarmee was formed with the object

of ‘More well produced, socially meaningful plays for a larger audience”, we

thought to initiate a process of staging plays in factory gates, working class

areas and in bastees and launching organised ticket selling in offices, banks,
factories, schools and colleges.

Rangakarmee also started a concious effort of collaboration between

Hindi Group Theatre Workers and more matured and experienced Bengali
Group Theatre Workers. In these 11 years of intense dedicated activities we
have produced 10 successful productions and staged our plays almost all over

India.

Three of our productions have been awarded by The West Bengal

Government and different societies.
