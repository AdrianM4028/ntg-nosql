KINU KAI-EARE'K Ti-Ic‘l‘E'K C] BAHURUPEE

Born of ’harij an’ parents in a village, Kinu chose the profession of an

artiste, who knows why.

Presently he acts as a master of his village Theater

group.

Kinu and his party compose and sing song and stages their plays. In
his plays, like wheels within wheels, we find life and drama marvellously
intermingled.

Even then they stage mythological tales we find in these the

story of their own life strugle.

But they get an extra dimention when they

sail across the tales of the Kings, the Ministers, the Clowns, the Governors
or the Poilce and the Sentries and pass on to the country as a whole.

’Ghantakarna' plays the role of a scape goat of 'the society.
central charactor of Kinu's new play.

He is the

‘Ghantakarna' bears on his shoulder all

social evils and their consequences like the tree that carries the gruesome
barden of the stone chips hung from it by wistful people at the pulpit of the
village deity.
