TRADITIONAL THEATRE

Jaani Chor — Sang of Haryana
Written by: Lakhmi Chand

Direction: SATISH KASHYAP
Presented by Navras Swang Mandali, Hissar
Duration: 80 minutes

Director’s Note
It's always a great pleasure for me to associate myself with
Swang whenever I get a chance. Folk music and folk

dances, the main ingredients of Swang, are fascinating and
cool and relaxed in performance. Swang means to imitate,
to color, and giving performance a form. Final design is a
classical example of Swang. Costume design was kept in
its original mythological form. Nakkara, clarnet, dholak,
harrnoniurn, chorus singing has made this a production a
memorable experience.
