If we pray to Allah honestly and sincerely, we will definitely meet him. Though we are continuously
amidst our material pursuits and we like to confine ourselves to own family yet we are connected to
the divine blessings of Allah invisibly. Our physical entity is absolutely dependent on our spirit that

control our life and the ultimate supreme power belongs to Allah.

Neriba Allahre name mullath
Neriba sahebor Naam

Human body is the dwelling place of Allah. When Allah wants to take away the spirit, nothing can stop

or keep one's spirit far away.

The tremendous pain and grief made Sharban weep wildly with her open hair and even her hair
touched the dust of the ground. Her husband fought singlehandedly without any accompaniment and
that made her very sad and this Zari geet reflects her unbearable pain inside her mind.

Dul Dul is Hussain's horse coming back alone after his master's demise in the battle field. Sharban at
once rushes towards the horse to ask about her husband But, the horse only blood stain on his

forehead and he fails to utter any words. The horse seems to be also helpless.
