Zi kir
The Assamese Muslims have a class of devotional songs

with a philosophical undercurrent, which are known as
Zikir (Arabic Ziqr). These devotional songs with
philosophical overtones are still considered to be the

valuable contributions to the Assamese literature, and
have been sung by people for various social and cultural
performances since the seventeenth century onwards.
These songs remained in the heart and soul of the
common, illiterate people for long, but it is natural that

Zikir and Zari songs, which were popular among the illiterate masses have changed from its original
form without losing its original message. With the passage of time, these songs have found a
prominent place in the hearts of both Muslims and Hindus.

Za ri

Zari Geets or Morchia Geets of Assam are based on the tragic story of Karabala. But these geets

based on the story of Karabala are to be found not only in lndia, but all over the world.
The Zari Geets were sung by the Assamese Muslims before the arrival of Azan Saheb. And these
songs, though based on the tragic tales of Karabala are sung with a deep devotional tone. That is
why, these Zari Geets used to attract people’s attention easily and could spread the message of
devotion amongst the listeners.

Synopsis
Mor mahat bhed bhab nal O’ Allah

Mor manat bhin por na/ 0’ Allah
Hindu kl Musa/man, Eke Allah’s Formah

In One Zikir, It is mentioned that there is no distinction between a Hindu and a Muslim. Everybody is
equal in the eyes of Lord, so there should not be any discrimination amongst human beings based on
religion.
