With an abundance of talent and _॰ general enthusiasm in this

vibrant theatre which responds to to the cultural longings of the
peeple. Only there is need to organize and groom the talent
and channel ise the enthusiam towards quality theatre.

We criticise the Hindi cinema but lean upon it for entertainment.
Our hope lies in the section of people who are culturally aware,
are deeply dissatisfied and are ready to actively participate in
the growth of good theatre in the city.

Chandigarh can boast of a large number of educated and enlightened peeple-professors, doctors, government officials, clerks

and ordinary working class people—who can all join in the
adventure called theatre. We do not belieVe in any distinctions.

Three thousand years of theatre history are sufficient proof that
whenever theatre transcended artificial class barriers it touched
its zenith. Shakespeare's

theatre

was for

the

royalty as

well as groundlings.
It must be realised that theatre is a creative medium and certain

conditions are necessary for its progress. There has to be a large
number of trained and skilful actors, directors and sensitive
playwrights and, above all, spectators who are not mere passive
observers but are willing to get involved. True that these conditions do not exist at the moment and that is where the challenge
lies

P.C.P.A. counting on your support, accepts the challenge.
