These are happy signs---signs that the message of
small family norm has taken roots and the people
of Haryana have accepted it as a progressive idea.
The growth rate of population has come down
This
from 33.79 in I95I-6I to 35.30 in I96l-7I.
fall is the highest in the country after West
Benga I .
The task of bringing down the high birth-rate is
enormous and complex. But the continued pro-

gress in this

field gives us hope that with a

combination of peopleâ€™s participation and dedicated services, it is possible to motivate large
masses towards the philosophy of small family

norm.
A small family is a happy family.
Happy families make a happy nation.
