MASK - …
by J . P. D AS

I keep many masks;
for day and night and evening too;
for a moment’s mirth,
for the last act of a tragedy,
for guests and co-travellers,
one-time sweetheart and her spouse;
for emperor, soldier, harlot, magician,
for dead men and for processions;
for exiled sky and startled dawn;
for love and for defence and deception.
diverse guises I wear

at every phase of my life.
I searched for such a mask
that in her eyes’ touch of blue
all the virgins would come under my spell;

at the slightest twitch of my firm lips
enemies would admit defeat;
in one glance
all the birds in the sky
would wing into my cage;
I will summon night and sun shall set.

That mask I could never get.
All my masks are of mere tiny surprises,
most cheap laughters, i ndiﬁerent mirth
and sterile sulk, most feeble cry

and impotent remorse.
My mask is of flimsy love
and of very trivial grief.
With that mask on I entertain guests,
chant mantras,
make love to my wife and my mistress:
at times | talk to the heavens
and look at the stars;

and get lost so easily
among throngs of peOple.

My years grow from mask to mask,

from one deception to another,
through the guises some try
to know me; some others
knowing seem not to know.

If at times | feel
I have lost my credentials

I try to see myself and look at the walls,
rows and rows of masks
and scattered glass pieces alone.
No point in questioning the mirror.
