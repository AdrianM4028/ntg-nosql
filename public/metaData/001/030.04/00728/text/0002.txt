AIHURE

by Shri Mbhan ﬁakesh

Play in Hindi

presented by

Dishantar, New Delhi

The Play

Adhe Adhure is a play depicting the inner suffocation and sense of
depriva
tion of the present day urban middle class. It has a pattern that evolves r

according to the realistic convention and yet breaks it;

Set in New Delhi

of 1968, the play portrays the man—woman relationship in
today's 8००1०economic context with all its tensions, conflicts and contradictio
ns. It is
a piece of drama that is too familiar and too shocking at the
same time.
