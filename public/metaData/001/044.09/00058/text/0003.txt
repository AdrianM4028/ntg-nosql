Directed by Kirti.Jain,
this exercise attempts
to expose each
indiVid'al stu
dent of the first yea
r to the Proces

s which culminates
in the production of a rea
listic play. It is for thi
s reason that:
the

students have been div
ided intofour:~ Acts,
enabling each student
to play a part.' Thus
we have different actors
playing one character
in dif

ferent Acts.
