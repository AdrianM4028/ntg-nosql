A NOTE.
Many dcubts were raised when we were first infor
med that as
part of our Class~room Production we were to do
Rakesh's "Ashad ka

Ek Din”. Why do a realistic play so early in the train
ing course?

During the twentyafive odd days of rehearsals a lot of things
emerged. While a lot of initial discussions and analysis had led to
some general consensus regarding basic themes and character patterns,
once on the floor we felt at sea. As part of the exercise,we had to
work out our own motivations and accordingly,moves. Inexperienced*
'and Inhibited as most of us are at this stage,we blundered with each
other and ourselves.

None of us fully comprehended the demands of the
stanislavskian "subtext". The- process was reversing. From the outer
face of the role we were tryin0 to move inwands.

It could not be so.

The more blunders we made, the more we learned. We learnt of
our inhibitions and lack of application and co—ordination. Nonetheless
we all feel the richer for the experience. The awareness of detail,
which is a great demand of a realistic play has been registered by

us.

LikewiSe being guided on the techniques of acting, we feel.more

equipped in projecting our respective characters.
Directed by Kirti Jain, this exercise attemp-ts to expose each
individual student of the first year to the Process which culminates
in the production of a realistic play.

It is for this reason that
