that I do not use the word "Divine" or

Indian Theatre" by just bringing traditional art forms as they are into it?
Each traditional performing art has its'

unusual, uncommon fact whose base is

innate to man. The modern theatre
should not take on loan just lVludras,
movement patterns and costumes from
traditional theatre forms. Our work
should be to try to imbibe the quality
of this spirit and infuse such a sirniler
quality into modern Indian theatre.
And this quality should be self-generating. Only then can modern lndian
theatre reach this “diviness”.
