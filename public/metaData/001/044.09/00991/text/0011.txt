SET EXP LORI? ‘ION

Ghasiram Kotwal depicts a clear social picture
in the reign of Peswa Bajirao.

The corruption

prevailed in the society kills the morality of
mankind.
The play is ‘so relevant that it
projects the truth directly to the mass without
needing any accessavies like set; make-up etc.Keeping this flexibility of the play in mind
aveset is disigned.

The play is full of music and dance.

As

far as dance is concerned the design must not be
heavy and the complicated set work should be
avoided.

Because of that we have explored the

down stage on the plane ground.

The play is

very flexible and the moves are smooth, :60 r
that a very simple design of set is demonstrated.
