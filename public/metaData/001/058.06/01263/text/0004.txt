which in earlier times used to be called

“Bhagavata Ata”. Originally this form of theatre
dealt with the tales at Krishna but later came to
depict the ten well—known incarnations of Lord
Vishnu. Yakshagana also came to be known as
“Bayalata” as was pertormed in open—air. It is the
special style at music employed in the torm that
gives it this name.
The enacted stories from the Puranas are called
Prasangas and are set to music but without

premeditated dialogues which are always
improvised by actors. Today, about 125 Prasangas
are extant. Yakshagana narrates a given story

through a well—conceived mix at music, dance and
literature. The very backbone of this theatre form is
its operatic nature. The practitioners of the torm
have evolved a rich variety ot costumes and
complex make—up.
