King Bharthari ruled the kingdom of Avantika. He
had three queens Pinglade, Shyamde and
Karnlade. To test his favourite queen Pinglade's
faithfulness he went on a hunt and sent a
messenger to convey the news of his death. On
hearing this Pingla became a "Sati". Meanwhile
the King killed a deer in the forest whose female
companions killed themselves with grief. This
moved the King deeply. Through the magical
powers of Guru Gorakhnath the deer were
brought back to life.
When the King heard of Queen Pingla's self
irnrnolation he returned to the Guru for bringing
her back to life. The boon was granted but it was
a turning point and he took to the life of an ascetic
thereafter.
