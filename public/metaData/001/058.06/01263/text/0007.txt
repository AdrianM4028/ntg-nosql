Therukoothu, which literally means street theatre, is
a popular form of folk theatre from Tamil Nadu. It
is performed throughout the night at the temples,
generally between March and July every year.
Combining spoken word, song and dance, the
artistes enact episodes from Mahabharata and
mythology. Tall headgears, breast shields and
stylized make-u p characterize a Therukoothu
performance. Instruments like the Mridangam,
Mukhaveena and cymbals are used as
accompaniments.
