Rasleela of Mathura and Vrindava n which evolved
in the l 6th century comprises the Rasa dances and
the Leelas —operatic plays —revolving around the
early life of Lord Krishna. The Rasa follows a strict
sequence. It is performed in two related parts. In
the Ras portion Krishna is seen performing his
divine dance with Radha and the Gopis. In the
seCond, Leela, various episodes from Krishna's life

'
are enacted. The enactment is in worship,
profoundly devotional in nature and content.
The performers are known as Rasdharis. Young
boys are trained from a very early age to perform
in this traditional dance-drama. The literary
sources are the Bhagavata Purana, the lyrics of
the Ashtachhaap poets, and the padas of the
Geetagovinda. The music is based on Hindustani
classical ragas and adheres to the traditional
Dhrupad style of rendition.
