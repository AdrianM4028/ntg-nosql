Director ’5 Note
Kavi Dalpatram’s [Witlzyablzimmz is one of
the early modern plays to be written and
produced in the style of Bhavai, the
traditional theatre form of Gujarat. It is a
powerful satire, exposing the hypocracy of
society. Though performed fifty years ago
by Jayashankar Sundari, Mrinalini Sarabhai,
Dina Pathak and Iaswant Thakkar, it is still

relevant. The production becomes still more
relevant with the changing scenario of
contemporary Indian theatre struggling to
establish its identity in the theatre world.

Its presentational style would be an
experience for the audience.

About the Group
The Darpana Academy of Performing Arts
was founded by Mrinalini Sarabhai. It is a
training centre with a research wing, a
library, and a documentation unit. Affiliated

with several Indian and Western
universities, Darpana provides all facilities
for research and training.
