About the Play

Based on Kalidasa’s Ritusamharam, this play
is a description of the Indian cycle of
seasons, portraying the close interaction of
life and nature. Kalidasa writes about the
six seasons — Crishma, Varsha, Sharad,

Hemanta, Shishir, Vasanta — in graphic
detail. He narrates in impeccable manner
the impact of the seasons not only on the
human psyche, but also on insects, flora and
fauna. His poetic images are insightful,
graphic and powerful.
Director ’5 Note
A narrative poem, Ritusamharam is not a

play in the conventional sense. Kalidasa
describes the six seasons in as many
episodes, and they are being presented here

in visual interpretation. Each episode is
complete in itself. There is no tangible story
line and there is no effort to create one.
The performances try to underline the
fact that all human energy is derived from
nature. Now that man is isolating himself
and moving away from nature, he is losing

the power and energy that he derived from
nature. It is a simple expression, through his
own vocabulary, of a director who lives in
the contemporary world. It is that simple.
