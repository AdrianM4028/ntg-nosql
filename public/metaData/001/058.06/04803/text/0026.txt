About the Play

China/7am is a reconstruction of Ramayana
in the folk tradition. Shoorpanakha,
Ravana’s sister, comes to Ayodhya to take
revenge on Rama in the disguise of
Koravanji. She makes Sita draw a portrait of
Ravana, gives life to the portrait, and
disappears. Rama, seeing the portrait,
doubts Sita’s chastity and tries to destroy
Ravana’s image. In the ensuing battle, when
Rama is defeated by the image, Sita asks
Ravana to take birth as her son, as the

portrait is her creation. Tearing up Ravana’s
portrait, she destroys the image.
The Ramayana story, retold in the folk
tradition, depicts the inner conflict of the
human mind and the complexities of human
relations. Sita and Shoorpanakha represent
two facets of womanhood. The conflict

between the two heightens the dramatic
tension in the play. The epic is made
relevant to the present day as the whole
play is an outcome of a modern
consciousness.
