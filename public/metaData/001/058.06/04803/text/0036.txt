About the l’lm‘
A novelist suffering from writer '5 block is
commissioned to write the biography of a
Bollywood filrnstar who has recently and
suddenly and mysteriously disappeared.
Travelling to Delhi, the writer
researches the actor 's roots and early
development. This brings him into contact
with the actor '5 family. his teachers at the
Chamatkara Academy of Acting, his
colleagues in a Mandi House blood-and-guts
theatre group. and his ex-fiancee . . . until
“We packed our passion in a suitcase and set
off to conquer Bollywood."
The action then returns to Mumbai as
the writer traces the actor’s days of struggle

and his meteoric rise to stardom. Slowly but
surely, cracks appear in the image of
success, and when the truth is ultimately

revealed we are shown a life of personal
anguish. loneliness and mental trauma.

Director ’5 Note
Imago Theatre Group is just one year old. It
comprises young actors who have trained at
Imago Acting School and provides them a
platform to apply and develop what they
have learned. The group's motto is New
Plays in New Spaces. since it is dedicated to
experimentation in form and content. to
the creation of original work. and to the
exploration of unconventional performance

spaces.
It’s All About Money, Honey is the

group's first production and, not
surprisingly, grew out of the concerns of the
group about the possibility of making a
career out of acting.
