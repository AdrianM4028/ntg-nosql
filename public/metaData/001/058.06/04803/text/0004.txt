Natya Parva 2002
Intermittently, over the
years of its existence, Sangeet Natale Aleademi has
held major ’expositions’ of contemporary theatre, presenting before audiences
select plays in various languages from various parts of the country. In some
measure, these events have helped to foster a general awareness of the current
theatre, and perhaps to stimulate fresh thin/eing among practitioners of theatre.
Even today, when some amount of theatre can be seen on the small screen, there

can be no substitute for the direct experience of live theatre.
Sangeet Natale Aleademi’s last venture of this leind had been the Nehru
Shatabdi Natya Samaroh held in Delhi in 4989, a ’retrospective’ of significant
plays written and produced between the early 49405 and the mid-49805. While
plays — and therefore playwrights — were the focus ofattention in that event, in
Natya Parva the focus shifts to directors. In both cases, the Sangeet Natale
Aleademi Awards for direction and playwriting remain a criterion for selection of
plays and productions. Of course, as playwriting and directorial sleills are often
combined in individual creators of theatre, in both events we have a fair
sprinleling of playwright-directors.
It is a very diverse fare that Natya Parva holds to view. There are theatrical
reworleings of epic and popular poetry, follelore, and contemporary fiction,renderings of classic plays from Indian and non—Indian sources, seen in a new
light,- original, inventive productions of stories of the directors’ own maleing. A
strong engagement with social and political issues is discernible in many of these
plays, and in some others a groping for a distinctive language of theatre. That is
as should be in an all-India sampling ofour current theatre . . . Are there
directions to be perceived in this body of worle, pointers to the maleing of a new
theatreé Only time can tell ifsome of these trends grow into movements. Suffice it
to say that we have evidence here ofa healthy, living theatre, of creative people
pursuing their dreams in this chosen medium.
No event of this nature can be fully representative of recent worle in every part
of the country, and Natya Parva too does not malee such a claim. For various
reasons, not all the languages and regions that we would have lileed to include in
the event are represented in the final choice ofplays. Nevertheless, the event does

A long way from its base in Delhi, a theatrical event of the size ofNatya
Parva could be organized by Sangeet Natale Aleademi only with the cooperation of
local institutions. In this respect, the Aleademi has been fortunate to receive

unstinted support all along the way from the National Centre for the Performing
