THURSDAY 5 DECEMBER: YLB. CHAVAN CENTRE

Muham'rvun (Marathi)
Play 8! Direction: SATISH ALEKAR
Theatre Academy, Pune
About the Play

Muhum'rvun is a play which deals with the
ultimate taboo, death, a subject of horror,
curiosity and fascination in any culture. In
Hindu culture, death is something not only
tragic but also inauspicious, unmentionable,
not to be discussed, and certainly never to
be joked about.
Muham’rvun breaks the long-standing
Indian theatrical tradition that death should
not be depicted on stage, and with a
mixture of realism, absurdity, song, dance,

and shuddering black humour, confronts the
audience with the actuality of death and
defuses its mystery and horror .

Theatre Academy is presently managed by
Prasad Purandare as Honorary President.
