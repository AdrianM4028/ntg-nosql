SangeetNatakAkademi: An Introduction
Sangeet Natak Akademi — India’s national academy for music, dance and drama —
is the first national academy of the arts set up by the Republic of India. It was
created by a resolution of the (then) Ministry of Education, Government of India,

dated 31 May 1952, which was notified in the Gazette oflna’ia of June 1952. This
resolution aimed at establishing an institution which would provide a unified
structure of support for the practice of the performing arts. The Akademi became
functional the following year, with the appointment of its first Chairman, Dr RV.
Rajamannar, and the formation of its all-India council of representatives, the
General Council. The first President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad, inaugurated it on
se.

school trained students — as it still does — in practical and theoretical aspects of

theatre, preparing them for careers in the theatrical arts. The National School of
Drama separated from Sangeet Natak Akademi in 1975, and became an autonomous
teaching institution.
Sangeet Natak Akademi is at present an Autonomous Body under the Ministry

of Tourism and Culture, Government of India, and is fully funded by the
Government for implementation of its schemes and programmes.
