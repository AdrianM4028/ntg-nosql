About the Play

Munshi Khan, a Muslim, did not go to
Pakistan at the time of Partition and stays

with a Sikh family as a family member. This
is not acceptable to others in the village and
they compel Munshi Khan to change his
religion. He succumbs to the pressure and
converts to Sikhism.
Inside the house, he is free to perform
all rituals and prayers according to his own

religion. A retired Subedar of the village
knows this. After the death of Munshi Khan
the Subedar insists on all final rites for
Munshi Khan according to Islam. A few
persons, both Hindus and Muslims, resent
this but the Subedar tells them about the
wishes of Munshi Khan. Ultimately, good
sense prevails.
Director â€™5 Note
The play is a piece of rural theatre with a
modern sensibility. Drama is my passion

and my object is to use this medium for the
betterment of mankind. I always lay my
hands on problems which are being faced by
mankind. I try to focus on the contour and
character of contemporary society,
exploring its strengths and weaknesses.
Natale Munshi Khan Da was written by me
in 1991 and shows the pains and sufferings
of the common man after Partition divided
India in 1947.
