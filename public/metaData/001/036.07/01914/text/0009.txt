ACTS VI, VII & VIII (our Act V)
Vasantasena and her Cheti are at Charudatta’s house. Vasantasena
is to go and join Charudatta in a park. Radanika comes along with
Charudatta’s son Rohasena, who wants to play with a gold cart and
throws the clay cart away. Vasantasena gives him her ornaments to
make a gold cart to play with. By mistake she gets into Shakara’s
coach and reaches Shakara’s park. Shakara tries to court her, but she
spurns him. He is angry and in revenge strangles her, keeps her
covered with leaves of trees and goes away. A wandering Monk, the
former Samvahaka, rescues Vasantasena who has been merely under
a swoon.
Act IX (our Act VI)
Shakara goes to the Court of Justice to accuse Charudatta as the

murderer of Vasantasena. It so happens that Charudatta’s luck fails
him miserably, and the evidence goes against him and he is sentenced
to death.
Act X (our Act VII)
Charudattta is about to be beheaded when Vasantasena. arrives.
Charudatta’s innocence is amply proved.

Magnanimous that he is,

he lets Shakara free. In the meantime, King Palaka is killed and
Aryaka is crowned. Sharvilaka announces this happy tidings and all

is well again while the play ends with the Bharatavakya.
