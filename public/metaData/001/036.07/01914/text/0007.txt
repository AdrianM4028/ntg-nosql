SHUDRAKA
AS THE CURTAIN GOES UP
ACT I
AFTER THE traditional benedictory prayers and the dialogue between
the Sutradhara and the Nati, the play proper commences with Maitreya

deploring the state of affairs he has reached owing to Charudatta’s
poverty. Once surrounded by opulence, Charudatta—the Hero—has
fallen on evil days because of his lavish generosity, and is desperate

in his new circumstances, swearing at the accursed poverty. The
following scene opens with the chase of Vasantasena by Shakara—the
King’s brother-in-law, Vita and the Cheta, his associates. She
eventually escapes by entering Charudatta’s house when it grows dark.
Vasantasena is in love with Charudatta and is pleased to meet him.
She deposits her jewellery in his house to avoid trouble but actually
ﬁnding an indirect yet a clever excuse for a reunion.
ACT 11
Acts 11 begins with a road-side brawl between three gamblers
Samvahaka, who has lost in the game takes resort in Vasantasena‘s
house, where Vasantasena and Madanika, her friend, are having
a conﬁdential conversation, wherein Vasantasena expresses her feelings
towards Charudatta. Samvahaka rushes into the room asking for help.
On knowing that he has been a servant in Charudatta’s household he
gets a cordial reception. Vasantasena relieves him by paying his debit
to the gamblers, but refuses to accept his service. Consequently he
decides to become a monk.
