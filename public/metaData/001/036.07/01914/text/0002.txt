TRHARIYAM
BY
V D. GANGAL, I.A.S.

A SUMMARY OF THE PLAY
AFTER THE benediction, the Stage Manager (Sutradhara) enters
and
explains to his wife (Nati) the subject matter of the new
play which is

proposed to be staged. He says that the play deals
with the life of
the poet king Bhartrhari and with transformation of the
king’s mind
from equity (Niti) to romance (Sringara) and therefrom
to despondency
(Vairagya). He also refers to the story introduced
by the author of a

magic fruit which was capable of conferring eternal
life on one who
ate it but which, curiously enough, no one consumed !
In the ﬁrst Act we ﬁnd that King Bhartrhari has just
ﬁnished
a successful campaign against the evil Kosala. He is in conve
rsation
with the jester on the bank of river Sarayu. While he
is also giving
appropriate instructions which would mitigate the
hardship caused
to his subjects by the recent war, a Brahmin is introduced
on the stage.
The latter wants to present a magic fruit (Amara
Phala) to the king

so that King Bhartrhari would become immortal. The
King graciously
declines to take it but is persuaded later to accept
it. While he is
wondering whether he should eat it or share
it with his queen (Pingala)

whom he loved dearly, the Army Chief (Bhadramuk
ha) comes in and
tells the story of a pretty young woman (Vipasa) who was
caught while

attempting to commit suicide.

She is the daughter of the defeated

Kosala’s General, and is now disgusted with her life
since all her near
and dear once are slain by Bhartrhari’s forces. The King’
s words of
assurance have the desired effect and she has agreed to
go with the
King to his Capital. But in the meantime, Bhartrhari
is struck ﬁrst
by her exceptional beauty and then by love and his
friend Vasantaka

rightly remarks that the author of Niti-Sataka has
forgotten himself
and has plunged headlong into Sringara (Romance).
The King is none
the sorry for his transformation. Here ends the
ﬁrst Act.
