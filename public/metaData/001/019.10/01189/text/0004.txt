CHILDREN THEATRE FESTIVAL - 95
We started regular children theatre with
the production of 'Mere Hlsse Ki Dhoo
Kahan HaiKNatrang later roduced 'Aa

Hamare Hain Kaun', Bada de Rang', 'Aaj
Ki Aurat', 'Hamein Jawab Do', 'Khel
Khilonon Ka Sansar', 'Bhag Beta Bhag',

'Jaan Bacchi To Lakhon Payae and
'Charan Dass Chor' all by children.
Ours is perhaps the only theatre group in
the country which is performing regular
children theatre. Over sixty shows of one
play 'Mere Hisse Ki Dhoop Kahan Hai'
ave been performed in Jammu and outside in Patiala, Delhi, Chandigarh and
Hyderabad which is a record in itself. With
the establishment of strong foundation
of childrens Theatre in Jammu we foresee a new hope for theatre in our region.
In establishing a solid base for children
theatre, we are also in the process of

evolving a new methodology for the train—
ing of young actors. The idea ।प्त also to
search out a new language for theatre
expressed through various poetic visu—
als and images.
In search of our ultimate goal we have a
long way to go but we are satisﬁed that
a good beginning has been made. I am
grateful to all who have contributed their
best efforts to make this event more
meaningful
