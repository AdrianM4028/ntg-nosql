Hardly a hundred days ago we formed this amateur dramatic group

about
ourselves

in this city. Since its inception we have tried to live up to the aims and
ideals we have set before ourselves.
Any accidental observer in the South of this great country can ﬁnd
numerous organisations trying to represent the rich and varied cultural life
of our peninsula. But the people in these parts do not have much chances of
understanding or appreciating the artistic and dramatic traditions of the South.
We do recognise our limitations in this stupendous task of presenting any play.
But as an enlightened audience we hope you would appreciate our efforts and
njoy what is good and give us your advice and suggestions to lead us to the
cal which we have set before us.

We presented our ﬁrst play ‘Natakam’ in the ﬁrst week of septemb er
subsequently the “Pellichupulu” “Guddilokam” and “Venkanna Kapuram”
were staged during the month of October. These plays were well received ‘

and it gave us such a conﬁdence that we have become bold ezéough to
present this “Akasaramanna” now. We can certainly regard this "Akasa—
ramanna’ as a culmination for the present efforts to produce a full length "
ﬁve act drama.
One among many of our objectives is that the best dramatic achievements in the South be rendered in Hindi and it is also proposed to render
Hindi plays in South Indian languages. This will necessarily provide a plat—

form for the display the varities of the varied but rich cultures of the
two parts that is North and South.
It is hoped you will extend your wllling co-operation and your kind

I patronage, will help this infant grow up into a mature and sturdy organisation.
