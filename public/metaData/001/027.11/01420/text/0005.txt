good and excusing any inconsistencies and in completeness in our attempt.

Lastly I wish to place on record my profound thankfulness and gratLtude for the co-operation and helping hand of all those who helpe
d me to
present this programme. But for the comperation and helping hand of
all those

tly helped

The play would run for approximately two hours and fifteen minutes.
There are ﬁve scenes.
