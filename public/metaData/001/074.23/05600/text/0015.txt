utmost remorse. In the same way, in UttarRamacharitam, when Lawa does
not even histate to use Jrimb/za/raszra
to paralyse the entire army of Clzamlraketu,
he is under the pressu of agony and

ill-feeling which prompts him to use
such words for Rama which he ought
not to have uttered. And again when
realisation dawns upon him. he regrets the
violence that he perpetrated mentally and
physically also. And what did Vanadevi
Vasanti do when she attacked Rama with
scant reSpect for his utOpian sense of duty
and called him Yasha Lab/1i. She also had
the same self-realisation. In my designing of
the play, therefore. I have projected these

scenes with conspicuous overtones almost to
the level of larger-than-life-size-melodrama
to drive home the thematic urge of both the

play s.

In to-day’s world torn with violence, if
humanity has to be saved from the clutches of
insanity which is chasing nations beyond the

precipice, into the all pervading darkness of
selflanhiliation, let us declare in one voice
that violence has, and shall never have any
place whatsoever in human life.
