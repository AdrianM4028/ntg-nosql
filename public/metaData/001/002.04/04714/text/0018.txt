Sri Veera Brahmamgari Jeevitha Charithra
The play drarnatises Brahmamji’s miraculous acts, among
which is the act of Brahmamji preaching ‘absolute
wisdom’ to Kakkadu through Kakkudu’s wife’s dead body.
Siddhaiah has complete submission for his Guru. So,
before Brahmamji takes Samaadki, he sends Siddhaiah
to fetch ﬂowers from the forest so that he is spared of the
pain of separation. Later, he reappears to give his blessing
to his disciple.

Lord Vishnu takes incarnation as Veera Brahmam with
the purpose of showing people the right path, in the
age of Kalyug. Veera Brahmam is born as the child of
Paripoorancharyulu and Prakruthamba but he is brought
up by Veerabhojacharyulu and Veera Pavulamba in
Banagana I’alle Village. He spends his childhood guarding
the cowherd and meditating in the hill caves, predicting
future. With the passing of time, Veera Brahrnam marries

Govindamma and they have two sons. Brahmamji
continues predicting future and showing miracles. Some
people, who became envious of his powers, complain to
the Sultan. Brahmamj i then goes to meet the Sultan with
his Muslim disciple Siddhaiah, where he is made to go
through some tests. During these tests, Brahmamji shows
some of his miraculous acts. This makes the Sultan also a
disciple of Veera Brahrnam.
