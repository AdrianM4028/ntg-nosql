inﬂuenced by colonial India’s modern popular imagery
that emanated from the pedagogy of the colonial art
school that put value on perspective, and from the
arrival of the techniques of engraving, lithography, and
oleography leading to mass— production and circulation

ofillusionistic pictures [2].
The enactment of mythological characters and situations
such as depiction ofVasudeva carrying Lord Krishna
across Yamuna or Krishna taming the ﬁve—headed serpent
Ka/z'ya or the killing ofKamsa on the stage requires
eﬂective theatrical paraphernalia — an art that the Surabhi
theatre group is famed for.
The Surabhi family travels with its stagecraft, extravagant

backdrops, stage and auditorium construction material
to different locations for performances. As in the case
ofI’arsi Theatre, the Surabhi curtains include paintings
depicting forests, heaven, gardens, modern streets,
palaces/durbars, antabapuras (royal women’s quarters), or
a cave scene as in the Surabhi play Maya Bazaar.
In a repertory spanning over a century and quarter, Maya
Bazaar; Sri/erz'x/malee/alu, Balanagamma, C/Jz'm'amazzz', and
SatiAnasuya have been amongst their most prominent
plays. The ﬁrst Telugu talkie, B/Jakt'a Pra/alada in 1931
using Surabhi actors cinematised their mythological
production verbatim. These actors also performed in the
ﬁrst Tamil talkie, Ka/ia’asa in 1931.
