Hiranyakashyapa. the Rakshasa king wants to kill Lord

Vishnu, his rival. Hiranyakashyapa had won a boon that
he couldn’t be killed by any weapon; by any human or
animal; on land or water and at day or night. With the
help of such a powerful boon, he defeated Devendra,
made the ashtadikpalakas his servants and propagated

himself as God.
Due to Narada, the son of King Hiranyakashyapa,
Prahlaada is born with prenatal wisdom and devotion

for Lord Vishnu. Hiranyakashyapa tries to change him
first with love and with fearful punishments. Prahlaada
is thrown from the hill, pushed into ﬁre, thrown into the
seas, thrown in front of violent elephants, hanged and

poisoned. But Prahlaada refuses to give up his bhakthi for
Lord Vishnu.
