Thoda Rumudu, a garderner’s son loves Indurnathi, the

only daughter of the king of Ujjaini. The king rejects
their love but gives Rumudu an option that ifRumudu
earns a lot of money, he can marry his daughter.
To obtain evil spirits, Manm’k Nepala needed a good,
bold and young man. He ﬁnds out about Thoda Ramudu
and brings him for this purpose, promising him the
wealth which he needs to marry Indumathi. Just before
the prayers, 'Ihoda Rarnudu ﬁnds out about the Mantri/e’:
evil intentions. He gets the evil spirit to kill the Mantri/e
and marries Indumathi.
The disciple of the Manm'k comes to know about this.
He returns his master’s life with the help ofsanjeevmzi.
Mmztri/z obtains the idol ofthe evil spirit through cheap
tricks and kidnaps Indumathi.
