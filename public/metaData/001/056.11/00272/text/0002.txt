SABRANG, The Theatre Group

Though there are a number of theatre groups in Delhi, they hardly
provide the kind and amount of theatrical activity a city should have, nor
do they provide a platform to all the young and serious talent emerging
from the University and the National school of drama.

With their problems, and the immense possibilities of untapped
sources in mind, ’SABRANG’, the theatre group has been formed —- opening its doors not only to the groups mentioned above but hoping to involve
young talents in other art forms : painting, music, poetry and dance.
SABRANG already has as members, young contemporary writers for whom
we hope to create circumstances for evolving new and experimental plays
in diverse forms.

We are a politically and socially conscious group, but we owe no
allegiance to any particular political party. As such, our supreme aim is
to present theatre which is vital and meaningful, relevant and related to
the problems of our audience and society.

We want to perform in any Indian language, though our emphasis
will be on Hindi and Punjabi — drawing plays from contemporary Indian
writers and indigenous as well as foreign sources. The emphasis again
is on what is vital and what is meaningful to our audience.
We will perform not only in urban theatre halls but carry our plays to
Colleges and Universities, the suburbs and community halls. We hope
also to sponsor worthwhile shows from outside Delhi —~ especially of
young emerging groups.

Finally, we hope to evolve into a regular professional repertory group
