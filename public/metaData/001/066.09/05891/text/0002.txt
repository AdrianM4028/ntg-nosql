Au R TOTA BO‘LA
Aur Tota Bola is a Revolutionary Play written in
Cannarese by Chandra Shekhar Kambar. It is about

a God called Jog Kurnar Swaini’. Yet it's not about
the God. It's about you and me and our problems
in the Socio-Sexio-Psychological relationships that
we live in our everyday lives. The action in the play
is self-explanatory and any more explanations and

elucidations on my part would‘be pointless.
Suffice it to say that this has been one of the most
exciting plays that I have been involved with in the
recent past. And I doubt that l-will be involved with
anything more exciting than this in the near future.
