S HAHJAHAN
by D. L. Roy
Sunday. 8th November 1964

We are presenting another classical historical drama by the
name ofSHAHjAHAN from the pen of the famous poet and playwright
D. L. ROY.

It cannot be claimed that history has been religiously followed in this
drama in which it has been shown the dramatic coup d’etat of the throne
of Delhi by Aurengzeb after clever and cunning manoeuvring of his
brothers who stood in his way for occupying the throne. SHAHjAHAN was
dethroned and was virtually imprisoned in Agra Fort.
The drama evolves a gripping melodrama and the actors get ample
oportunities of showing their histrionic abilities.
