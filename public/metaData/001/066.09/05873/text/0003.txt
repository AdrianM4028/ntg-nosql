FOREWORD

Our

moto

is

to

stage

theatrical

performances

successfully and

competently and with this idea NANDANIK was established by a handful of
young boys in the year 1960.

The inaugural performance was NACHER PUTUL, an adaptation
from Vicky Baum’s “Grand Hotel” held in Mahajati Sadan. Calcutta. The
performance was a success and the critics appreciated the bold attempt and
praised our venture.
'

Later. some veterans joined our team

and it was decided to hold

SISIR SMARANUTSAB in commemoration of the memory of late
Natyacharyya Sisir Kumar Bhadury and in the year 1961 we staged three
dramas in which the late Natyacharyya showed his prowess. The festival
was a grand success and letters, praises and favourable criticisms in weekly
and daily papers adorned our venture.

We were invited on many occasions by the Biswaroopa Natyaunnayan
Parikalpana Parishad for the presentation of classical dramas.

Our

latest

productions

based

on 0

popular

film

crime

thrillers

“DIAL M FOR MURDER” and “CHASE OF A CROOKED SHADOW”
have been well appreciated by the audience. We are looking for a permanent
stage in Calcutta where these dramas along with other classical dramas can
be presented regularly every week-ends.

We have been very successful in Drama Competitions.

In fact there

is hardly a competition in West Bengal in which we have not scored a prize.

We hope our performances will be appreciated by Delhi audience.
