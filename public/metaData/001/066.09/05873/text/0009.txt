by Late D. L. Roy

Saturday 7th. November 1964

A glorious chapter of the history of the Hindu kingdom is unfolded in this
drama CHANDRAGUPTA written by the famous poet and playwright
D. L. Roy.

In this drama the early struggles of Chandragupta, the fonder of Mayuryya
Empire have been depicted.
Chandragupta came in touch with the famous politician Chanakyya (Kauttillya) and with his help and guidance defeated his step-brother NANDA
and occupied the throne of his father Mahapadma.

Chandragupta also defeated the Greeks who invaded his kingdom and
married a Grecian girl by the name of Helen.

Howfar the facts presented

in this drama are historically true, we do not know but it shows
valour of a Hindu king.
