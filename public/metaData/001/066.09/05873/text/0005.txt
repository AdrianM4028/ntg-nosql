PRAFULLA
By Late Mahakavi Girish Chandra

Thursday, 5th November.

I964

PRAFULLA is the immortal tragedy of late Mahakavi Girish Chandra.

It

was first staged in the year 1889 but even now the drama moves the audience
with its tragic appeal.

PRAFULLA is a tale of a joint Bengali family where the eldest brother
JOGESH was the breadwinner and the entire family responsibility was

vested on him.

A misfortune engulfed the family and the conniving second

brother RAMESH had the entire family assets transferred in his name and
drove away the elder brother and his family 'from the home. RAMESH
also managed to put his younger brother SURESH into jail by false
implication.
'
Many tragic incidents happened and the eldest brother became very much

addicted to drinks to forget his misery and the entire family was ruined.
RAMESH commits crimes one after another and is ultinately taken into

custody when in a fit of anger he kills his own wife PRAFULLA.
A prosperous and happy family was completely mine 1 and destructed.

The last utterance of JOGESH “ah mar sagono bagan sukea galo” will bring
tears even in the eyes of the stonehearted
