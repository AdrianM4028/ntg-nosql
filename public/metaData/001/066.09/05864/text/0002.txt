There cannot be a meeting
point of one’s desire and
what one gets. The desire
does not get satisfied even
after meeting, what one
desires. Even if one meets one’s
God, the desire still remains.
Deben babu desires to let
out a flat. Bijay desires to
hire a flat, Kanika desires
something. and so does
Subha. Do their desires get
satisfied ’? The play weaves

these different desires

amidst comical and hilarious
situations.
