SYNOPSIS

The King of an imaginary country is going through a
grave crisisé there are cracks in the wall, thunder is
stuck in the sky and

the polytechnic has vanished through

a hole in the ground.

He is informed that he has an hour and a
half to live and will not outlive the play. He has two wives
of whom he loves the younger Ratnavali who wants to provide
him with hope and hide the truth from him° But the older
queen Mayurakshi attempts to reconcile him to his death°

In order to renaffirm his power in the kingdom, the
King gives orders but they are not obeyedo
and his rebellious cries alternate with

Fear seizes him

supplications.

In the different stages of renunciation that follow there
is fear, a desire to survive, nostalgia, memories °°°°°°then

at last, bereft of all, he begins to speak:
the pasta He slowly begins
little he becomes the

of himself as in

to accept death and little by

symbol of the reign of man on earth

and of human destiny.
