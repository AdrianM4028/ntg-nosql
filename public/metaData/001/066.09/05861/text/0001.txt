MALINI - Rabindra Nath Thakur.

In these terror-stricken times, this atmOSphere of the
erosion of the self, of evil rampant, the graveyard is
gradually usurping the land of India. Communalism has
displaced Religion; killing, instead of salvaging the
human soul.

The darkness of the medival ages pervades

our minds.

Through his play Mglini, Rahindranath has creatively
'suggested a way to dispel this spiritual darkness. In
his unidue expression, Religion_is note mere caudlestcik,

but the light itself; one cannot thrust daylight out by
main.force'.

The dramatic crisis in the play grows intense when we
see an Everlasting Nay enthroned in the heart of

Kshemankar. He will not allOw Kashi (the city of Varanasi)

an initiation into the new humanistic religion. He will
not adult Eyeryman through the barred gates of his temple

of darkness; nor let the call of the wide world and the

vibrations of life penitrate into the Cloistered darkess
that is his own. But in Malini, the Princessn of Kashi,
Religion has already transmuted itself into an expression'
of the all-pervasive good and of love towards mankind.
Supriyo also has striven'to bring light into the dark

temple, has sought the meaning of life in close communion

with man and tfe earth - away from a tempting and elusive
Heaven.

On one hand there is the new humanistic religion of Malini;

on the other Supriyos trust and dependence on Kshemankar,
