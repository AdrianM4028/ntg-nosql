THE IMAGINARY INVALID by MOLIERE
This is Moliere’s last play, a farce in prose with music
and dance, written when the author himself was ill.
A satirical caricature on the practice of medicine. The
Imaginary Invalid is, above all, the potrait of a ridiculous

egotist who lives in a world of illusion.

In order to obtain the constant medical attention he
craves, the hypochondriac Argan, is determined to marry

his daughter Angelique to Thomas Diafoirus, a pedantic
medical student, but Angelique encouraged by her uncle
Beralde and by her clever servant Toinette, is in love
with Cleante. Her stepmother Beline who flatters Argan
with loving attentions but is really interested only in his
making a will in her favour, gives Angelique no help and
actually hopes to force her into a convent to eliminate
her claim to her father’s property.

Beralde and Toinette concoct a play to expose Beline’s
cupidity and remind Argan of his daughter’s devotion.
They are able to induce the credulous hypochondriac to
feign death in order to prove his wife’s affections.
When Argan is ”dying” he hears for himself his wife’s
rejoicing and his daughter’s grief. The ”Invalid” consents
to let Angelique marry Cleante on the condition that
Cleante become a Doctor. Cleante agrees, but then
Argan decides that he will take up the medical profession
himself and minister to his own needs.

P R E S S REFLECTIONS

”Naseeruddin Shah was expectedly the master of the
evening. It was a most immaculate performance. The play
makes its point with brevity and wit and is therefore ideal

”The Imaginary Invalid is a grand theatre entertainment
with an intellectual appeal. Naseer shines in it and in the
title role brings out the quintessence of the character”.

The play is guaranteed to keep you in splits throughout
its duration. The period costumes, the humour, the
performances … they are simply par excellence.
