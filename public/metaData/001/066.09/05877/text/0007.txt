SYNOPSlS 0i MRKCHAKATIK

Charudatta, the recently impoverished Brahrnin merchant of Ujjaini falls in love at first
sight with Vasantasena, the eminent danseuse. Vasantasena too readily reciprocates.
Thus develops an uneven love between a noble man and a court dancer. But the
romance between Charudatta and Vasantasena does not go without worries. Shakar, a
brother-in-law of the king has an eye for Vasantasena, and the damsel has to be constantly
contriving one way out or another to keep off his voluptuous grip.

Parallel to this romantic plot runs another plot where the citizens, distressed at the
tormenting rule of the king prepare surreptitiously for a rebellion, and as soon as they
succeed in freeing the leader Aryak from the dungeon of the king, have recourse
to an open revolt. As a result the king is dethroned, and beheaded. Aryak is coronated
by the people as the new king.
In the meantime Shakar has strangled Vasantasena to death after having failed to win
her over, and has craftily put the blame of murder on to Charudatta. At the execution
ground Vasantasena arrives just at the nick to save Charudatta from imminent death.
After having been left as dead by Shakar she was nursed to life by a Buddhist monk
who had been indebted to her. All gloom diSpelled, Charudatta is elevated to royalty,

and at the request of the king Aryak, he accepts Vasantasena as his wife.
