About KAlYAlll KALA KENDRA
INDIA has an unbroken history of rich civilization spanning over five millennia. During
this period her intellectual depths and spiritual heights have built up a gloriously
rich heritage in art and culture, in different fields of human endeavour and activity.
It is sad, but true, that the people in other lands have had a greater awareness and
appreciation of rich mosaic of lndia's history and culture than her own people.
Foriegners, pilgrims and students have been coming to India to learn about and from
her, while her own people have remained unaware of its priceless assests. Efforts to

educate Indians in this direction and to inculcate among them a spirit of awareness and
appreciation are being made and with this end

in view, a few dedicated young men

came together and founded Kalyani Kala Kendra in August 1968.

The Kendra takes pride in reviewing its past performances since its inception.
Over hundred cultural programmes were organized wherein country’s all leading figures
in the field of dance, drama and music were presented.
It would not be out of the place to mention here that the Kendra is the
pioneers in reviving the time honoured Baithak style placing the audience at a close
distance popularly known as Mehfil.
