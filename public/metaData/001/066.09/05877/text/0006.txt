By now, Dr. Brijmohan Bajaj, a medico with a yen and knowledge of culture that
would beat many a professional cultural expert, is a well-known figure among Delhi’s

attention of the houses culture. Jameel Ahmed impressed instantly for his gift of a
fine musical voice coupled with a deeper insight into the demands of the ghazal form.

rendition that owes little to the manner of a Mehdi Hassan, Chandra Mohan's accompaniment on the tabla was excellent.
