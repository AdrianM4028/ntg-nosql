The Kendra has embarked on such programmes as providing help to slum dwellers
by offering them medical aid, books and giving them civic education. ' Members of the
Kendra have actively participated in raising adequate funds to build a charitable
Hospital of 16 beds with operation theatre and research facility. The hospital has been
named as “Roshanlal Bajaj Memorial Hospital Er Medical Research Institute".
Few other such projects are in the offing.

The members of the Kendra are determined to make it a dynamic and progressive
organisation. It's success, however, depends upon the kind and continued patronage
of well-wishers.

All our patrons and well-wishers are invited to play an active role in our cultural
life by enrolling themselves as members of the Kendra and in continuing to encourange
it by patronising its activities, performances and projects.

PRESS COMMENTS
——Kalyani Kala Kendra may appear to be yet another name in the ever proliferating
directory of capital's cultural groups. But it possesses one ingredient that many of the
others lack and without which it is impossible to have a live cultural group—dynamic

irnpresario at the helm of affairs.

Founded in 1968, the group has done very well for itself by constantly bringing
on the public platform, in informal "mehfil" type soirees, as well as formal concerts, a
varied assortment of artist. Dr. Bajaj, who runs it with a degree of love and enthusiasm
rare for a rnedico, has all kinds of plans for the Kendra. Having seen too many groups
and societies of this kind settle inevitably into a moribund kind of laissez faire, we can
only say a fervent "amen" to Dr. Bajaj plans.
