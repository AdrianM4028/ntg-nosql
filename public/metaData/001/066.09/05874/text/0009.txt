PADMA-GANGA UTSAV
Though whole-heartedly engaged in the cultivation of
dramatic art, NANDIPAT is also alive to the goings-on
in
other fields of culture. NANDIPAT feels that an excha
nge

painting, film is a must to make the cultivation
meaningful. PADMAâ€”GANGA UTSAV is a natural fall o
ut
of the same.
