A 40—year old smart, successful man suspects
suddenly that the 24—year old woman he
married after a prolonged courtship as having
an affair and he appoints a private detective
to tail her. The truth, as revealed in this
adaptation from Peter Shaffer’s “The Public Eye"
is less attractive than the fiction.
