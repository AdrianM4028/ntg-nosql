An artist thInks aloud

It IS more—than-a hundred year-story. ThIs may
appear insignificant in terms of time, but in the
history of Bengali theatre it takes a collosal shape.
Numerous plays. dramatists, producers, actors,
technicians flooded the Bengali stage. Some of
them are legends today. Some, legends as they have
become while alive are again on the point of
creating history. Those who will write the history of
the present and ,the generation to come, have
neither‘ seen nor heard about the activities of the
great men of the theatre of the past‘. I felt it to be a
sacred responsibility to make the new generation
familiar with their achievements. The concept of
painting of this pictorial history of theatre
personalities from Lebedeff to the present day is
born out of such desire. This painting exhibitiOn in '
the Padma Ganga festival organised by Nandipat
has been done within a very short time Errors may
be there despite our earnest efforts, hope theatre
lovers and theatre— historians will point those out to
enrich our knowledge of theatre-history. I' dream of
making an album of this highly expensive creation
which will sink into futility without the valuable co—
operation of the theatre lovers.
