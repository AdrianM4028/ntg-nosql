A NA N D l PAT STORY
On 18th September, 1979 … 8 bunch of youth, with a view
to nourishing them aesthetically, seeing the life in a
positive light, analysing and evaluating the cause and
effect of different social complexities — formed

NANDIPAT at Belghoria and went on working and
enriching the “Art of Theatre" to their best.
By 1988-89 8 new wave expanded the horizon in
cultivating theatre and its allied art forms. There was a
notable change of attitude not only to find out the “here
and now” of theatre but 8 scientific attitude leading to an
all-round professional attitude grew up gradually.

NANDIPAT has enacted twenty four plays, one-act and
full—fledged included, in and outside the state. They
believe in fraternity and are respectful for national and
international traditions of art and culture.

With success and failure in productions and activities
outside its periphery, these young men have always
remained alive and responsive to their social callings.
They, to whom success and failure are of no importance,
are only engaged for the good of theatre — they are
named NANDIPAT.
