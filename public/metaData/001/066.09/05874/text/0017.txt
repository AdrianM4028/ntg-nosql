The Dewan of Gazipur, a powerful jotedar, is
altogether a different man under the influence of
liquor. His servants become his closest companions
and he would rather have the rickshawpuller
Makhan than the police inspector as his son—in-law.
But his great love for the poor disappears as soon

as he recovers from his intoxication. Makhan
discovers the cruel jotedar that the Dewan actually
is on the night of his daughter’s wedding,
Gazisaheb gets drunk again and drives the police
inspector out. But Makhan also leaves. He is not
going to make another mistake in recognizing the
real Dewan, or in beliving that the rich can ever get
close to the poor.
