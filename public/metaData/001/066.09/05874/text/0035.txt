agreement with 95-year old Banchha to the
effect that he will get an allowance of
Rs.200/- per month till death. After his death
the Zeminder’s son will be the proprietor of
the garden but Banchha gets a fresh life.., His
near and dear ones do not want him to die as
they cannot survive without him. In this
dilemma of to be or not to be a strange drama
of greed, jealousy, suspicion and love is
enacted round him.
