VST AND THE PERFORMING ARTS

Some years ago, VST Industries Ltd. took a conscious decision
to promote and encourage the performing arts as a part of its
over-all Corporate Commitment. Today the Company is in the
forefront of corporate sponsorship in this area.
VST has helped in forming Natya Samhati —- a new-born
forum for the Theatre workers of West Bengal. They have
extended all sorts of co operation in holding the Theatre Festival
in Calcutta in memory of Late Debasish Dasgupta and recently
VST has sponsored a film retrospective featuring Utpal Dutta at
Nandan under.the auspices of Natya Sanhati. Besides. it has
also come forward in sponsoring different dramatic and cultural
festivals organised by the noted organisers of the city. The
theatre festivals sponsored by VST, every year under the banner
of “Mini Natya Utsav" have stolen the heart of the Cultureloving people of West Bengal.

VST hopes to sustain its relation with the Cultural activities
meaningfully not only as a business irnpressario but with a
noble mission to srnoothen the flow of | Culture.
