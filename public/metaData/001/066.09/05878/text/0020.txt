The defeated Siraj comes back to the capital, a broken man.

He makes

frantic efforts to secure men and arms with which to recover his lost kingdom but

gets little response. Meanwhile, his enemies close in upon him and he is forced to
ﬂee the capital along with his wife, Lutf'a.
On reaching Murshidabad the enemies
imprison Ghulam Hussain and Aleya and subject them to severe torture. This
wretched pair whom the days of adversity have brought closer to each other than
ever before face all these sufferings without giving out any news about the fugitive
Nawab. But the enemies are hot on his trail and soon effect his capture. Siraj is
brought back to the capital as a prisoner and the curtain is above to ring down on

his brief but hectic career.

Plassey which sealed his and

his country’s fate has

ever since become a symbol of a nation’s depravity and a grim reminder to posterity to be wary of self-seekers in times of national crisis.
