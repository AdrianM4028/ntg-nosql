Nawab.

Her

She is sore about the succession

having devolved upon Siraj instead of her own adopted son. She is also obsessed
by the fear that her wealth would be appropriated by Siraj and put to his own use.

Hemmed in with intrigues on all sides, Siraj acts with commendable
shrewdness and daring. He persuades Ghaseti Bugum to come and live in the
Nawab’s own palace to be attended upon with all the respect and ceremony beﬁtting
her status but kept secure from the inﬂuence of scheming people. Then getting
wind of some trouble brewing at the English factory at Cossimbazar where some
leading cnnspirators had assembled to chalk out a plan of action for his overthrow
he swoops down on this spot with his troops and takes into custody the chief of
the factory, Mr. Watts, along with other inmates.

Siraj next proceeds to Calcutta

to carry out a successful raid on the English who had been strengthening their forti-

ﬁcations in the city in open deﬁance of his orders.
Furthervevidence of Watts’ treasonous activities comes to light and he is
expelled from the Nawab’s Court.

Aleya has successfully intercepted a letter from

Watts to Mir Jafar, Commander of thc Nawab’s armed forces, which reveals that
even this senior ofﬁcer is involved in intrigues. The large-hearted Siraj is, however.
willing to forgive all these serious lapses of his trusted servants for he knows that

a ﬁnal trial of strength with the English forces under the leadership of Clive is
imminent and givis a stirring call to them all to stand united and meet this challenge
to their country’s freedom. So impassioned is his appeal that the chiefs who had
so far been hovering between duty and self-advancement are deeply moved and
eagerly come forward to offer their services.
