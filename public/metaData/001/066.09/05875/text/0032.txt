The other party, spear-headed by those not-too-many who are conversant with trends in regional theatre movements, and are particularly associated with one or the other small institutions at the national level, holds
that

the

search

of the

local regional units is not so over-powering as to

preclude the quest for realisation of the concept of an Indian theatre, per se.
There is no denying that in all spheres of activities—~cultural, religious,
social, economic—the trend is towards the bigger ideal of “lndianness” and
institutionalise the same, as far as possible keeping in view the‘sentiments
and aspirations of distinctive communities.
