Friends, a few vvrods

1967 - Nineteen hundred and seventy eight, Agragami has
travelled in all these eleven years a distance so very little but

surely and certainly in a path of deﬁnite aim. This journey, though
not very smooth, as it is with many a amateur theatre unit, has
helped us to acclamatize ourselves with the rough weather. With
the induction of a band of energetic and enthusiastic young
men and women, Agragarni will march ahead with undaunted
spirit and vigour.

1978 - for us has been a year of successes. In February, we parti—
cipated in the l lth All India Short play competition, Allahabad with
Ashit Bosu’s —- ‘Kolkatar Hamlet’ and bagged the ‘President’s
Award’ for production and a Certiﬁcate of Merit for Direction.
In March, we took part in the 4th All India Drama Competition at
Chandigarh, with the same play, and had the distinction of bagging
Best Direction, 2nd
four coVeted awards, the Best Production,
Best Actor, 3rd Best Actress with an unqualiﬁed acclaim from
the theatre lovers.

Today we, present to the theatre lovers of Delhi, one of the
Calcutta’s most progressive theatre unit, Nandikar who will be
performing two famous plays, Football and Khorir Gondi.
The devastating ﬂash ﬂoods which have caused havoc in West
Bengal, Bihar. Uttar Pradesh and trans-Jamuna areas in the
Union Territory of Delhi have left millions of people marooned
and distressed who need to be helped in their hour of need. We
and Nandikar, through our modest means have decided to extend
a show of Football on the 18th September, 1978 and donate the
net proceeds for relief work.

Before concluding, I on behalf of Agragami thank you all for your
generous help and patronage and hope to get the same encouragement when we shall be on the stage, very soon.
