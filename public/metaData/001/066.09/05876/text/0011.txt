A BO U T M Y S E L F

An artiste always desires to express himself through his art work.
he feels he cannot but share with others.

Whatever

This is all the more applicable in

the case of actors.

This feeling, this visualisation does not allow the actor to remain content with
the status quo. Whenever he feels tired of one particular type of acting he
pines for a different one, a new one which may Open new vistas for him. It is
this desire to transcend oneself that can be regarded as a recreation to the
artiste.

1 have appeared in a number of roles, in plays written by playwrights of fame
and also those of lesser fame. । have immensely enjoyed my work in the different
roles in those plays, and this work oi mine has helped me a lot in chiselling
my acting as also in winning some praise and acclaim. But neverthless, a feeling
of discontentment had been haunting me from within. Like the second bird of
the Upanishad my inner self was not satisﬁed with all what I had done so far in
the ﬁeld of art. I felt like going deeper into the realm of art, and after confront-

ing the dark inner truth and reality, derive some newer concepts of the art
of acting.

When i came to learn that in Maharashtra P. L. Deshpande had his way of
expression through one-man shows, I readily acknowledged this as a very
powerful means through which newer concepts of acting could be established.
i decided to embark on a similar experiment where instead of co-acting and

reciprocating with other actors i will have to act with myself.

But before

everything । must have a play —— a play with only one character, and that too

of a woman ! Who is going to write it or me ! Well, Mr Nitish Sen came to my
rescue.

He took it as a challenge to a playwright, and there was Aparajita.
