Dear Rakeshji,
I shall be obliged ifyou clarify :

I.

2.

What is Sarnang? Does he really become mad? If so, on what different
points ?What do you want to express through this character?
What is the signiﬁcance of the Rajhansas and the waves.What emotions

do they represent?
3.

What is your concept of the character of Sundari and Nand.

4.

What is the relation between them? Is Nand afraid of her? Does Sundari
really love him or she loves herself? My concept of Sundari is different
from that of yours. She is from the aristocratic background. She is not
easily angered. She is beautiful not only in physical appearance but also in
speech and control of emotions. I shall like to depict her as a very
attractive and admirable character.

5.

What do you want to convey by the reference of the death of the Mrig?
How does this episode affect Nand?
Why does Nand go to Buddha? Is it due to any deﬁnite thought or is it an

6.

instinctive action.

7.

The last portion of the play is fully of symbols.Your suggestions about it
will help us a lot e.g. why Nand permits his hair to be shaved? Which
emotions are represented by his hair? Why does Bhikshu Anand come
and with what purpose? What does Sundari say in the end?
I do not agree with one or two dialogues of Nand.They do not appear to
be true and I feel that he is speaking a I ie.
But I hasten to add that your thoughts will only will be binding on us.
I hope you will not take it otherwise. I will accept the play and produce it
in the way you have written it. But I do want to know and understand you
so that I can produce it according to your thoughts to the extent
possible.
With best wishes,

You rs truly,

Shyarnan and Jalan
