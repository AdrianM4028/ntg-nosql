Light designer

Sudip Sanyal
As a lighting designer, I have tried to illuminate the space realistically and historically.
The space was enclosed,continuous and also fragmented. l have used a continuous
chain of lights to create a continuous effect and a number of gobos to create a
fragmented effect.

Music Composer
Kuna| Padhy

I Have used Indian instruments and have searched for earthy, isolated sounds.The
music is open in nature and gives a feeling of vastness and also is based on an internal
search of the characters.
