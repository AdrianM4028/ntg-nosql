"GllﬂSllIPﬂM KOlWﬂL"
Ghashiram kotwal is a scathing depiction of the
machinations of power; It is a take of the current beings

that greed produces, and of the perversions of religion
and love that power lust induces. Ghashiram, a penniless Brahrnin form North lndia, voyages to the City of
Pune, in search of his fortune. Hungry, he tries to attend
a feast for Brahrnins but is harshly refused entrance.
Later he is accused of stealing and thrown into prision.
Eventually an embittered Ghashiram is released; humiliated and abused, he shouts "you've made me an
animal; I'll be a devil inside....l'll make pigs of all of you...
I'll make this Pune a Kingdom of pigs."
When his opportunity for vengeance arises,
Ghashiram seizes it, using his lovely young daughter.
Ghashiram sacrifices Lalitagauri to the lecherous old
Nana Phadanavis, Chancellor of Peshva, in return for
the prestigious Kotwali, Office of Chief of Police. Now
Ghashiram as the Kotwal unleashes a reign of terror,

full of ruthless and arbitrary injustice. With the support
of Nana behind him Ghashiram fills the prisions while
all of the Pune trernbles.
Later, the lustful old Nana, tired of Gauri, marries

again for the seventh time. Ghashiram seeks his
dishonoured daughter only to find that she has died
unwed in child birth. Furious, he confronts Nana but is
cowed by the Chancellor's authoritative manner and
quietly agrees to preserve silence. Eventually the bloodthirsty G hashirarn irnprisons Brahrnins for a petty crime
in an overcrowed cell where they die of suffocation. Finally, an enaraged mob demands Ghashiram's death,
