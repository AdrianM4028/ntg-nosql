of the Mahabharata. She was
renowned for her beauty. In order to
find out a suitable match for her, her

father King Drupada arranged for a
Swayambara; While kings and
princes fail, a Brahmin youth
succeeds in the test. He eventually
turns out to be Arjuna. But fate leads
Draupadi to accept all the five
Pandavas as her husbands. Even with
that she tries to be happy. But her
fate would not let her be. She is
insulted and harassed at the royal
court
of
the
Kauravas.
She
accompanies
her
husbands
throughout their long exile. Even
there, Jayadratha tries to steal her
away from the Pandavas. Keechaka
attempts to molest her.
An insulted an enraged Draupadi _
seeks redress of all the wrongs done
to her in a dharmayuddha. And then
follows the battle of Kurukshetra.
But her near ones are slain or
butchered in that battle. She learns
to her bitterment that all wars have
their own crude ways and that no
battle is a dharrnayuddha.
