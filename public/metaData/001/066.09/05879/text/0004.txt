SOME REACTION-Sf} 1111. 1111111
When | came to see you for a minute
backstage after the show, I was so chocked

up emotionally that I

said,

l

can’t say

anything, but I will write to you about my
reaction.
I have not been so completely moved

seeing. any performance-1 for I don’t know
how long ! You are too much Saoli ! ! Your
conception and analysis of Draupadi, sense
of timing,

dancing,

singing,

and finally

acting, has, as the Americans would say
’Zapped’ me totally, and stirred me deeply.
— Pandit Ra Visankar 20. 2. 1989.

Finally l felt that here is a theatrical

experience for which every theatre-lover
should feel proud and grateful to Saoli. l also
feel that Saoli has gone a step further into
the world of theatre which was dominated by
her parents for about 50 years.
—- P. l.. Deshpande lanuary 1990.

... But what the Naathabati Anaathabat is है
Is it a play or monologue ? Or a simple Katha

with musical tryst है Or a post-mortem on
Mahabharat with Draupadi’s life as its central
theme by different kind of reasoning हैं —- It is
a lyrical assortment of all these like a garland
of pearls by which Saoli and her team made
the audience stick to its seat for over two
hours.
— Indian Express, Ahmedabad August ’90
