adaptation of an linglish play. To make the matter worse.
none other
than the so-called script writer is capable of writing fresh
scripts.
Result: The director and the script writer end up teamed with
each

other each time. An Urdu speaking person, the script writer takes a
strong exception to the actors' sordid pronuncration of Urdu words in
the script His complaint to the director in this regard goes unheeded.
The director is of the view, and quite rightly so. that these things do
not matter in the Delhi theatre.
As the dates draw nearer, the director gets involved deeper into the
production part than devoting his time and energy into rehearsal.
How can a theatre group manage to stage a play if the chief does not
run from pillar to post to get police permission and entertainment tax
exemption?
Besides, a couple of actors keep testing the director's patience by
missing the rehearsal, of course for genuine reasons , during the last
few days. Much to the elation of everyone, however, a Sardarj i is
after all caught hold of to play the role of the â€˜tha'. But, who has
dared to challenge the destiny? The very day the play is to be staged
the one playing 'Hakeem' bids farewell to the Pierrot's Troupe for
having got a role in a TV serial. The Urdu speaking script writer is
the unanimous choice for Hakeem's role even if he has never been
into the business of acting. He agrees, but not before making the
director to plead with him for the same. It is in this backdrop, 'Padiye
Agar Beemar' is performed on due dates.
Believe us, we are bringing before you the tragedies that the
rehearsal of any play unfolds. For others, it turns out to be a comedy.
We admit though that our endeavour will be rewarded only if you
laugh at us.
