MAGAR PHlR 13111..

the Hindi play stays clear of casting an AIDS victim as a hapless victim. It only
warns him/her against resorting to escapism since this attitude lends credence to the
society's misconceptions about the disease.
the play goes on exhortiug AIDS victims to stage a comeback to the

wciety and come

forward to dispel the misconceptions about the disease.‘
Sanjay is .\ll)S victim whose fiancee refuses to marry him after coming to know
about the disease he is suli‘ering from. Sanjay's family members also desert him. The
neighbours come to conclude that the whole family carries AIDS virus. Under

distress. San‘iav leaves for Bombay to live a lonely life. without ever committing the
mistake of revealing about his disease to anybody. In Bombay, Sanjay meets Asha,

also an .\I DS victim. Asha is full of life and optimistic to the core. Sanjay does not tell
.\sha about his disease. But, Asha somehow comes to know about the same. She

criticises Sanjay's escapism and holds this very tendency of him equally responsible
for whatever the ill-treatment he as an AIDS victim received from his family members
and others back home. She also turns down Sanjay's proposal to marry her, pointing
out that that reﬂected his desire to lead a social life, which he should fulfill on a larger
plank by letting himself accepted by the whole society and for the larger purpose of
numerous other such yictims' return to the society.

Last but not the least, the play does not reduce itself to a propaganda affair. So, it
maintains the aesthetics of the 'l)rama' too. The rest is left to you to infer by watching
the plat} 1n person.
