playwright, director, theoritician Brecht not through books only but by confronting
him both on stage and offstage. Brecht has been performed almost every alternate
year during the past 25 years. Brecht has been directed by visiting German

directors as well as NS D graduates. His plays have been performed in translation
as well as in adaptations because his plays have such a universal appeal that they

fit into any landscape and geographical region of the world. Aurat Bhali Ram Kali
or Chopra Kamal Naukar Jamal were excellent examples of adaptations which
retained the power of a Brecht original.

Productions at NSD have tried to treat Brecht the playwright in many innovative
ways as is done with other classics and not necessarily being bogged down by his
production theories.
Brecht has been scene in his own mettle at the NSD as well as used as a raw
material for experimentation. Programmes have been produced to project his
poetry, his life and times also. With a new batch of theatre students NSD
‘experiences’ Brecht in totality - the playwright, the theoritician and creater of a
style.
