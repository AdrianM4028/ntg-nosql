today. Even though the realities depicted by Brecht do not conform to those of our
society on a one-to-one basis yet the way events are unfolding one can no longer

ignore the danger looming in the background. We realise that if steps were not
taken in time, the day is not far off when the realities being presented on the stage
may well become part of our own daily lives.
If this adaptation is able to make the audience feel such apprehension even in a
small measure the effort would not have been wasted.
