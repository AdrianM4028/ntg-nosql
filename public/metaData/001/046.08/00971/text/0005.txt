confronted the fact that this was a ‘play’; the stage was set up to show the
mechanics of performance - the lights, the banners, and the notational sets

indicated time and place rather than recreated them. In acting, too the assumption
was, like with space, that the character be shown rather than lived. What Brecht
sought on stage was ‘complex seeing’ - where alternative points of view,

contradictions, goodness and badness exist in the same situation, and even in the
same character, forcing us to rethink our rnoralities and our social assumptions.
