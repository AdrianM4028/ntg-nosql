with the Italian company directed by

Scara-

mouche (FLORILLI) in the Theatre du Peiit-Bourbon.

M.

who was an excellent character in his own comedies, was
unconvincing in tragedy.
Despite this he attempted
several times to build up a repertoire of tragedies, but
added to his weakness. his company could not match the
tragic style of the actors of the HOTEL DE BOURGOGNE
and the Theatre du Marais. Success came only when M.
appeared in his comedies : L’ Etourdi; Le Depit amoureux;
Les Precieuses ridicules: Sganarell on Le Cocu imaginaire,
1660. When M. took over the Theatre du Palais Royal, he
opened again with a serious heroic drama Dom Garcie de
Navarre, ou le Prince jaloux’ the ﬁrst and only failure.
which was wiped out by a series of triumphant successes :
L’ Ecole des maris, 1661; L’ Ecole des temmes, 1663; La
Critique de L’ Ecole des femrnes 1663; L’ Amour medecin
1665 Le Misanthrop, 1666; L’ Avere, malgrelui, 1666;
Amphitryon, 1668; L Avare, 1668; Les Fourberie de Scapin,
1671; Les Femmes Savantes, 1672; and Le Malade imaginaire, 16.3.

M's dramatic works combine criticism of general human
failings (greed, hypocrisy) with attacks on contemporary
faults (sanctimony inteilectual and social pretentiousness)
and support the moderate and reasonable. Although
Tartuffe attacks only a false piety, it aroused strong
protest and was not performed in public until 1669 (written
1664 and several times performed in private before the
Court). Don Juan, ou Le Festin de Pierre, 1665, interpreted as a profession of atheism, had to be removed from
the stage and was not published during M.s lifetime.
He was protected by Louis XIV personally from attacks on
his private lite, among them the accusation that his wife
ARMANDE BEJARI (whom he married 1662), a sister or
daughter of Madeleine B. was his own daughter. From
1661 he also wrote several plays LlBRETTl, comedies
BALLETS DE COUR, and FARCES specially for festivities
and entertainments at Court: Les Facheux, 1661 ; L’ lmpromptu de Versailles, 1663; Le Mariage force, 1664 ; La
Princess d’Elide, 1c64; George Dondin ou le Mari confondu,
1668; Monsieur de Pourceaugnac, 1669; Les Amants
magniﬂques, 1670; Le Bourgeois gentilhomme, 1670; Psyche,

1671; La Comtesse d’ Escarbagnas, 1671.
