Rang Vidushak began as an evening group in 1984, attracting people
from all walks to participate in its new approach and experimentation.

surroundings had its effects on the group. Things were becoming
different. The changes within the political scenario were rapid. Stability
was required all over. The old found its place in the background. in these

Vidushak was chosen to do this.

Therefore, what began as a little group of enthusiasts, dedicating their
evening hours to creativity, became an independent theatre group in
