मंगल करनि कलि-मल हरनि

तुलसी कथा रघुनाथ की.
Says Tulsi
In this age of Kali
the story of Rama showers bounty
and destroys evil.

The story of Rama has fascinated people, in
India and abroad, through the ages.’ It has inspired

poets and artists to present the epic theme in
poetry and dance, in painting and sculpture. As
Kapila Vatsyayan says : ’it has held the imagination
of all classes of people, ranging from the sophisticated and affluent to the most humble and lowly.
It has permeated all aspects living, religious,
cannonical and artistic.’
Rama-charit-manas of Tulsidas has a honoured

place in the Ramayana

literature.

Kathak is a

classical dance from of the region where the Rama

story had its origin.
In Katha Raghunath Ki—the title has been
taken from a line of Tulsidas—the Kathak Kendra

has attempted to present the story, as challenging
as it is vibrant, in the Kathak dance form.
The libretto has been devised by Dr. Shrimati
lnduja Awasthi.
