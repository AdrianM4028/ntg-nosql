OF KASHMIR it is said,

“if Heaven on the earth be,
it is here, it is here, it is here"

In this heaven on earth. in the picturesque little village of
Chandahar was born a child as pretty and delicate as the saffron flowers
that blossomed in the village lined with leafed Chinars and slender

poplars. She was rightly named Zoon—the moon.
