DIRECTOR’S NOTE
“ALI BABA AND BAABLU THE BEER” is basd on the Arabian
Nights Classic “Alibaba & the 40 thieves". This adaption takes
you through the crazy escapades of Alibaba and his faithful pet

Baablu the Bear. Baablu an all new character was created so that
he could interact and relate with children on a one-to-one basis.
When Mrs. Chona invited me, I was a little hesitant. A Bi-Lingual

play using mime, dance, live singing and Taekwondo was
centainly a daunting proposition!
However, when I arrived in Delhi, l was overwhelmed by the

wealth of creative talent the children had and I realised how

unfounded my fears were. It was very difficult to cat the play, as
there were so many talented children, we had to introduce new
characters.

It has been a real pleasure working with Mrs. Uma Raman and
her team of extremely efficient and talented teachers and
children.
On to Ali Baba and Baablu the Bear..... ..

lt’s imaginative. It’s fun. It’s funny.
It’s Bi-Lingual. It’s a Musical. It’s New. It’s a Classicll
