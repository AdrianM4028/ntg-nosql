“ALIBABA AND BAABLU THE BEAR”
A SYNOPSIS

“ALIBABA AND BAABLU THE BEAR” is a revival of those
treasured moments of fantasy, we rarely find time to indulge in.
The story, while retaining most of its classical flavour, centres
around the escapades of Ali Baba, a poor woodcutter, and his
faithful companion, Baablu the Bear. On one of their usual rounds
in the forest, Baablu accidentally stumbles upon a dacoit’s lair,
brimming with stolen jewels. This gang of daku’s is headed by a
supposedely frightful (but in truth a weakling) Chief-Faltu
Chorkumar. The second half of the play deals with outrageously
hysterical situatiohns, and the frantic attempts of Faltu (now
disguised as a hermit) to regain his lost wealth, which is being

utilised by Ali Baba to help the needy. These attempts of Faltu are

engineerd by Bade Chacha, Ali Baba’s greedy elder brother. What

k

follows is a stream of rib-tickling events, guaranteed to keep the
laughter ringing all through the show.
