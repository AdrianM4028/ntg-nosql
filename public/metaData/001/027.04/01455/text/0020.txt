houses were looking

like Matchboxes and trees like dots. There
was a place where there were stones. Then
as we went higher a place came where
there was grass and we saw colourful
flowers. It was a fairy land, We met the
fairies. They wore beautiful dresses and
were looking very colourful
They told us
not to go up because it was dangerous to
go ahead. But we went further higher.
Then we saw a huge devil. He attacked
our spaceship with bows and arrows. He
was about to throw a bomb on us, When
we pressed the button and came back to
the earth.
