GREEDY ALWAYS SUFFERS
Once upon a time there were two friends Kashi and Biru. Kashi was very gentle and
kindhearted, but Biru was not friendly with him as he pretended to be. Biru always
wanted to punish Kashi, but he could not. One day when Kashi went to the
forest he saw a tiger.

Luckily he saw him and climbed a tree and cried 'Oh God of the

forest please save me".

The God of the forest heard

his cry and said

'Kashi' oh

Kashi my dear son take this axe and ask it to save you from all the troubles'
and with these words the God gave him a magic-golden axe. Kashi told Biru
what had happened. As we know that Biru was very greedy. He also dld the same
when he saw a tiger next day. The God gave him an ordinary-golden axe but Biru didn't
know it. He asked the axe to save him but being an ordinary axe it could not save
him. The tiger didn't disappear, it came very near to Biru and you know what happened
afterwards.
Moral :‘Don't be greedy.
