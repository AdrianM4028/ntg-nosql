THOUGHTS
Children are like little birdies. They eat, play, learn and grow in secure and loving
homes. They should not be deprived of this pleasure. Such an enioyable and
free time never comes back in their lives.

Teachers and parents are like Gods to the children. They like to imitate and follow
them. Let us make some sacriIice so that they can grow happy, healthy, honest
and good citizens oI India.
AS THE TWIG IS BENT, SO THE TREE GROWS.
THE FUTURE IS BUILT ON THE FOUNDATION OF THE PRESENT.

Children need loving care and guidance. We, adults are responsible for their
all-round development, physical as well as mental.

Children are like plants. Besides nutrition they need to breathe in freedom but
it is the duty at parents and teachers to see that they donâ€™t grow wild.

Children thrive on praise. It is more important to praise a child tor
work and his good behaviour. Always highlights the positive.
