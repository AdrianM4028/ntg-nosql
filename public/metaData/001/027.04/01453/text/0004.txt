MESSAGE
I am glad to learn that the Junior School at DPS, Mathura Road is putting
up a musical fantasy ALICE IN WONERLAND, 'in which nearly 100
childern will participate. "Alice in Wonderland" has caught the imagination ot the young ever since its author produced the book to amuse
a young child he was interested in. He did not realize at that time that
he was creating something wonderful that will catch the imagination of
the young all over the world. I expect the musical fantasy, to be put by
the children of the Junior School, to be not only interesting but Full of
joy and happiness. I wish the musical fantasy every success.
