ecause
you never
ride
alone
No man is an island. No one lives all by oneself. Alone.

In isolation.

For every time you go out, into the world, you carry
with you moments of the lives of so many 'who make
you what you are.

Who make your today. Andyour tOInorrow.
Caring parents. Doting wife.. Loving children. Trusting
friends.

Indeed, at Apollo Tyres, we understand;
We care.

And it shows. In every carefully designed; ‘sipe pattern.
In every mm of rubber that goes into specially evolved
designs. In every mind-bending h0ur7'spent in Studying
road and climatic. conditions.

Pride and concern. That stay withyou, all the way. ५
To make sure that you never ride alone When you are
on Apollo tyres.
