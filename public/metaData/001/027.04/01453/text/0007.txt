MESSAGE
It gives me great pleasure to convey my greetings to the staff and children
of Delhi Public School, Mathura Road (Junior School) who have worked

long hours to put up a musical Fantasy ’ALICE IN WONDERLAND’. It
is the hard work, enthusiasm and dedication of the students and staff

which has changed fantasy into a reality. I appreciate their effort and
take this opportunity to congratulate for organising this event.

For the ’ALICE’ and others in BPS. we have no ’tantasy’ but daily we
endeavour to provide a wonderland where new horizons are reached
and the little ones who join us are prepared to step out into thexworld,
highly educated, well groomed and responsible youths who can face the
challenges of lite.
