When you hunt for Analysts,
be where their eyes fall:

On ३ Capital Market pages
When you recruit analysts for your research department,

will you recruit scrnecne who has not read Capital Market?
Who doesn’t know what P/E ratios are, what Industry Composites
are, what Scoreboards are? And what options are,

what paperless trading is and what Issue Ratings stand for?

And when you need someone who reads all the pages of Capital
market regularly, do you have to go elsewhere to find him?

The best of the Analysts shape up through Capital Mark
et Pages.
