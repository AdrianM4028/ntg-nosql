Alice in Wonderland
Tribute to a child’s imagination. An imagination which has been
suppressed for generations or dismissed as whimsical. Lewis Carroll

was probably one of those kids who was never taken seriously and
was suppressed into the ’kids are supposed to be goody - goody’
image.’ But these thoughts and dreams could not stay inside and the
dreams, night mares and fantasies all came pouring out via the
author’s pen; a sort of revenge on the adult world.

This version of Alice in Wonderland concentrates on 4 scenes mainly
because scenes showing Alice growing big and shrinking had to be
lelt out and we have tried to make it as compact as possible.
The tour scenes being used are:

Scene I

:

Tweedlee and Tweedledurn

Scene II

:

Mad Tea Party

Scene I" :

Advice from a Caterpillar
Interval

Scene IV :

The Queen’s Garden

I’m sure all of you were good boys and girls and read your
’Alice in Wonderland’ when you were young, so there is no Further
need to elaborate.
