I am very happy to note that the Junior Section of the D.P.S., Mathura
Road is putting up "Alice in Wonder Land". A lot of team effort is
required to make such a play a success and I am sure that the students
will put in their heart and soul and will come out with Flying colours.
I wish them all the success in their venture
