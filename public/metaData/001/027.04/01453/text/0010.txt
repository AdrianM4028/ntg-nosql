I am very happy to note that the Junior Section at the DPS, Mathura
Road is putting up "Alice in Wonder Land". A lot at team ellort is
required to make such a play a success and I am sure that the students
will put in their heart and soul and will come out with flying colours.
I wish them all the success in their venture
