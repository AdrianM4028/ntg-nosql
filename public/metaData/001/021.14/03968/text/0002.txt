Baghdad Burning is a play based on the
Internet blog of the same name, posted on the web, 2003
onwards by an Iraqi woman, who prefers to remain anonymous
calling herself River bend. As the name itself suggests, the
entries talk about the US occupation of Iraq and a permanent

callous destruction of a whole country, the life style of its
people and the secular and modern fabric of its society.
However what makes this blog unique is the completely
unsentimental view and the sharp and witty critique of its
author, on the impact of this completely unjust war on the
common people and their daily life. It also lays bare the farce
of democracy that the US plays out on this country through its
puppet government.

The play tries to capture some moments of the daily life of the
people of Iraq as they struggle to keep their sanity in a world
crumbling around them, along with highlighting some harsh
political and economic realities that the country is encountering
as the law and order in the country has completely broken
down.
