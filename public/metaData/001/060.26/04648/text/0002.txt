P l. AYW R lG H T’ वि-;-, NOTE
This play is a tribute to the century old classic
'Shahiahan' and its creator, Sh. Diiendralal Roy.
Zawal-e-Azim can be called as a documentation

of the inevitable downfall of the Colossal Mughal
Empire established by Ba bur. The play is set in the
middle of the year i 658. Along with the declining
medical condition, the Great Mughal Emperor
Shahiahan faces an unprecedented situation, not
only in the form of external aggressions, but also
as serious tremors within the internal
administrative infrastructure. The prestigious
Peacock Throne is being notoriously disputed
over by its heirs,~-the four sons of the ailing,“
Emperor. The helpless heart of the Emperor is
ripped apart between the secularism of Dara
and the fundamentalism of Aurangzeb; between
love and violence; trust and envy.
Zawal-e-Azim is not lust a theatrical testimony of
mistrust, conspiracies, betrayal and violence; it
rather extends to present the empathetic analysis
of how the natural emotions and simple values of
a vulnerable worldly being are crushed down
under the debris of self-contradicting conflicts
and ambitious desires of power. The play ends
with a note of a soul shattering agony.

Although the play revolves bround Shahlahan, he
has not been depicted as the deprived, pain
smitten tragic hero. He was still the central system
of his administration and political machinery,
even after the war of succession swept scars on his
heart. But where is then the tragedy of the play?
