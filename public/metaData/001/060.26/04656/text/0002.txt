SYN O PS l S
The present play illustrates the post-modern crisis of identity.

The state of identity of a man is in a continuous flux. The play,

Return of Godot 2012, is a satire on Samuel Beckett‘s ’Waiting
for Godot’ that declares that Godot never comes. In this play,

Godot arrives as the metaphor of the degenerated postmodern multinationals under the garb of globalization and
liberalization. With extreme discontinuity produced by our
political and social experiences, the play reveals the utter

confusion that we are living upon. As the two protagonists

hunt for answers as to why their generation is solemnly
inching towards a nameless catastrophe, they fall into a

whirlpool of absurdity. The play projects the precarious
position of the Middle class in this rapidly changing global

scenario. Values fade out, apathy seeps in. All that is

considered as pure and true now seems to be a downloadable
virtual reality. Nothing feels real anymore. But hope still
pervades through rise of individual consciousness that is the
liarbiﬁger of collective action.
