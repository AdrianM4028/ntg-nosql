Hawalat
The play ‘Hawalat' revolves around the story of three Youth who have no
place to live. It was the coldest night of winter and they were without food
and shelter. Since nobody was ready to offer them shelter, they decided to
have the same in a police lock—up. Consequently they approached a police cop
as criminals. The cop is not ready to believe them and asks them to establish

their credentials by demonstrating their expertise and past criminal record. To
avoid them, the cop agrees to take them to the lock—up (Hawalat), after tying
their eyes. Instead of taking them to the Police station, he takes them around
in circles and finally leave them at the place from where they had started. The
play is a satire on the exploitation of youth by the present system. The

politicians of this country have been befooling the youth since independence
in the same way the cop played with them.
