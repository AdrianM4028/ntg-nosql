Girgit
The story of the play revolves around a corrupt police ofﬁcer, who changes
colours like a chameleon, every time the situation changes irrespective of what
is right or wrong. The action starts when a dog bites a pickpocket who
approaches the officer to help him to black mail the owner of the dog with
the objective of obtaining a hefty compensation. The cop begins to search for
the owner but in vain. A passerby hints that the dog may belong to the local
minister as he saw a similar dog at his place. On getting this clue, the officer
starts beating the pickpocket for teasing the dog. The ofﬁcer claims that the
dog of a minister cannot bite unless and until provoked to do so. While he is
beating the pickpocket, another man from the crowd advises that the local
minister cannot own this dog, as he is known to have pointer—hunting dogs.
Now the dog is thrashed and the search continues for the owner of the dog to
enable the pickpocket to get his claim. The beating of the dog continues until
a servant of the minister appears on the scene. At ﬁrst he refuses to recognize
the dog but later identiﬁes him as the dog of minister’s brother who is visiting
from Delhi. And the whole situation changes once again.
