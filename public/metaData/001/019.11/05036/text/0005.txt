Suno Eh Kahani
“GUDDI” central character of this play is representative of a major section
of rural lower middle class adolescent young girls, who are forced into
matrimony at a very tender age. Guddi is fully aware of the strains of early
marriage, as it has taken its toll in untimely death of her mother. She wants to
grow and get educated before she takes up the responsibility of married life.
Her dreams are shattered, a ‘suitable’ groom is found and marriage date is
fixed. While the marriage ceremonies are being performed, help comes in the
form of intervention by legal authorities and decision of marriage is deferred
for appropriate time. The play highlights the plight of young girls who are
sacrificed at the altar of rotten, redundant customs of illiterate and ignorant
sections of our society.
