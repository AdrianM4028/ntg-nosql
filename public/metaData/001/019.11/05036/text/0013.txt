Fandi
“Fandi” portrays the desperate feelings of a son who has to ‘mercy kill’ his
father. Unable to bear the torture, which his father is facing, who is suffering
from cancer, Fandi is forced to end his father’s life. Poverty stricken Fandi
could no longer provide required medical aid and having exhausted all his
resources, he has no other option, than to yield to his father’s pleadings to give
him a respectable death. Now begins the actual conflict when Fandi has to
encounter the charges of having murdered his father. Advocate Bhagat Ram is
nominated by the Government to plead Fandi's case. The trial for the case
unfolds a situation in which the tarnished action of the son appears to be a
compulsive act to bring an end to the misery of a cancer patient writhing in
pain. While the charges of fratricide are being framed against Fandi, his
advocate assures him that the judgement will go in his favour if the judges go
into the depth of the case and understand the circumstances, which led to the

killing. The playwright brings forth the inner turmoil, which Fandi faces after
the killing and the mental agony having faced the court, Dr. Shanker Shesh
stirs the emotions of the audience and leaves it to them to give their ﬁnal
verdict.
