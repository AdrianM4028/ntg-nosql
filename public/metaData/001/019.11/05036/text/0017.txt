The play revolves around a triangular love story. The playwright unfolds the
sensitive relationship of an extramarital affair, after the death of a young lady
whose husband and the lover meet for the first time. Their encounter reveals
the minute intricacies of a man— woman relationship and the frustrations of a
secret love affair. The dramatic action becomes even more interesting when it
is shown that the husband comes to know about the illicit relationship after
the death of his wife. The playwright has exposed the inner conflicts through
a highly experimental and intellectual thematic design.
