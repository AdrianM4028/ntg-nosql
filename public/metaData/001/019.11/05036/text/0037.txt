With the support ofThe Ford Foundation, Natrang
started a theatre laboratory project in the year I992.
The emphasis of. the project work was to strengthen
our experimental work and repertoire of~ Natrang.
Ever since the inception of Natrang our quest

continued for the establishment of a theatre that
could speak across limguage barriers. In this process
many plays and exercise productions were produced
in search of. a new theatre language by transforming
the text into visual images. Largely inspired by the
regional performing modes a theatre is being evolved
which is rooted in our soil but at the same time
highly experiemental and innovative in terms of its
visual poetic sensibility and expressive universality. ln

our theatre lalmratory the thrust for original work is
always there to create a theatre that is highly theatrical
visually and has more impact dramatically. The visible
growth could be seen in our recent productions
'Ghtunayee’ and ‘Hum Hain Na', both of which
proved to be the shining examples of innovative
experiements of visual poetry done in the
QICCOITIPll-SthUH ()l 0111‘ CI'CL‘ithC‘ 111138101].
