Gan:
‘Gatt’ shows that one and all tend to shirk their own responsibilities and work
and pass it on to others. Instead they indulge in high sloganism, claiming to
be the redeemers of the suffering masses. This is symbolized by a person
falling into a ditch whose pleas to help him come out unanswered by one and
all. Different people pass by him like planners, young men, religious leaders,
political leaders, cops and a foreigner. The person in distress is given different
excuses for their inability in rendering help to him. The unemployed youth has
no time. The ‘Sadhu’ assures him that they will pray for ‘vishaw shanti’ and
give him their blessings. The cop lodges a FIR but no one renders a helping
hand to the man in the ‘Gatt’. It is amusing when a political leader gives long
sermons above the ‘Gatt’ covered by wooden planks. However the man has no
listeners. The irony is that even a foreigner doing research on India after

Independence asks the fallen man what he feels about the progress in the
country and which country he wants to support. The man is desperate to be
rescued and is not concerned with the politics of the neighbouring country.
While every one is busy in self— glorification, the pleas of the man in the
‘Gatt’ fall on deaf ears. The play reflects the plight of the ignored masses, who
continue to suffer for want of help from those at the helm of affairs or for
that matter anybody in the society.
