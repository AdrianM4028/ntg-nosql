Neend Kyon Raat Bhar
Nahein Aati
Engulfed by the darkness of the night, a lonely lady unable to enjoy a peaceful

sleep finds a way to beat her melancholy by picking up the receiver and
initiating telephonic conversations with anyone without caring to find out the
dialled number. Each time the person at the other end mistakes her to be
someone else. To a young man she could be the other woman in his life. For a
dejected girl it could be her lover ringing up at that hour of the night.
Learning that she is frustrated, the lonely lady’s suggestion to the young lady

is, “give your lover a chance and enjoy the joys of life as they come”. She
however does. not reveal her own painful feelings. While talking to a small
child, who is left home alone, she shares the emotive feelings of her separation

from her husband and death of her only child. This is in response to the
simple questions put up by the lonely child. To the amusement of the small
child, the lady correctly answers all the puzzles put up by the little one.
However, the child is unable to answer one puzzle, which disturbs the lady.
The lady expecting to find some respite to her sorrows through conversation
is disappointed and as she peeps into people’s lives she becomes ever more
miserable. Unable to bear the deep depression, she ends her life. Her death
invokes no more than a gossip with little understanding of the disturbed state
of a young forlorn lady, which the writer wants to convey.
