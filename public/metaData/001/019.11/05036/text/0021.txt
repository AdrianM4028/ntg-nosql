Panj a,
Panja is the Hindi translation of the famous play ‘The Monkey’s Paw’. The

story highlights the unsatiated desire of a greedy family, who come into
possession of ‘the panja’, which has supernatural powers for granting them
three wishes. In their greed they ignore the fact, that the repercussions of its

use would bring disaster in the long run.
The Mehra family lived happily. However on acquiring the ‘Panja’ they
become greedy, ignoring the warnings of using it. The fulfillment of Mr.
Mehra's wish proves disastrous and heart rending. There is an element of

tragic irony in the play the supernatural powers of the ‘Panja’ destroys the
peace and joy of those who possess it. The old parents life becomes miserable
when their wish is granted, which comes in the form of monetary
compensation for the death of their only son. Totally shattered they use the

panja for granting the second wish to see their son alive again. They are
terrified by the loud knocks on the door, when they discover that the dead son
has returned, horribly mutilated. In desperation the father uses the 'Panja' to
grant his third wish so that his son can be dead again and rest in peace. The

play ends on a tragic note evoking sympathies for the greedy couple whose
dreams have been shattered by the supernatural ‘panja’.
