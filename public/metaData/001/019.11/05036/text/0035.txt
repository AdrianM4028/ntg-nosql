The long cherished dream of Natrang
Repertory group was realized with the beginning

of our weekly programme ‘Sunday Theatre’ from
28th November, 2004. The Silver jubilee of. this
regular theatre series of Natrang was celebrated
with big fun-fare on 15th May, 2005 at jam—
packed Abhinav Theatre, Jammu with the staging
of highly acclaimed play ‘Bawa Jitto’. Natrang
has the credit of being the first theatre group of

North India, which is running a weekly theatre
programme. This regular event has changed the

whole theatre scene of Jammu and Natrang has
become an important destination even for the

visitors coming from outside. The continued
sustenance of. ‘Sunday Theatre’ is perhaps the

biggest ever challenge being faced by Natrang
actors and its management. Despite burning
midnight oil things become even more difﬁcult

when the main group is to move outside Iammu
for performances. Between 19th to 26th
December, 2004 the group was away to Kolkata

for participation in Nandikar’s National theat
festival but the ‘SundayTheatre’ continued with

the performances of ‘Neend Kyon Raat Bhar

Nahein Aati’, ‘Marnoprant’ and ‘Refund'.
