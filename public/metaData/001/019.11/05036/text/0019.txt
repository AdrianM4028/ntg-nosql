Damad
The play projects the enthusiasm with which some people give refuge to
freedom fighters, even at the cost of sacriﬁcing their loved ones. The story
revolves around a ‘Bhagi’ freedom ﬁghter Himmat Singh who knocks the door
of a family who are awaiting the arrival of their son—in—law. Filled with
excitement, the daughter opens the door, only to find the ‘Bhagi’. The old lady
refuses to give him shelter. However the Bhagi cleverly works her sentiments
and persuades her and pleads that to keep the flame of freedom burning, she
has to give refuge to him. He even reminds her that her own husband had
sacrificed his life for the sake of freedom. The lady is so moved that she not
only gives shelter to the ‘Bhagi’ (revolutionary) but makes him sit next to her
daughter to pose as her husband to avoid the police from arresting him when
they come in search of him. The cops believing the ‘Bhagi’ to be the real son—
in—law go away but keep a watch on the house. The ‘Bhagi’ escapes after the
police leave. Later, the real son-in—law comes to the house and the story takes
a new turn when the police again raid the house and think he is the ‘Bhagi’.
The pleadings of the old lady that this is her real ‘Damad’ fall on deaf ears.
The tragic situation of the helpless lady is pathetic; who not only lost her
husband but also sacrificed her ‘Damad’ for the cause of freedom.
