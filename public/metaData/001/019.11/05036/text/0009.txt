Andhon ka Hathi
Our beloved leaders have varying solutions to all problems. Everyone has
different ideas and stick to their ideologies based on their religious and

political leanings. The play ‘Andhon Ka Hathi’ portrays, how they manipulate
the real issues.

The play is based on a famous tale of wisdom ‘The Five Blind Men And the

Elephant’, and is a hard—hitting satire on politicians. Their approach in handling
the affairs of the country, as of today has been beautifully portrayed. The story

revolves around five blind—rnen and an elephant. Sutradhar—the presenter of
the play brings an elephant before five blinds and requests them to identify,
recognize, give their own interpretations and find out the possible threats

from him. In the process blind-men catch hold of different parts of the
elephants body. They touch the trunk, ear, leg, tail and the stomach of the
elephant. With their interpretations start a fight between them over their
difference of opinion about the elephant. The conflict symbolizes the fight

between different political ideologies and religious beliefs. The blind represent
the establishment and its handling of important National issues. In a highly
intellectual manner the whole theatrical performance draws the true picture of
our country. When the narrator of the play tries to expose the blind men, they
kill him. The system does not want to be questioned, anybody who dares to
do so will meet the narrator’s fate.
