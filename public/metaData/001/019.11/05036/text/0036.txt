Since 1987, Natrang has been performing
theatre for the rural masses. Social themes
rooted in the local culture have been devised
exclusively for open-air performances. This is a
theatre against social evils, communalism,

corruption, nepotism and terrorism. One can
witness the magical power of theatre while

Natrang performs in rural areas. Over fifteen
plays have been produced by Natrang and have

been stang in almost all the districts of ’I&K.
The popular plays staged under this programme
include ‘Anpadein Da Hall’. ‘ls Gran (ii Burg
Banai Lo’, ‘Suno Eh Kahani’, ‘Aaj Ki Aurat',
‘Aag’, ‘Gatt', ‘Mate Tabre Da Hall', ‘Shesh Nag
Da Bhar’, ' Mere Bhi Hain Kish Khaab' and

'Jalokhala’. The most satisfying experience of
this initiative was that we took theatre to such
inaccessible areas that are beyond the reach of

transport and electronic media. At places the
number of audience for Natrang would go
beyond the thousand people. Disturbances in
some areas of the State have reduced our tours

and the audience but our mission of taking
theatre to the masses with a cause still continues.
Nine shows were organised in February this year

in the lndo—Pak border villages of ‘Iammu and
Ka t h L1 a districts.
