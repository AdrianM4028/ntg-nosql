Giddh : A Study in Petit

Bourgeois “Angst”
“Even I do not know who I am”——Rajaninath.
(Giddh : Part 1, Scene 4)

This statement, seemingly too banal to reﬂect the sense of
tragic, inexorable doom and violence lhlt permeates the play,
really sums up the basic dilemma of the characters. Rajaninath,

the poet, is in many ways the most sensitive and self-conscious
of the ‘vultures’.

The seeking after happiness is a basic human drive. If one
accepts this premise, one can understand the existential anxiety—
material, moral and social—of the Pitales and, by extension,

that of the typical Indian petit bourgeois. The latter is caught in
the same vortex of almost cannibalistic anxiety, the manifesta-

tions of which may vary from case to case.
