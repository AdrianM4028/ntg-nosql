That is why, in the last analysis, any production of the
play, if insightful, must inspire a true understanding of the PFC‘
dicament of the “vultures” instead of mere hatred for them. By
understanding one does not mean sympathy, as commonly under-

stood, even for “good” characters like Rajaninath or Rama.
For, they typify two important tendencies of the same petit
bourgeoisie mentality—the philosophy of angry inaction and
the philosophy of resigned, though sullen, submissiveness, respectively.

In other words, what one must seek to present to the
audience is not so much a family of savages as an analysis of
their savagery, and the reasons for their behaviour, leading ulti—

mately, and by implication, to an analysis of the values of a
society that pushes them towards such a behaviour. A diSpassionate understanding and portrayal even, (and perhaps eSPECi'

ally)

of such sordid behaviour of men and women as is

portrayed in the play, will lead us closer to the truth than falsely

generated hatred or sympathy. It is also more human and
honest. It will lead us to question our ownselves.
