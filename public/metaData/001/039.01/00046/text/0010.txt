the task of the. Poet
—H E N R I K I BS E N

I have been inSpired by what appears on
introspection as the dregs and sediment
of one's own

nature.

Writing has been

to me like a bath frc m which I have risen
feeling cleaner, healthier, and freer'
Yes, gentlemen, nobody can picture
poetically. anything for which he himself '
has not to a certain degree and at least
at times served as a model. And who is
the man among us who has not now and
then left and recognized within himself
a contradiction between word and deed,
between will and duty, between life and
theory in general? Or who is there among
us Who has not, at least at times, been
egoistically sufﬂczent unto himself, and
half unconsciously, half in good faith,
sought to extenuate his conduct both to
others and to himself?
I believe that in saying all this to you, to
the students, my remarks have found
exactly the right audience. You will understand them as they are meant to be

understood. Fora student has essentially the same task as the poet: to make
clear to himself, and thereby to others,
the temporal
and eternal questions
which are astir in the age and in the
community to which he belongs.
