I hope that your production of Heda Gabler
will be successful but I also hope that if you put
on another foreign play that it will one that has

not yet been performed in India.

There are so

many to choose from. I am inclined to judge
foreign play in India by their power to stimulate
original play writing which it appars they seldom

if ever do. Ht the end of the nineteenth century
and the beginning of the twentieth,
Ibsen
greatly influenced British playwrights by his
dramatic approach to contemporary life. Contemporary India teems with subject to dramatize
by which she could be conveyed to the rest of the

world, if need be. Qs yet the time has not come
for international touring companies, playing themselve, but when that time does come what plays

would an India company contribute? Contemporary ones, of course, but also there should be
plays historical and mythological in a contemporaneous manner. Why not put on some Iriah plays
as a change from Ibsen ? The Irish scene and
Irish temperament are I think more closely allied

to Indian temperament and 'scene‘ than the
Norwegian and therefore more likely to stimulate
original Indian plays.
