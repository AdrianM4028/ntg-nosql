Director’s Note

JAHANGIR is not a historical extravaganza, although the manner of
writing and technique of presentation are more or less in the Indian and

Shakespearean tradition.
JAHANGIR is an attempt to re-appraise the fourth Great Moghul of
India. Bamber Gascoigne writes “Historians of a schoolmasterly
disposition have tended to award Jahangir very low marks as being
debauched, spineless, and susceptible to women, but he is among the most

sympathetic of the Great Moghuls and was at least in cultural matters
one of the most talented”. Gascoigne’s masterly assessment helps me to
clarify some of my own ideas on the monarch, though I had read
Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri and already written the major portion of my play.
What fascinated me about this 17th century Moghul was his “modernity”.
Akbar was the Great Benevolent Despot the doer, achiever. the Man of
Action. Jahangir shareswith the modern man scepticism. indecisiveness
and inaction, the inability “To Be”. Like Donne he contemplated images
of Death, Like Hamlet he found Life too much of an enigma to be
se lflassu red .

It is this aspect of Jahangir’s character that I’ve tried to portray though
a legendary story. Whether Anarkali was real or not is immaterial.
She is just the Impossible Dream of a Visionary. In this sense my fantasy
of the famous Romance is just a means to an end
The Cast and Production Team hope you will give us your best wishes
in this very difﬁcult task.
