CALCUTTA PLAYERS

We often hear that the English Speaking Group Theatre has become a
preoccupation for the sons of the aﬂluent in Calcutta. Most of the actors
and organisers of English plays have a missionary education and a cultural
background which looks West for its values.

Calcutta Players consider this the major drawback of the English Speaking
theatre world. What the educated Upper Class of this city need is to be
critically aware of our own way of life, our problems, prejudices, deceptions

in short, the general smugness which is the bane of the well to do.
It is with the intention of ‘holding up the mirror’ to the English speaking
educated class, that Calcutta Players was launched. The British have left
us with the legacy of a language which is indispensable. But language is
social behaviour and if it is irrelevant to our way of life, it becomes
meaningless for us. Let us enrich what we have inherited by relating it
to our experience. Both individual and national, thus help to give greater
scope to self-expression.
Indo-Anglian Plays have not come into their own yet. But it is our belief
it has to and will in the future. With thus aim in View Calcutta Players

staged its last production “A House Divided”. The play dealt with the
problem of Communal Harmony. It had a mixed reception.
