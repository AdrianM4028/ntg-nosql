Perhapl, the best of the ancient Indian dramas, Kalidasa’s
Shakuiitala attracted the creative genius

of generations of

performers through the ages, and time has only enriched its
pop u l a l i ty .
‘—

Observing life as we know it, we View Shakuntala in the light
of the distinctive life and culture of Manipur,

giving it

almost a local colour.

The lyrical feminine movements as

well as the Vigorous

masculine dances of Manipur fall naturally in place in this

story.

Most of the tunes are taken from identical Manipuri

situations like wedding, or a child learning to dance.

The

costumes too follow the same trend.

Always a challenging job to interpret such a well-known
classic,

we humbly dedicate our efforts to

the

rasikas,

without any pretensions.
