About Triveni
From a humble beginning in 1951 with two students in two
small back rooms above a coffee house in Connaught Circus
and one hundred rupee donotion, Triveni today is a sprawling
art complex on Tansen Marg, New Delhi.
It houses three departments of Dance, Music and Painting, which
provide training in these arts to young aspirants as well as
professionals. In the same complex, there are three exhibition
galleries —- an open-air theatre, one small air-conditioned
chamber theatre, a sound proof recording studio, a book-shop,
library, tea terrace, photography section

with dark rooms and

other modern facilities as well as a separate section for child art.
Triveni's Art Department headed by Rameshwar Broota is rated
as one of the finest and has produced students who have won
National Awards and exhibited in major Exhibitions in India
and abroad. In addition to all this, it also has a beautiful
residential complex for staff and artists. Triveni also conducts
periodic short courses like “Introduction to Indian Culture” and
lkebana flower arrangement.
'
Triveni started its Manipuri Dance Ballet Unit in 1965 and has
since then presented nearly twenty ballets. This group headed
by Singhajit has travelled almost all over the world.
Self supporting and independent (except for a small grant for
Manipuri unit from Ministry of Education and Culture) Triveni
also offers scholarships to deserving students.
Recognising the importance of cinema in culture, Triveni has
just launched a 'Film Circle’ in collaboration with the National ‘
Film Archive of India. We plan to eventually compliment the

screenings with lectures and discussions on film history and
appreciation as well as library of film books and journals.
Our sights are set high, our aspirations constantly growing.
