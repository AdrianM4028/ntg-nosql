Narrating the tale of Sita with a small caste of fifteen within
a span of one and half hour is indeed an adventure - so is
creative art.

Ways and means had to

be found

to

overcome

obvious

difficulties in trying to write an epic on the limited surface of
a tiny paper.
But for the problems encountered we wouldnâ€™t have perhaps
known of various artistic possibilities that came our way in
trying to reach the audience like the proverbial dwarf reaching
out for the moon.
With our heads at the feet of Janaki, we ask for forgiveness

for the unavoidable liberties taken and beg of the rasikas to
share of humble efforts with a spirit of devotion and love.
