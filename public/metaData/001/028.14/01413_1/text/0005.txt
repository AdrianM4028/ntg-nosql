About I riveni
From a humble beginning in 1951 with two students in two small
back rooms above a coffee house in Connaught Circus and a

hundred rupee donation, Triveni today is a sprawling complex in
'I‘ansen Marg, New Delhi. Its two buildings house three exhibition
galleries, one open-air theatre, one small air-conditioned chamber
theatre, a recording studio, a bookshop, a cafeteria, library, a resi-

dential complex for the heads of various Departments of Triveni
and, in addition, Departments for teaching Dance, Music, Painting

and Sculpture, Pottery and Ceramics, Photography — for which
there is a fully equipped dark room and all modern facilities plus a separate section of art for children. Triveni has an average

of three hundred students on its rolls.
We also hold courses in Ikebana Flower Arrangement and a series

of lectures by eminent experts on

“Introduction

to

Indian

Culture”. Self-supporting and independent, the only outside help
Triveni receives is a small grant from the Ministry of Education
and Culture towards the salary of the ten members of its
permanent Manipuri Dance Unit.

Recognising the importance of cinema in culture, Triveni has just
launched a Film Circle in collaboration with the National Film
Archive of India. Open to all for the moment, the Film

Circle shows two ﬁlms from the collection of the National Film
Archive on the ﬁrst and third Monday of every month. We
plan to start enrolling members for the Film Circle within

the next two months and will eventually, complement the
screenings with lectures and discussions on film history and
appreciation as well as a “library of ﬁlm books and journals.
