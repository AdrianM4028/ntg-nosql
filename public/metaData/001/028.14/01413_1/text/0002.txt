Weaving motifs of eternal value or messages with burning
immediacy on the gossamer fabric of imagination, lulling or
arousing the mind and heart with rhymes so seductive, vivif'ying
our experiences and etching its message indelibly in the sweeping
curves of awareness, the classics interpreted and re-interpreted
through the ages have never lost their lustre.

A classical dance like Manipuri echoeing the dexterous drurnbeats
of the ages and the sophisticated footsteps of a millenia through
the tunnel of uninterrupted history — deeply rooted in a living
past, still pulsating inseparany the heartbeats of this land of
Bhakti and its people, ﬁnds itself in its element to unfold the story

of Savitri.

We have

attempted

to

harness

the

variegated richness of

Manipuri, the vigorous masculinity and the delicate feminine

movements, the complex rhythmic patterns and typical melodic
modulations along with local nuances of narration for the
evergreen foliage to ﬂourish and bloom with a new fragrance.

With our heads at the feet of Gurudev and seeking the blessings
of goddess Savitri Devi, we humbly dedicate our efforts to the
indulgence of the Rasikas.
