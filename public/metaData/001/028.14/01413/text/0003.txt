SA V I TR I
Aeons back, in the mythical past, spoke a voice in a remote
forest, extolling the virtues of chastity —— a power so potent that
none other could match.
In the soothing intonation of sage Markandeya was heard the

story of Savitri, the symbol of womanly purity and sublime love
— reviving the spirits of a desolate Yudhistira.

On the advice of Narad Muni, the childless king Ashwapati
performed a Yagna to propitiate Savitri Devi.

A daughter thus

born was named after the goddess.
Growing into womanhood, of unusual beauty and attainments,
none of the suitors were found worthy of her hand. She was

ﬁnally sent with her retinue to various kingdoms to make her own
choice. Fate brought her to a forest where the banished blind
king, Dhumatsen lived with his accomplished son Satyavan.

Innocently following a ﬂock of swans, she chanced upon the
handsome Satyavan, and the search came to an end.
Back home, the news was received with great rejoicing - but was
abruptly cut short by the arrival of Narad Muni who prophesized

that Satyavan had only one year of life ‘ left.

Savitri stood

adamant, and ﬁnally the marriage was duly solemnized.
With the nagging fear of the impending doom, every setting sun

mercilessly took away a petal out of Savitri’s jealously guarded
ﬂower of life.
As the fateful day drew near, Savitri commenced a fast to forestall

the inevitable.

But finally the Day dawned and there was Yama,

the symbol of inalterable fate on his way towards the land "of
death, taking Satyavan’s soul with him.
Undaunted, Savitri

followed — and Yama unwittingly granted a boon that she may
have a hundred sons. Outwitted Yama relented on the face of
the indefatigable Sati, and gave life back to her husband Satyavan.
Thus surrnounting the invincible barrier of the ultimate, with
sheer intensity of unsullied love and
succeeded in altering the ﬂow of Time.

determination,

Savitri
