Weaving motifs of eternal value or messages with burni
g or
immediacy on the gossamer fabric of imagination, lullin
ing
arousing the mind and heart with rhymes so seductive, Vivify
our experiences and etching its message indelibly in the sweeping
ed
curves of awareness, the classics interpreted and re-interpret
through the ages have never lost their lustre.

A classical dance like Manipuri echoeing the dexterous drumbeats
of the ages and the sophisticated footsteps of a millenia through
the tunnel of uninterrupted history —— deeply rooted in a living

past, still pulsating inseparany the heartbeats of this land of
Bhakti and its people, ﬁnds itself in its element to unfold the story

of Savitri.

We have attempted to harness the variegated richness of
Manipuri, the vigorous masculinity and the delicate feminine
movements, the complex rhythmic patterns and typical melodic
modulations along with local nuances of narration for the
evergreen foliage to ﬂourish and bloom with a new fragrance.

With our heads at the feet of Gurudev and seeking the blessings
of goddess Savitri Devi, we humbly dedicate our efforts to the

indulgence of the Rasikas.
