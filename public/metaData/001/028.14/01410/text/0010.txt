THE

HILL

RESORT

OF

FLOWERS

AND

FALLS

Far from the madding crowd —- to peace and serenity.
Where nature is still nature — pure, unspoiled.
Out of this world.

The crisp sunshine and the air spiked with the scent

of wild flowers.
In the heart of the hills are cascades with magical names — Bee fall,

Duchess fall, Little fall.
Visit Pachmarhi's sixty four sites, view-points, caves temples, hill-tops,
water falls, swimming pools and cool retiring nooks or simply walk

through dappled meadow and glen to Doctor’s Delight - or do nothing
at all and do it beautifully on the undiscovered hills of Pachmarhi.
