I have sought thee 0 Self through the avenues of time
Thy footsteps have I followed down the labyrinthian years
I have felt the warm breath of thy flame in my Being

Bloomed in the tender warmth of your radiant sun
A temple did I raise to thee Self and filled it with faith
With truth and hope the altar adorned
All is plundered and fought over and made unclean
Even this jewel of life thou gavest into my hand
l knocked in vain on the doors
of the King of Darkness ‘Lord give back my Self to me
Sorrowfully then did Death make answer
Thine was the illusion, the power and the glory

The price - the extinguishing of the fiery flame
In the stillness of the sleeping night do you hear my cry

0 my beloved, my mother, my sister, my friend
Eternally I wait suspended in time, in the dead world living,
among the living - dead
