CONDUCT UNBECOMING
by Barry England
Conduct Unbecoming is set in an army mess-room in India in
the late 1 800’s. A newly-posted young officer’s attempts to
get himself cash iered draw him into a powerful court-room
drama with a macabre and dramatic climax. It is a play about
the impact of perversity—and perversion—on a rigidly
ordered and conventional military community. It is about
idealism and disillusionment. But above all it is a play about
honour, concepts of honour.
The British Theatre Group works on an amateur, non-profit
making basis. Proceeds from our productions are donated to
charity. Our aim is to give pleasure through theatre and part
of that pleasure comes from supporting causes I i ke-the Indira
Gandhi Red Cross Memorial Fund, the Save the Children
Fund and Mobile Creche.
We have been invited by the Si rnla Amateur Dramatic Club to
premiere our production of CONDUCT U NBECOMI NC at
the historic Gaiety Theatre and we are delighted at the
opportunity to perform there as part of the theatre’s Centenary
Year celebrations.
For the Delhi performances of CONDUCT U NBECOMING
we return after some years to Our traditional venue, the
AIFACS Auditorium. Our international cast and crew
includes citizens of Delhi, members of the British, Australian
and Canadian High Commissions and, appropriately, a
representative of the United Nations.
On behalf of us all,

WELCOME TO THE SHOW
