Employment for 5.5 Iakh more has
been generated indirectly by our
operations. They are the trade in
general. They are our suppliers
and professional agencies and
transport and other tertiary services.
They also include the several
thousand people in the 110 small

scale sector units we have helped
to develop.
Further self—employment
opportunities have been createc
by our novel Jai Jawan Stalls
Scheme, first started in 1966.

Our efforts indeed are humble :
but if they go even a small way
towards helping national interests,
we shall have served our purpose.
