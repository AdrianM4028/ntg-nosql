A woman’s struggle for identity

Aandhar Yatra
This play, set in eastern Maharashtra, is about
those who are concerned about society and
values. Undoubtedly a serious political play, it
presents an insight into the salient trends of
the Indian political situation while depicting the
frustrations of an Indian woman to retain
independence. Vasundhara after being battered
by treatment as a commodity vehemently leads
an independent parallel life and relationships
with Daulatrao, a senior politician, Shreepad
a Marxist intellectual, and Ashwath a young
student with Naxalite Syrnpathies. She resists
their efforts to dominate her existence and
thoughts, but ultimately finds herself in a
passage to darkness — Andhar Yatra.
This is the first directorial venture of the
play-wright of this play Prof. Govind Deshpande
of Jawaharlal Nehru University, who is a
wellknown authority on Marxism and has a
serious interest in theatre, literature and also

Indian Mythology.
The sets are designed by a noted Sculptor
designer, John D. Antone from Washington
DC, USA.

The person who actually made the drama

successful is Shyamanand Jalan . .... It is a pity
Shyamanand Jalan and Chetna Jalan in the
lead roles along with Vinay Sharma, B.M.
Hada, Pradip Roy, Dinesh Poddar and others.

that now a days one can rarely see the acting
of such a great actor
his diplomatic yet

controlled acting will long remain in the memory
of the audience.

Daulat Rao is played by Shyamanand Jalan
with all the marvels under his command. He
is one of our finest actors... Chetna does a

splendid job. She creates several genuine
theatrical moments.
