An innovative translation of Dario Fo's

'Accidental Death of An Anarchist’ the play is
a sensational political farce which absorbs social
indignation into the realm of mainstream
comedy. The play is a satire on police corruption.
It concerns the case of an Anarchist railway
worker who, it is claimed, ’fell' to his death
from the fourth floor of police headquarters
during interrogation. The farcical capers of the
play’s situation finally build up into a comic
frenzy but end up in a hard—hitting c irnax which
indicts the entire system.

The policemen, played by Vinay Sharma, B. M .

Hada, and Kunal Padhi carryout some
synchronised slapstick on the stage—the farcical
treatment being very effective in portraying
their viciousness.

If you like your politics pink and your laugh
black, because you’ve lost your purple rage
against the system to those effervescent
university days of long ago, Padatik’s Ek
Anarchist Ki lttefaqia Maut is for you. And

never mind the critics.
