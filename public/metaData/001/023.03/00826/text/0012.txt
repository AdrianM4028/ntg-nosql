A play in which nothing happens, twice

Godot Ka lntezaar Karte Huye....
An audience—friendly Hindi Translation of
'Waiting For Godot’ by Nobel Prize winning
playwright Samuel Beckett.
The play initially met with incornprehension from
its audiences in the early 1 950's, who were taken
aback by its' lack of conventional theme, plot or
structure.
But within a decade 'Waiting for Godot’, with its
distinct note of comic sadness, became a
modern c assic swiftly traversing the distance
from avant-garde to mainstream theatre.

The play asks nothing in point, it forces no
dramatized moral on the viewer, it holds out no
specific hope. . . . .we’re all waiting for Godot and

shall continue to wait. When the scenery gets
too drab and the action too slow, we’ll call each
other names and swear to part forever-but then

there’s no place to go.
Directed and translated by Vinay Shanna. The
light designed by Joy Sen and sets are designed
by Vinay Sharma and Dinesh Poddar.
The cast comprises Shakil Khan, Kunal Padhi,_
Mahmud Alam, B.M. Hada and Vinay Sharma.

l n performance and in technique the
presentation was extraordinary.

Theatre at its best.

Godot .... .. has been enacted so many times
that a fresh interpretation would seem quite
impossible. But .... Sharma has achieved just
that by presenting the play in a light that it

।ndian, contemporary and different.

The best of Hindi theatre in Calcutta is now

more than a match for the best of Bengali
theatre, Padatik’s Godot .... reconfirms that
there are no substitutes for hard work and
careful throught in a production.
