Can man be reallyfreefrom women's Domination — A war of Sexes

Sakharam Binder
A controversial play with Kulbhushan Kharbanda
in the title role. An explosive production which
has attracted people for its scathing attack on
moral hypocrisy.
The story of a middle aged man who does
not believe in love, trust, support or other
emotional values in the man-woman relationship.
He believes the basis as fulfilment of mutual
needs—material and physical.
Its original production in Bombay was banned
by the Maharashtra Government. However, after
court order, the ban was lifted and it was
staged from time to time in many languages
almost all over India.
This production has completed 50 shows in
Calcutta and other places before packed houses.
Written by Vijay Tendulkar, translated by
Sarojini Verma directed by Shyamanand Jalan
with Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Chetna Jalan,
Baishakhi Mariit, Pradip Roy and Shakil
Khan in the cast.

The production took Calcutta by storm.

The main asset of this production is excellent
acting by all the actors and actresses.
Kulbhushan proved that i nspite of being a busy
film actor how much free on the stage he is still.

Shyamanand deserves credit for taking up the
challenge of such a controversial play and
rendering it with an interpretation and
spontaneity that makes it all the more relevant
today. Chetna Jalan as Lakshmi, is especially
impressive in her monologue.

Business Standard, 31 .391
In the climatic scene she (Chetna Jalan)
performed intenser revealing a clever a practical
woman. Baishakhi Marijit, Pradip Roy and Shakil
Khan acted cornmendably.

Shyamanand Jalan (director), Jayanto
Chowdhury (set designer), Subroto Majumdar
(lights) and Dinesh Poddar (Stage Manager) all
are due credit for the zingy sting of the Binder
tale. And many thanks Padatik.....for a
memorable experience.
