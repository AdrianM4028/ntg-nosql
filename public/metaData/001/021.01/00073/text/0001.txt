As you know well in Delhi we have started a residential

theatre.

We have improvised some platforms to enact short

plays.
Our activities include play—reading and poetry recita—
tion, it is purely a non—commercial effort.
We can accommodate

50 viewers by invitation.
If you are interested please write

send you monthly schedule.

This year in August we have staged 3 plays DHAKKA-PUhP, RALBAN
तो SHAIYA.
I am enclosing herewith the programmes on 1hth and
