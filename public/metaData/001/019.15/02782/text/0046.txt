There is also a specific method for
relating the actor's role to the play. The
play is analyzed for it's main action and
each character is then assigned a
subsidary action. The subsidiary action
is in turn broken down into minor
variations of actions from scene to scene

accumulation of detail served to make
purely naturalistic productions uninspired
and dull. Among the more creative men
of theatre pure Naturalism had a
surprisingly short run. Antonie, whilst
inisting on accuracy and probablility,
was too great an artist to exclude the
element of disticlive design. Stanislavsky.
Ibsen and Chekhov too, move away
from the limitation of strict naturalism.
For naturalisrn, as soon as it grew
