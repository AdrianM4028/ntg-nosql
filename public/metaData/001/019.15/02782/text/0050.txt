All men must answer in their lives

Those question whose
enormous

answers

are

Because when one man decides how he
lives

How we eat decides iustice
Our homes measure the perversion of
science
Our love controls the meaning of words
And art is wheatever looks closely.
in the human face.

He changes all men's lives.
There are no small questions for small
men
All men are Hamlet on an empty street
Or a windy quay
All men are Lear in the market.
When the tradesmen have gone.
No man eats sleeps or loves for himself
alone
Harvest and dreams and teaching the
young
Don‘t take place in a small room.

If there were only irrational ways.
To make the world rational.
Art would still be reason.
And so our race not left to rot in the
rnadhouse
Reason is the mark of kin

Poetry destroys illusions and

doesn't

create them

And hope is a passion that will not let
men.
Rest in asylum's peace.

But in the spaces of other men‘s lives.
Edward Bond.
