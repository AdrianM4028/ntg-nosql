On the opposite side of the stage,
at the point where the hanamichi meets

the main stage, hidden behind a piece
of scenery, is anoher group of musicians
who use an extremely large variety of
musical instruments to add to the
atmosphere of the plays. here also they
use the shamisen, as well as flutes and
many kinds of drums. This sound effect
music is known as the geza.
Thus we see that Kabuki is an
extremely musically oriented theatre,
with its Gidau-bushi, its geza and its
hyoshigi. This great variety of sound is
the point upon A which the general
opinion that Kabuki is pure musical
theatre is based. Another aspect that
adds to the impression of total musicality
in Kabuki is the rhythmical, almost
chanted, stylized delivery of dialogue by
the actors.
Now we move on to the second

piece on our program. When the curtain
opens, we see a single large pine tree

painted on the backdrop. Also we see
a low platform of unfinished wood
spread all across the stage. This
platform is always used in dancedramas
to help the feet of the dancers slide
smoothly and to resound with a pleasent
sound when they stamp their feet to
accent their dancing. lnfront of the
backdrop with the ,pine tree painted on
it is a long narrow platform covered with
red felt, with the nagauta musicians
sitting on top in a single row. Those on

the left half of the platform are singers

saw today, the Nagauta style of music
is very lyrical and impressionistic in
content. This poetic nature of Nagauta
music is the reason it is widely used to

accompany Kabuki dance-dramas. There
are also, however ~ dance-drama that
are accompanied by Kiyomoto, Tokiwazu
and Gidayubushi and some that use a
combination of two or more of these
styles of music in an antiphonol
style‘.
The maior characters enter me
stage from the hanamichi. This
hanamischi is not merely a passage way
for entrances and exits, but an extension

of the acting area. Thus whenever a
character enters on the hanamichi, he
stops at a set position near the stage
to perform a small scene before he
enters the main stage. In this pldy, we
see the hero and his retainers ‘come
down the hanamichi in single filek on
their way to the barrier gate. As they
walk along their way, they discuss how
they are going to go about getting safely
through the barrier gate. This takes
place on the hanamichi.
This dance-drama is based on a
Nolri drama. the simple set with the
single pine tree painted on the backdrop
is an imitation of the Noh stage. The

platform for the Nagauta orchestra and
chorus is the only piece of furniture on
the stage. The whole piece is based on
the conventions of the Noh drama from
which it was derived.
The last play on our program is an

an orchestra as we saw in the first two
pieces today. As the curtain opens, We

as many as twenty musicians. On the

original drama that was written for
Kabuki. There is no platform here for

and those on the right half are shamisen
players. They vary in numbers from the
piece to piece but sometimes there are

floor in front of these musicians, also
in a single row are seated the drummers
and flute players.
In contrast to the narrative nature

of the Gidayu-bushi of the first piece we
