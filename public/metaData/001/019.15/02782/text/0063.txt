the left hand side. it is known as the
hanamichi. This staging device is used
so much and so effectively in Kabuki
that it almost seems as through kabuki
could not be presented without it. In any
case, it is safe to state that since the
hanamichi is not used in any other type
of drama, if the show you see has a
hanamichi, it is quite certain to be
Kabuki

Another aspect of the stage that
immediately attracts the eye is the draw
curtain which is dyed in vertical stripes
of black, green and brown. It is called
the ioshiki maku and is one more of
those things that are unique to Kabuki.
Lively drums begin to beat a rhythm
to let us know that it is almost time for
the show to begin and when it ends,
there are two sharp clacks of the
hyoshigi to tell us that the time has

come to open the curtain. The hyoshigi
is a simple instrument consisting of two
46

short sticks of oak wood and it plays
a very important role in Kabuki as asignal for all points of climax and
progress in the plays.
And now it is curtain time. the
hyoshigi beats very slowly and than
progressively faster as the draw curtain
is pulled back from left to right to reveal
the set for the first piece on today’s
programme. The first thing we notice
is the Gidayu-bushi narrator and his
sharnisen accompanist seated on their
small platform on the right hand side
of the state. These musicians comment
on the emotional state of the characters
and the scene taking place, between the
lines of dialogue delivered by the actors.
The nusic they perform is a type of
Joruri known as Gidayu-bushi. These
musicians are always present in plays,
