reality, even reality itself, is‘ som
e how
wrong on stage and that the met
hod
sponsored by Zola had lost its way,
it
had become the letter without the spirit
.
All its carefully verified facts revealed
only that it no longer contained a central
meaning.

And so, realism/naturalism gave rise
to symbolism, which started as a scenic
philosophy which attempted to go
beyond merely photographic reality.
Adolphe Appia and Gordoncraig were
the designers whose theories greaty.
Influenced thaeatre and gave weight to
the ideal of symbolism. Where the
naturalists tried to intergrate the actor
and the setting. Appia went further and
subordinated the setting to the actor. For
him the main function or the setting was
to provide a space which would best
reveal the actor and reflect his emotions.
The stage must not show a forest with
Siegfried in it but Siegfried in a forest.
The main principals of symbolism were
: simplification of effect and of means:

a proper relationship of actor to
background : suggestion and synthesis
a complex and rythrnic fusion of setting,
lights, actors and play.
One of the ideas shared by Appia
and Craig was that the deigner should
pick out the one or two most dominant
images of the play and construct of
these a setting which will symbolize the
whole.
It is interesting that such masters of
dramatic naturalism such as Strindberg
and Ibsen were also the innovators of
symbolist dramaturgy. This paradox is
explained in part by the Limitations of
nutrualism which we have already noted
It is not surprising that many of the most
gifted naturalistic playrights turned to a
different form when they wished to show
life at it's fullest, In this alternative
technique, life, documented and certified,

become only a symbol of some deeper
significance which the dramatist wished
to make clear. The immediate dramatic
action must be reinterpreted on a higher
