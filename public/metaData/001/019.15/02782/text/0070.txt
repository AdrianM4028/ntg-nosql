I am a play wright I show
What I have seen. In mankind's
markets.
I have seen how humanity is
traded. That
I show, I, the play Wright,
How they step in to each others
rooms with Schemes
Or rubber trunchernons,

or with cash
How they stand in the streets
and wait
How they lay traps for each
other and wait.
Full I hope
How they make appointments

How they
How they
How they
How they
I ‘show all

fasten on each others
make love.
safeguard the loot

that

The words which they call to
each other I report
What the mother tells her son
What the under taking asks of
those it takes under
What the wife replies her ३
husband.
All the begging words, all the
commanding
The grovelling, the misleading
The lying, the unknowing
The winning, the wounding
I report them all.

And will there be singing in the dark

yes, there will be singing of the dark
times.

The lighting
Electrician
Give us light on our stage
How can we disclose
We plays wrights and actors
Images to the world
in Semidarkness हैं
The sleepy twilight sends to
sleep.
Yet we need our watchers wide
awake
Indeed we need them vigilant
let them dream in brigntness.
The little bit
Of night-that's wanted now and
then
Our lamps and noon can
indicate.
And we with our acting too can
keep
The times of clay apart.
The Elizabethan woole us
Verses on a heath at eventing
Which no lights will ever reach
Nor even the health itself
embrace
Therefore flood full on
What we have made with work
That the watcher may see
The indignant peasant

Sit down upon the soil of
Tavastland
As though it were her own
Bertolt Brecht
