Dear Mr.Mahajan.
the

It gives me immense pleasue to know that

"Santh

Theatre”

is

going

to

stage

a

play

namely ‘Sainya Bhaye Kotwal’ on 15th and 16th
March. i997. In fact this type of activity besides
providing

recreation

to

the

common

masses

can

surely develop a great inclination towards the Art
and Culture amongst the young generation.
As the
work of the theatre has been appreciated . in past
this play will prove another feather in the cap of

l’Samooh”. Moreover. the peOple of the State have
suffered a lot
on the hands of anti social
elements
these activities can play a lead role in
bringing
the people of the State together. thus
starting a new chapter of communal

harmony and

National Integration.
I wish the organisers all the best.

Yours sincerely.
