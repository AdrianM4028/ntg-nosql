of iob to her brother. Pardhan takes it as an opportune time to
adjust his brotherâ€”In-Iaw. He announces that his brother-in-Iaw win

because pardhan's brother-ln-Iaw is not the right person. He is
not even physically fit for the post. But the Hawaldar is helpless,
because this has been announced by the Pardhan/Bureaucrat. He

can not marry his beloved as he had promised her that he will
marry her after getting the promotion of 'Kotwal'
We see that tavouritisrn is cause of disturbance. It not only disturbs
the Hawaldar but also disturbs his beloved and Sipahi Hawaldar
is not getting promotion and he alongwith his beloved remains
bachelor, and Sipahi has to remain Sipahi (The same is happening

may be one of the cause of, unemployment terrorism, blood shed,
Militancy, Dacoity, Frustration, depression among the youth

We are a free country from the last titty years. There is no foreign

is prevailing. Many Hawalders, many Mainas and many Sipahls
become the victims of the acts of Pradhans even to day.
