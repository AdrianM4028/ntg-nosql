It, indeed, gives great pleasure to
me to know about the summer theatre
festival having been organised by the
Samooh Theatre, Jammu, headed by
the young stage enthusiast Mr. Sudhir
Mahaian. Although a new entrant in the
field, set up only in l 994, it has already

worthwhile venture, which is also roping

in more and more talent, among whom
Samooh Theatre is perhaps the latest
addition. That within such a shortispan
of time it could put up so many shows,
workshops and a theatre festival, to
boot, shows how studiously they are

performing and they must be having
good response from spectators also.

only since after 1980’s that modern
theatre had started shaping up here
both on stage or as street theatre.
During this very period some of the local
theatre groups had also ventured
