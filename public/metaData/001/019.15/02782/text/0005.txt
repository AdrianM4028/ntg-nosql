v FOREWORD
Theatre scene in Jammu has undergone a significant change with the inception of new
theatre groups run by qualified experienced and committed theatre Directors who want to do
new experiments in theatre. Theatre of Jammu has made a place in the National Theatre map
of the country with new experimental productions which have received rave reviews by the
top theatre experts. Most of the new theatre works undertaken by theatre directors of our
generation have been inspired by the traditional performing arts of this region. My experience
in theatre has given a new revelation and understanding of how theatre activities of our region
have developed into a very powerful form effectively. New forms have been evolved through
the cross fertilisation of traditional performing modes and modern theatretechniques with the
motive to establish a new base for contemporary I ndian theatre.
l n this backdrop a theatre group, Samooh Theatre was formed in 1994 by Mr. Sudhir
Mahajan, a committed theatre worker of Jammu and Kashmir who had histraining in Theatre
from Indian Theatre department, Chandigarh. Samooh I theatre started with the motive to
have a professional base for theatre in Jammu. As full time theatre Director Sudhir initiated

many projects relating to the development of theatre in Jammu. Many workshops training
programmes were conducted by Samooh theatre since 1994. I am of the opinion that one
cannot contribute in theatre in a better way unless one puts in whole heartedly in theatre. Mr.

Sudhir Mahajan has set that example. He might have faced many hardships in his struggle
but I am sure that his efforts will not go waste. To educate our worthy audience about various
aspects of theatre and theatre of Jammu and Kashmir, many articles have been included in
this souvenir.
Wishing yOu a very interesting and meaningful reading.
