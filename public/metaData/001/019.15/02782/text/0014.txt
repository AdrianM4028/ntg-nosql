problems it is too little 0 time
yet with our continuous efforts and with spirit of service we have been able
take
to out a place for our group though not too broad, yet strong enough to
our movement forward.
In the past three years we have been able to hold 36 shows of plays like
'Singhasan Khali Hai', ‘Andher Nagari' , 'Sainya Bhaye Kotwal', 'Hawalat',
'Good Bye Swami', 'Maranprant', 'Matvilas' etc. in many parts of the Jammu
region including far-flung areas. Besides, we have performed in Chandigarh
also many of these plays have been staged with the help of amateur artists
including children and with active Support of iammu and Kashmir Academy
ofArt, Culture and Languages, Jamrnu and North Zone cultural Centre, Patiala.
Always keeping the aims and obiectives of our group i .e to develop regional
theatre, to run children's theatre festivals we will continue to take up the issues
of concern by presenting plays before the people particularly the rural folks.
Despite financial constrains, we will continue to work for our sacred mission _
by holding theatre Camps/workshops and organising street plays, so as to
educate and make people aware, besides saving the theatre particulary
regional theatre from further erosion.
