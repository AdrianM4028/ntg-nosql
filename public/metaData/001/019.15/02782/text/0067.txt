factors relate to each other to create the

fixed expressiveness of the whole.
Thus the acting techniques, which
began in a realistic style, have become
set in accordance with these rules of
Kabuki and forced into a stylized
framework. For example, even the wig
were fashioned after the hair styles of
the people of the Edo Period, but they
have been beautifully re-styled in kabuki
to fit and contribute to the expression
of the character that is to wear it . This
is also true in the expression of such
sounds to nature as rain, wind, waves,

as well as the evocation of such
emotional atmospheric feelings as fear
and uncanniness, which are all produced on the large drum called the
odaiko.
Further, it must not be forgotten that
one more aspect of the stylized beauty
of Kabuki is the careful harmonization
50

and variation of color.
This careful
matching and combination of colors is
particularly evident in the design of the
costumes. Variations are brought about
by the putting on and taking off of
cloaks and other outer garments
and these variations are carefully
harmonized mutually among all
characters on the stage. Also the colour
balance between the costumes and the
set they appear in has been carefully
plotted as well.
Kabuki is a complexly stylized
classical theatre genre that is made
gorgeous and opulent by the refinement
and harmony of its three aesthetic
aspects of form, sound and color and
owes the depth and meaning fulness of
its dramatic content to the inclusion and
assimilation of a myriad different
performing arts, over a period of
several centuries.
