Keeping the carrots of aims and
aspirations on their noses like the
mules who lift heavy loads the
theatrists of the city of temples have
tried to give what ever possible within
the given limitations. In the first half
of the present decade particulary in
the first three years we have witnessed
plays of highest quality in Jammu. A
few plays from Natrang, ATG,
Rangyug will be remembered by the
lovers of meaningful theatre for many
decades to come. In the concluding
years of the first half of the current
decade a few directors from other
states staged plays of lighter vein.
They too captivated the audience.
Kanioos by Adil Hussain of Assam and
Andhon Ka Hathi by Mr. Nayar are
the examples in this regard. Directors
of our state should take a cue from
the success of such plays and should
recite mantra of attracting audience

by humourous plays. TV. has already

learnt the art of captivating the
viewers by humourous plays as a
number of such plays in the form of
serials are being telecast presently.
So first task is to attract the
viewers by humorous plays and once
they again develop taste for the
theatre, present the meaningful
plays.
At the same time one must agree

that the fruitful development of theatre
is not only the responsibility of the
theatrist. The people and agencies
who are not so closely attached with
theatre have also to do their bit in
this ragard. The writers of our state
have unfortunately gone the ’on the
stage performers' way.
They are
happy in writing the scripts which
are loose but fetch them good bucks.
They write for the channels which are
not popular among the people but
avoid writing for stage with the
