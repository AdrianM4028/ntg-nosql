It
is an established fact that Theater movement from ancient times in all the nations has played
a
significant
role
in
educating
masses,for
bringing
Socio—Economic
and Cultural
transformation
in
the
societies.Theater movement has also been instrumental in
organising
freedom struggle in our
country.Besides,the
stage plays are effective in moulding public opinion and
have
proved helpful in bringing
social
reforms,wiping
out evils from society and inculcating voluntary character in youth.
The
performance of the SAMOOH
Theater during
last two years is very encouraging and appreciable too.I
wish this Theater group a grand success in its ambitious
goal
of fostering amity,brotherhood and integration
in
society"which is the prime need of the hour
inview of
present» tendencies of materialism which
have
affected
moral.values in the entire World.
