Kabuki and modern theatre continued
up until the first half of the 19405.
The Japan started the pacific War
and Kabuki became distorted by the
government policy of insisting on a war
consciousness on the stage, and the
after Japan’s defeat in that war, it was
feared at one point that kabuki would
become completely extinct. However,
since T960, it has experienced a
brilliant post-war
renaissance. The
older performers who were active in
५ pre-war days gradually died off, but the
Japanese respect for tradition prevailed
with its famous persistence and brought
about the renaissance of not only
Kubuki, but of the whole spectrum of
Japan’s classical theatre arts. And even
today, Kabuki maintains its importance
as the mainstream of Japanese classical
performing arts, and lives on as a
superior traditional art form.

Kabuki is. often said to be like a
beast with the head of a lion, the body

याँ a goat and the toil of a dragon. As
mentioned earlier, Kabuki originated as
a song and dance revue type show and
later introduced many aspects from the
older theatre forms, particularly Noh
and Kyogen. Even later in its history, it
was strongly influenced by the puppet
theatre stylelwe know today as Bunraku,
to the extent that a great deal of its
repertoire is made up of scripts
borrowed directly from Bunraku. And its

further development into the complex,
highly refined art we know today was
embellished by the introduction of a

history of its development.

All of this

taking the reader on an imaginary tour
of a performance. First we enter the
theatre, take our seats, and open our

programme.

The first piece on the

programme for today is to be a single
act that tells the tragic story of warrior
who finds it necessary to sacrifice his
own child in order to save the life of
his lord. This is one of those script that
we borrowed from the bunraku puppet
theatre. The period represented here is
during the role of the warrior class, and
the hero is a member of that class. The
second play is a dance-drama that tells
of a great general who hides his identity
in order to pass through a barrier gate
with his retainers. This play was
adapted from a Noh drama. Here we
find that it is accompanied by Nagauta

singing and the shamisen. ‘ The _third
part of to'day’s show is a drama about
a gangster who dresses as a young girl
and goes to a dry goods shop to carry
out a clever swindle plan. Thus the

is the

merchant’s place of

business and home. the characters in
this play are all commoners and
merchants this is the only piece on our
programe today that was originally
written for Kabuki.
It was created
around the middle of the 1 9th century.
Thus each of the pieces on this

triple programme are from a different
source, and they represent three differ-

ent styles of Kabuki.
As we look up from our programms,
we see that there is a raised passageway of about 160 centimeters in width
