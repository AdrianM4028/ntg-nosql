PARSI THEATRE: SOME MEMORIES
Theatre companies coming from
England resulted in the establishment of
parsi theatre companies, after having
seen their plays. Those companies
would come from England, get off at
Bombay and perform. Parsi used to go
to see their plays and inspired by them
they formed their own companies and
began performing in the style of
Shakespearean plays. Those days the
artistes of the English theatre used to
speak very loudly, they had tremendous
energy. That's how the Parsi theatre
companies Plays adopted the style of
loud delivery of dialogues.
Chairishrna was a speciality of the
parsi theatre and it was used for
attracting people. Through chairishma
one can lure any one. In the Parsi
theatre chairishma is our unique thing.
This had nothing to do with the theatre
of Shakespeare.
There was a scene of chopping off
of Ganeshii head. Now Ganeshii head
has to be chopped off so what they used
to do was
normally a man's height
is about five feet but they would look
for a boy is three and a half. He was
fitted with body made from an ironstrip. For sticking out the hands the
body was fitted on to him on both the
sides. They would get the whole body
painted including the artifical head and
fitted on the boy. Inside they would stuff
pieces of cloth dipped in plenty of red
colour. Now that boy would stand in the
wings, on the other side. Here,

on

stage, Shanker tells Ganesh - I shall go.‘
No my mother is having her bath, I
won't let you. This altercation takes
place three-four times, hence the angry
Shankar pushes Ganesh and pushes
26

him so hard that he goes into the wings.
He comes out again and says :
'No, I won't relent. Two three rounds
are done. Third time, instead of the real

Ganesh the other boy comes out. People
could not differentiate because he too
is wearing the same costume and
headgear. So the third time he doesn't
come and Shankar hurls his trishul at
him and his head falls on to the ground,
so does the boy in pain. The pieces of
cloth stuffed inside the head become
visible and it seems as if the blood is
oozing out. Those days the public never
used to go into .he details. Nowdays,

let the head be actually chopped off and
the people would suspect, and not
believe even in truth. Truly people did
not under stand so much in those days.
There is the role of Krishna, women

have come to see the play and have
brought sweets with them. They place
the sweets at the artistes feet. Wow, that

was really wonderful. The entire company
would have its fill of sweets. There used
to be so much of it. Those were the

days.
Actor-training and for attaining the
required standard of play performance
singing was compulsory for all actors.
Exercises for fencing, fights, use of
sticks, wrestling, dancing etc. were
conducted everyday. Most important
was the training in rendering the
dialogues at a higher pitch, in a special
way, the body movement using the
hands and the feet with perfection and
speaking the lines and the part in a
lyrical manners.
In pricipal, the owners of the parsi
theatre

companies
