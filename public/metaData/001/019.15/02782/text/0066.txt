music from the geza enclosure,
underscoring the scene and adding to
the feeling of a bustling part of old Edo.
Finally a young lady (actually a
gangster dressed in female garments)
comes down the hanamichi accompanied
by two male companions. Of course, we
are already aware that all female roles
in Kabuki are played by male actors.
Actors who specialize in the
performance of female roles in Kabuki
are called onnagata. We have already
discussed the origin of the art of these
female impersonatiors, but let us stop
here for a movement to consider a few
more interesting facets of this art. The
techniques of female impersonation
were quite completely perfected by the
time the dramatic content of the plays
of kabuki had reached its full
development, around the beginning of
the 18th century. there are many
documents passed down to us today
that tell of the difficult lives led by the
onnagatge of the Edo Period who
attempted to perfect their stagecraft by
living like women even in their daily
lives off stage. The aesthetics of ferninity
thus attained were particularly stressed
on

the

stage,

making

these actors

appear even more graceful and
charming than real women. This gave
rise to the peculiar phenomenon in

which the Kabuki onnagata took the
lead in setting the styles and fads in
women’s clothing makeup and accessory
fashions. Thus the onnagata became
one of Kabuki’s greatest crowd-drawing
powers and one of its most important
aesthetic factors.
But back to our play.... Suddenly the
young lady, who had come to the shop
ostensibly to buy kimono material,
reveals that she is really a young man
and not only a man, but a gangster

of the shop. The gangster introduces
himself to the shocked merchant in a
pompous declarnatory manner. This
speech is very rhythmical and florid.
Speeches of this kind are found in
almost all Kabuki plays and they"provide
an opportunity to display the actor’s
virtuosity. For instance, in the first piece
on our programrn, the hero explains his
painful decision to sacrifice his own
child in place of his lord in a speech
of this type.
Kabuki is often spoken of as a
stylized theatre genre. Since it developed
in a period when social status was
rigidly delineated, part of the stylization
is due to the placement of characters
on the stage in any given scene, which
is always decided in accordance ,with
strict rules of social protocol. Alsd, all

stage conventions are securely fixed nd

variations are never allowed.

example,
closed at the end of a scene or act, all

activity is stopped and everyone strikes
a pose, presenting a still picture of
tableau effect. The poses of the various
actors in this picture must be executed
in sUch a manner that they contribute
to the compositional balance of the
whole. Thus, through a very long period
of experimentation, the position and
pose of each character in these scenes
has, been fixed. In kabuki these poses
and positions are called kata.
In present day .Kabuki, these kata
are absolutely immovable and there is
no room for the creation of new kata.
This gives rise to the problem of iust
how much meaning these old kata have
to audiences today. The kata include not
only the poses and positions mentioned
above, but also the costumes, wig,
delivery of lines and the music that
