or merely colour and luxury, and in fact
they modified realism which benitited
from these revolts. But where the others
were simple opponents of naturalisrn,
Brecht was its rival. Like Zola he wanted
to bring social and moral problems on
to the stage, but Zola hoped to make
the spectators take the problem seriously
by involving him in it whereas Brecht
wanted to surprise him by detatching
him from it until he could view it cooly
with unmisted eyes. To convience the
spectator that the problem was a real
one the naturalists used on accumuiation
of detail Brecht maintained that it would
only be done by a selection of detail.
And with Selection comes the element
of style which is lacking in pure realism.
Which brings us to question of the
validity of doing a realistic play today.
For in the west, where realism orginated,
it has been left far behind it is

considered limited in its approach and
expression. In India the basic
temperament

is

more

conducive

to

deliberate stylization of which we have
a long standing tradition in both our
classical as well as folk plays. So why
should we do plays of the type which
the orginators themselves have left
behind. The answer seems to be that
at a stage where theatre practitioners
are searching for a modern idiom, it is
not possible, for students especially, to
ignore or bypass realism, which is the
basis of so much that is modern in
theatre to day. Eventually one may reiect
realism and evolve or decide in favour
of another style but in order to make
even that decision a valid one, it is

neccssary to experence realism first, and
to try and absorb it's admirable qualities
of which there are not a few.
