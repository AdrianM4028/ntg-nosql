We have few committed actors and they
work with dedication and zest. At times
due to the nonavailability of some actors
the dramatic clubs suffer a lot. Some of
the productions are also closed due to
nonavailability of good actors. Actors
should not become part of the maddening
race and must realise their role in the
society. For the amateur theatrists there is
a bright future and they should not get
discouraged by the small hassles which
they can easily overcome with dedication
and devotion. Theatre itself has a very
bright tuture, it taken in its true spirit and
with a will to work instead of looking
towards greener pastures alone.
The State Government is doing its
best to boost the theatre movement like
in other states but the dedicated theatrists
do not only wait and see! They forge
ahead with whatever little resources
they have. That should be the spirit.
