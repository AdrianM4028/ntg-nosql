बि

from that of Romantic players who
regulary signed their parts on the gas
flame of the footlights. With Antoine,
actors had to learn to speak and move
like ordinary human beings in ordinary
environments not like idealized or typical
characters on a platform Speech had to
include the tentativeness of speech in
ordinary life. Suggestion of emotion
rather than full expression was required
and silence was as important as speech.
The actor had to speak to his fellows,
not to the audience. His gestures could
not be obviously designed but
characterized by the tentativeness and
when appropriate to the role, the awk
wardness of gestures in life. Like speech,
gestures were meant to give the illusion
of complete spontaniety. The actor was
supposed to stay in the setting and not
to advance to the footlights when giving
an important speech. He could not pace
from on e side of the stage to the other

but was supposed to use the furniture
as a character would in life. He did not
invariany face front or partly front, but
occasionally turned his back to the
audience when a character might
naturally do so. The actor did not
attempt to play the part but to live it.
For Stanislavski, the ideal of the new
actor was to "creep into the skin and
body" of the character he portrayed.
And realistic actors are indebted to
Stanislavski for a detailed analysis of the
technique whereby this is possible. The
most important point in his system is the
actor's duty of finding an 'inner
iustification' for any action he perfoms.
For example it is not sufficient for an
actor playing an old man to mimic the
behaviour of an old man the actor must
look within himself for an emotional or
imaginative
sensation
which
approximates the stage of mind of an
old man.
