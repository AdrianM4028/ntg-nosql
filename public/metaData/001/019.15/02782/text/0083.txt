relentlessly
praying and trying for a child who
could take the sinking ship of Jammu
theatre safely to shore. Many of my
friends more so the ’Optimistic’ friends
may not agree with the above remarks
but they will candidly agree that if the
theatre ship is not sinking it is not

sailing smoothly. Before coming to any
other conclusion let us cast a look on
the ’achievements’ of Jammu theatre.
For performing plays only one venue
’Abhinav Theatre’ is available, may be
in coming century we will have another
temple for worship of theatre. The sole
art

centre needs renovation.

The basic infrastructure for
producing plays and dramas is not
available neither is anyone bothered
to build one for raising a towering
building of theatre. Quality of plays
of late has increased but quanity of
plays performed in a year has
drastrically come down killing the
efforts of those theatrists which produce
or try to produce quality plays. The
gavernment measures for good health
of theatre have increased with the
coming of a professional theatrist as
Secretary of Academy of Art, Culture
Grid Languages yet the government

has to do a lot as Jammu Theatre is
still living under poverty line.

Another problem which the Jammu
theatre is facing is scarcity of
performers as most of the artists have
defected to the Television. The later
pays them good money for iust a few
shots while days and nights put
together for a stage play fetches
acidity and curse from parents. At the
same time there is no denying to the
fact that at many other places in the
country, theatre has a weak commercial
base.

But some is not true for Jammu

as many plays of Natrang, Rangyug
and Ameature Theatre Group were
sold and some of the plays were sold
house full yet the ’Karkuns’ of Jammu
theatre never tried to consolidate the
commercial base. The well wishers
promoters and producers should bear
in mind that hankering after
government schemes or some petty

serial producers will never help their
pious cause. The structure of theatre
which was built by hard labour is
crumbling and all the good men
should come to its rescue.
India has stepped into 50th year
of Independence and our country
has made rapid strides in many
fields but in our state of Jammu and
Kashmir theatre is facing slow
death. In Kashmir whose soil was
made fertile by efforts of our elders
and in Jammu there are no new takers
for theatre. The group of theatrists has
failed to increase its strength while
some have contrarily deserted it.
Gone are the days when hall used to
be filled with theatre
lovers well
before the mentioned time of start.
Despite all these short comings
and limitations the Jammu theatre
people have tried to keep the flag
wafting with the slogan, "The show
must go on".
