"Education can and must bring
about the fine synthesis between change
oriented technologies and the country's
continuity of cultural tradition. The
curricula and processes of education will
be enriched by cultural content in as
many manifestations as possible.
Children will be enabled to develop
sensitivity to beauty, harmony and
refinement."
Drama is the best art from which
can fulfil the task of developing
sensitivity to beauty, harmony and
refinement. It consists of both individual
and group sensitivity. It is a platform for
free expression to children of various
Socio-economic backgrounds where they
all unite and perform; thus promoting
social and emotional integration. India
is a country of diversities in languages,
culture, traditions, etc. Drama provides
children to minimize these diversities
and bring about "national integrationâ€™.
Drama has a two fold task in
making learning purposeful and on
enjoyable experience viz.
(i) Children learn while 'Playing' different
roles.

There is a great need of making
learning a pleasant and enjoyable
experience for children. Since drama
depends upon individual's emotions and
feeling; it gives free experssion to the
child; it accelerates his/her motivation to

explore new ideas and knowledge; there
by bringing changes in his pursuit for
new knowledge and learning. Such
change are not possible through
conventional classroom teaching
methods at the primary level. Participation
in the dramatic process thus involves the
children in experimental, expressive and
communicative modes of action.
Hence, drama must be recognised
as a 'subiect' in the modern curriculum
and a teaching method to bring about
fine synthesis between change oriented
technologies and the country's continuity
of culture tradition as envisaged by the
National Policy on Education, 1986.
