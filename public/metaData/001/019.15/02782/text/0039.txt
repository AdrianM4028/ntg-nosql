the sun and to the glare of the people.
So is the folk theater.
The idea of a closed theater is
almost foreign to the Indian masses. In
the nineteenth century, when the British
introduced their educational system,
they also brought in the concept of the
picture frame stage. In big cities where
the amateur movement developed, a
few theater halls were built in midVictorian style with plush curtains gilded
chairs, and chandeliers. But in seven

hundred thousand villages of India the
traditional dance drama, pageants,
operatic ballads, and folk plays continue
to entertain audiences in the open air.
The folk play is performed in a
variety of arena stagings round,
parabolical, horizontal, square and
multiple-set stages, with different types
of gangways and " flower paths?" The
technique of arranging various scenes

at the same time and place in Ramlila

is very effective. The spectacle, by the
telescoping of time and space, speeds
the action of the drama. The naked
stage achieves spacelessness. The
Sutradhara, like a film editor, builds up

a montage of varied dramatic episodes.
The same spot is transformed into a
different place by a word or an action.
The folk actor uses very few props. He
creates places, rivers, forests, battle
scenes, and royal courts by the sorcery
of his art.
The most crystallized folk theater
forms are Jatra of Bengal Nautanki,
Ramila,

and

Raslila

of

North

India

Bhavai of Guirat Tamasha of
Maharashtra Therukoothu of Tamilnad
Yakshagana of Kanara and the Chhau
mask dramas of Seraikella. These forms
gives a glimpse of the richness of folk
theater and folk culture and the passion
of the people for life and drama.
