NOTE ON REAL | SM
Realism, like other movements in
western art, arose as a reaction against

the movement preciding it, which was
romanticism

and

has,

in

its

turn,

influenced the subsequent movements in
20th century theatre. This is so even
where there has been on ideological
difference in theory, for realism has left
an indelible mark on art and theatre
which is impossible to ignore.
Today we take realism and many of
it's aspects for granted but such was not
always the case. Factors such as society,
psychology, heredity, environment and
the ideologies of men like Freud, Marx
and Darwin were not always known or
accepted

amongst

society

or

even

amongst artists.
' Realism is usually defined as a
nineteenth century movement in which
the content of plays was concerned with
everyday life and it's social problems.
The actors were expected to reproduce
natural speech against scenery faithfully
representing recognizable surroundings
such as domestic interiors, in the telling
of a story within the bounds of
probability. The definition is important
for what it reiect viz, a declamatory
manner of speech, special scenic effects
and romantic melodrama.
Even a brief consideration of a few
events would shed light on the how and
why of realism. Without getting into
dates (for it is impossible to trace the
exact again or dissemination of an idea

or theory) it is relevent to know that this
was the time when Darwin came
forward with his theory of evolution and

a consumer society and the breakdown
of the feudal structure, There was also
the distinct formation तो working class
and their subsequent agitations to fight
for their rights. With Freud came the
idea of the unconscious mind with its
untold richness of meaning and
rnultilayered levels of understanding.
Zola, one of the pioneers for realism
expounded a philosphy which he called
naturalism, In terms of theatre, he
believed that the plot should not be an
invention, but an expression of the inner
lives of the characters and that the
logic of it's development should be the
logic, not of reason but of sensation
and emotion. The denouement should
not be a theatrical contrivance but the
mathematical solution to the proposed
problem. His belifs rested on the idea
that men and women are products of
heredity and environment (a continuing
theme with ibsen), that their actions are
directed by instinct rather than reason
and that they can be understood only
in items of the physiological and
psychological laws to which, like othe
animals they are subiect.
He further said that the playwright
must put on stage, not idealized
theatricalized abstractions, but flesh and
blood men and women taken from
relaity and scientifically analyzed. The
playwright must be a compiler of
human data, an anatomist of human
life. And ‘ since man is a social animal
the playwright must study society
syntifically as the chemist studies
substances and their transformations.
