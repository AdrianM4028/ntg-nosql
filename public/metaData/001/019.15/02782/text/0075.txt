Despite, however, these plus points
I can not help emphasising the dire
necessity of professionalism in theatre
in Jammu. It still lacks by and large
and without that it is sure to get stuck
up in the way. We are already seeing
that the theatre activity in Jammu is far
less hectic for some time past, than it
had been previously.
It is true that professionalism in
theatre in Jammu is easily said that
done when even in bigger cities this line
is not that paying as to induce talent
to take wholly to it. But it is also true
that if theatre movement has still to
forge ahead, there would be no
alternative to find some viable solution
to this seemingly intractable problem.
After all how long would youngsters go
on performing and also contributing
from their pockets to nurture theatre?
At the same time I do not hope any
worthwhile response from official
quarters. So all those interested in
theatre in Jammu must ioin their heads

together to ponder over the problem.
Better as soon as possible. Somewhere
initiative shall have to come.
I must also stress here that by and
large local theatre groups are ignoring
local touch in their performances. On
the national scene one observes that
overwhelming number of theatre
stalwarts had risen through the local
performances, both in language and
plays. Nearer home the Natrong group
which has got national recognition had
also reached there through its two plays
in Dogri language. It had performed
both these plays all over India with great
success.

In

times

modern

in

fact,

regional and local performances in all
walks of life are getting rewarded. It
would, therefore, be better if theatre
groups in Jammu also pay deep

attention to this fact. There is surely no
dearth of local material on which plays
in Dogri language can be written and
Dogri language is also rich enough for
that purpose. Only clue attention need
to be paid to that aspect of theatre here.
