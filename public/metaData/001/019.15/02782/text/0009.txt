My dear 513“;;,KJUXI
I am in receipt of your letter

under

N0. 4/41A dated 1.2.1997.
It was really exciting to know that
you have taken upon

yourself the onerous job

of organising a stage play on March 15th and
16th. You can avail of the following message
for the souvenir you are proposing to publish
on the occasion.
"To have a dedicated group of young
men interested in theatre and in enacting world
famous stage plays in our State is

to find that

life is still worth living. Such things, in fact,
constitute a message that notwithstanding growth
of cynicism in life we have some redeeming features
still

available around. I wish you success in your

endeavours."

You rs {
