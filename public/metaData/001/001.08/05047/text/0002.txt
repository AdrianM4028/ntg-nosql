The Play
Cast as an allegory. the play unfolds the pathetic condition of Manipur today. in the guise of a mystical land
comprising of nine concentric hill ranges encircling a

Nine Hills One Valley

valley. an erstwhile paradise, now plunged irt chaos,
with people running away from the clutches of the
demon Time. to fall to its wiles eventually. Seven Old
Women. protectors of the land. invoke the Seven Wise
Men. who awake from their slumber. decipher their
old prophecies. now fulfilled in all their horrorâ€”of

genocide. political instability. venality. unemployment
and extortion by lawless torces. They chart out a new
set of prophecies tor a better tuture. before leaving tor

their mysterious destination. viz. Hiyang Hiren. the
traditional Dragon Boat. The play closes with the
Mothers evoking the past. singing lullabies tor their
children. and pleading with the Wise Men to return.
Lamps are lit on the hilltops and all over the valley in
propitiation ol the Wise Men and praying for peace in
the valley.
