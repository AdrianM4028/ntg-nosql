Director’s Note
Born as a poem. it is a play without a conventional plot. It '
depicts what I see and what i feel about various systems
that lead a place and its people to a host of insoluble

problems. it is also a document of a restless society and
political turmoil where it is only the poor who suffer. Gone
are the days when the inhabitants of the valley and hills
loved one another and lived together as brothers. People
with vested interests have poisoned the minds of the people. Who is the ultimate sufferer? Common man, of
course. Ethnic clash. genocide. political instability. venal—

ity. unemployment. extortion by unlawful elements, mis—
se of power and money—the evils in our society
Jliance the woes of the common man.
How long can we remain content with our refined cultural traditions when danger is lurking everywhere?
