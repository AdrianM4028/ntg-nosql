the director speaks
.....

It is not enough to say "no",
Nor is it enough to feel angry.

A rebel is he who can dare who can, at some point of his
life, say, "I shall not".
And then his anger spills out —

in machine guns and his own blood.
Yesterday it happened.
'There was a man.
He had a dream.
And so he died.

It happened in Boliﬁia.

Blood spilled.

Tears of thousands of undertrodden were betrayed.

But still, we have our anger.
Yuuth — and dreams.
Che lives.
In all

0f

In me, you.

of us.
