”Man is the measure of life”.

This faith in the

.greatness ofrﬁan.asserts itself, ianQite of the squalor,
the dirt, the gloom and the grief, in the play.
To convey
this through the life of a motley gathering of the

”rejected ones” cﬁ‘society, is a real challenge.
why ”LOuHR D.FTES” is primarily an actors' play.

That is
Sets,

Costumes, lights etc. can only proﬁde the dark, dingy atmosphere.
It is for the living being on stage to emit rays
of brightness and Sparks of hope for the whole of oppressed
man kind in the face of these filthy surroundings and
cruel
life.
No wonder actors welcome such a challenge.

The play has no formal structure, no plcf er
story line as such. Things just happen and insist on your
attention. Things that you would not want to happen to uou,
happen to people whose shoes you would not want to be in. '
But such things happen and such people exist.
Gorky knew
it all. He knew it, fought against it and oversamegit with

millions of Kletschs, Satins, Pepels and Nastyas..
Life is merciless. so should its scrutiny by
theatre be.
You will really enter into the ”lower depths"
when you descend to our Basement Theatre.

IHere you have

neither the proscenium nor the theatre—in—the round. This
slice of life is before you, beside you and with you urging

you constantly to look, feel,think and judge.
