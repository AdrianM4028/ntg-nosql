DIRE‘TOR‘S NOTE:
.-

The'Present work at the National School of Drama on an
invitation to do a production with the actors here is my
sedond eXperience of working with a drama group. ﬁnlike
the previous work the present production is in Movement
and Mime almost without words supported by the music on

drums and voices. Belonging to the dance world, I naturall;
eXplored the possibility of movements in designing the play.
I believe that one could convey a lot through movements only
and many a times do not need words.

Since the whole nature of

doing this production is of a class-room experment, it has
to be judged as such.

For this production, I wished to take a down-to-earth
theme and chose to work on Maanaters which is also connected
with wild-life. The story of the play has been drawn by
me through the newspaper cuttings covering the neWs of Man
Eater Pujari of Dogadda, Pauri Garhwal and articles on wild
life. I also read observations of Jim Corbett about his
experience with the man eater at Rudraprayag. I deeply felt
that we in Indiaare destroying nature by cutting down the
forests and killing the wild animals. Profit motive is
behind all this and it is this deafmrestation which is one
of the main cause of compelling some wild animals to become
man eaters.

I started my work without any formal script, design or plot
and everything emerged out of every day's work. I asked
the actors to write their own dialogues and act them
in mime
anﬂ movement and not words. There are a few dialogues of
the
tiger which has been written by the actor himself. The
music

0“ drnmsg costumes, sets and liglt' ha“: been Hgyliaed

according to the productions. In all; it has been an
experience to work in a form which is experimental in the world
of theatre.
