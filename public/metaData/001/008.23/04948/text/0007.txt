Music : Dr'. SANGEETA GAUR
Direction : ARVIND GAUR

ABOUT TH E PLAY
Ek Marnooli Aadrni is a deceptively simple and entertaining play. At its core, however, it explores complex human
issues, from the topical to the eternal. At the level of narration, the play is about a head clerk, lshwar Chand Awasthi, in a
municipal office, who is about to retire. After leading a burdensome routine since his wife's death many years ago,
Awasthi comes to realise that he has virtually been dead all this time. The play traces how Awasthi slowly changes the
circumstances in and around him and in the process rediscovers life.
At another level, this play is about relationships - how we all seem to attach a great significance, even uniqueness to our
own life and achievements. In the process, the vitality of our life and that of the lives around us is drained out. Awasthi's
son Umesh, is no exception. He was no emotional response to his father ’5 death. In the absence of a relationship, even
his father’s death is a burdensome routine.
At the level of relationship the play underlines the need for giving space to compassion for others and how, in the
absence of such compassion , even religion or a way of life cuts into human being's secular and physical space.
The play draws its inspiration from the contemporary Indian society. It is the weaving of the memorable character of the
head- clerk in Akira Kurosawa’ s lkuru (Living), however that transforms the play into its present form.
