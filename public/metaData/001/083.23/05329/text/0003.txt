SPOTLIGHT . ॰ ०
— By Hari Vaidya

The opening show of ‘Dilli Ooncha Sunti Hai’ being planned, the Strategy set,

every small detail being jotted down; every now and then a piece of guideline, this
was the scene when I entered Mr. Bhatty’s place for a general chat. To my amazement.
the whole executive committee was present.

Looking at the entire team at work, a thought came to my mind, ‘In heaven an
angel is nobody in particul-ar.’ Bhatty, who was cmordinating the discussion, never let,
one, have a feeling of ones limitations.

He has never carried his weight around. When asked, ‘Why‘ pat came the answer,

“Titles disgrace the inferior, distinguish the mediocre and embarass the superior.
So dont embarass me with such a question.”

Being a man of military ideas, I asked him, “Whether you believe that this should
be imposed on a group, demarcating a clerk from a peon ? " Bhatty was equally
subtle "Equality is fundamental in every department of organisation” further
continuing he went on, "Our Strength lies in the dedication and hard work put in

by our members.”
Though knowing Bhatty since the day the group came into existence, I wanted to know how he managed to team up the spirit among diversified people. He
retort-ed poetically "we, are we not formed, as notes of music are ; for one another,

though dissimilar”. when asked about the future of Yavanika'l'heatres. he quipped
We believe in the present. Act now; for your future is based on your present
work.”
I had to accept, seeing them working; that here is a man who will lead Yava—
nika Theatres to a long way.
On my way out I could not resist asking Mr. Bhatty to write a message and
inform about the future plans. He only had to say “ At times, I prefer thought
to action, idea to event and reflection to activity but today let me execute the present.”
