A MESSAGE . . .
Friends,

I really

feel

proud in keeping

myself

attached

with

“YAVANIKA

'THEARES” consisting of young talent struggling
hard to make true art of theatre survive. You will be surprised, a

miniature group (4 years old baby) with giant manpower, and, infinite
capacity, can have no doubt about its future.

I assure you all, that we shall leave no stone unturned. to
reach the heights which we have visualised.

My sincere thanks to all the members of the organisation,
advertisers & donors who have helped us in making this evening
a grand success.

Expecting the same response in future from all of you,

With regards,

Prof. G. S. SOKHI
( Convener )
