I am happy to learn that a national workshop on
Womenâ€˜s Theatre is being held at Trichur by the
Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akaderni.
I hope, it will focus on women's contribution to contemporary Indian theatre and explore the possibilities of establishing a feminist theatre, which would
go a long way in ushering in an era, which will be
marked by a vibrant women's conciousness.
I extend my good wishes to the workshop which will
be attended by prominent theatre activists of various
states.
