Women are now looking at the world and themselves from a new

Theatre was always an ally of protest movements. It was an apt medium to express the anger, the hopes and the aspirations of the oppressed groups. Now a days there are several women theatre activists and directors in India. The purpose of the workshop is to provide
a meeting places of all of them to gather together. It is also hoped that

the workshop and the theatre festival would help us get a closer picture of the presence of women in the contemparary Indian theatre.
