K1101 Do
(361191१13 (:33
Kh011)0 is an interpretation in dance theatre of a
short story by Saadat Hasan Manto.
The story is set in the partition riots when millions
left their homes to cross the new border in search
ofa new home.
When Sirajuddin got off the special train at Lahore,
he was near unconscious. Where was his daughter,
_
Sakina? When had he got parted from her? He could
only remember the running crowd and Sakina's ' । ३ 1211. । .
Dupatta falling to the ground. When he turned to pick it up, she had urged, yelling in the melee,
"Don't bother with it." Sakina's mother was already dead. Her stomach had been ripped open.
"Leave me where I am, take the girl away”, were her last words.
In the refugee camp, the heavily armed eight young male volunteers had been so solicitous. "If
Sakina is alive we will find her for you ," they'd said reassuringly. Some days later, his heart leapt
for joy when he found his child. She wasn't dead, only unconscious. How was old Sirajuddin to
know his young daughter had been repeatedly assaulted by the same volunteers who had offered to find her for him?
Director's Note

In creating this piece I was strongly tugged by the idea that a father can become his daughter, so

deep is his anguish, and that he finds her in the movement of his body. He finds her in himself,
he finds her in dance.

A question for me was how to shift dance energy to a moment in a person's life when words are

not being used to signal the transition - after all it is these slips that make up the transition from
the father, Sirajuddin to the daughter, Sakina.

In great part I owe this piece to my awareness of Kathakali which I have practis
ed over several
years. Kathakali has a codiﬁed language of rnudras with speciﬁc meanings.
However, here I am
ooking for a physrcal language, where every action may set
off different signals of experience.
