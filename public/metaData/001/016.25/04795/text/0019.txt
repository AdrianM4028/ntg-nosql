Director's Note
Search for the right motifs to represent and recreate the life.
Why woman oriented themes take their cue from abroad while it is here women suffer more because of
their gender identity?
It IS rarely we find creative works from another continent to suit our context. But 'Medea' represents the

the presence and weight of a whole society.
