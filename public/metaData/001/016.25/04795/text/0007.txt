National Workshop on Women's Theatre proposed
to be conducted by Kerala Sangeetha Nataka
Akademi from 19th December to 29th December
1998 is a very novel and exciting venture. It is expected that the workshop will be a venue for practical and theoretical training as well as for a search
into how a womenâ€˜s theatre practice reflects their
problems both general and specific. I wish Kerala

Sangeetha Nataka Akademi and this programme all
success in giving our people an opportunity to see
and evaluate a cross-section of Indian women's theatre .
