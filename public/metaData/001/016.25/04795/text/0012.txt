Based on the life of Yasodhara, the wife of Prince

Sidhartha, who doesn't come to the centre stage in
the Buddha stories or in history.
Looking at the misery of the world, Prince Sidhartha,

Son of King Sudhodara, left the palace one night leaving his wife Yasodhara and his only son Rahula. The
prince later became enlightened sitting under a
Bodhi tree and became the Buddha. The play is an
attempt at portraying the Buddha story from the
perspective of Yasodhara.
Directors Note
Devasila/eal
(A dream : more real than reality)
This play is a discourse.
Truth is but only an illusion.
Though history is truth it does not speak out all of it.
This play dwells on the subconscious of history and human psyche.

Yashodara is the protagonist who doesn't come to the centre stage in the Buddha stories or in
history.
A silence endorsed by centuries.
This play is a search to listen to her voice and to see the face behind.
This play is designed be a critique of the history of the stage and at the sametime a vision for its
tomorrow.
" .... . Drama is like a dream
It is not real..... ..

But, really felt...
