“DAYASHANKAR Kl DIARY”
Dayashankar is alone. In his world. Fantasies and realities merge till the point
they become inseperable. Freud pointed out that a man lives as such inside his mind

as outside. But what happens to a man who cannot distinguish between the two?
"Dayashankar Ki Diary" is in the form of a dramatized memoir of an unsuccessful
man. A typical small town man who comes to the city with dreams of getting into films.
Instead he lands up on a clerical job and unable to reconcile with the drab realities of
his existence. Bertolt Brecht said" giving somebody a job for a small salary is same as
condemning him to life imprisonment" Dayashankar is overwhelmed with a sense of
rejection and humiliation. In his small dirty room which he shares with another man.
Dayahankar spins a fine cocoon of fantasies to shield himself from the reality. He spins
and spins this web in which he himself ultimately gets entangled and looses control.
Is Dayashankar really mad? why do we find ourselves relating to this character
? Do we also not live in our own fantasies to protect ourselves from our failures. And
what happens to a person who is not able to reconcile with those failures.
The play throws up such intriguing questions and most importantly provides an insight
into the fantastic happenings of the human mind.
