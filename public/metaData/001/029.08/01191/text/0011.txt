M ESSAG E

I am happy to learn that Delhi Public School, Mathura Road is staging
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's

Dream" to raise funds for the

construction of the Nursery Block. I am certain that the Hindi version of
this delighful comedy would be appreciated by audiences of all ages.

This light—hearted romantic fantasy is a beautiful blend of romance and
superstition.

I wish the Principal Mr. K. N . Sardana, the staff and the students success
in this venture.
