DIRECTOR'S NOTE

I feel privileged to be given an opportunity to present

Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', which is
a fantasy involving many facets of life.
As a Director, what attracted me to the play was the

conflict of love, pride and ego be it in the relationship
between Oberon and Titania; Theseus and Hippolyta or
even Helena — a theme of universal appeal. The play
very aptly depicts the pitiable predicament in which the
lovers are put.

The students have shown great enthusiasm, dedication
and discipline and have worked to the best of their

abilities.
I am extremely grateful for the whole-hearted cooperation of the Principal and the Staff of Delhi Public School,
Mathura Road.

I am also grateful to the Director, Mr2>Kirti Jain and
Associate Professor, Ms. Anuradha Kapoor NSD for the
'
confidence reposed in me.

I am obliged to Mr. Bansi Kaul, Mr. Sanjay Upadhyaya,

Mr. Rajesh Tiwari and Mr. J.N.Kaushal for extending
their help to make the play a success.
