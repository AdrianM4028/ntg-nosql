DPS Mathura Road, despite its age, continues to forge ahead with
youthful exuberance to conquer new heights. Fed on the goodwill of
people of Delhi, the school has grown in stature, which in turn has

enhanced its lustre, propelling it to a position of dominance on the
educational scene. Known for its irresistible appeal, there is always an
unending queue of young hopefuls looking for vacant seats in the School.

Since we work on a shoe-string budget, it is difficult to divert savings if
any, to building activity. A Private School is always dependent on the
rnunificence of its friends to keep it going. For many years we have tried
to build a Nursery School, but there has not been enough cash to realise

We are therefore staging William Shakespeare's play 'A
Midsummer Night's Dream' in Hindi which will not only amuse and
entertain but help us to finance the Nursery School project. The Director
and the cast have my very good wishes for sure sucess in this effort.

our dream.
