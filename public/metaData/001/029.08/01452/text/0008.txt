MRS . U. RAMAN

Since the school reopened inJanuary, there has been a
sense of urgency in the air. To plan, rehearse and mount a
full length play in three weeks seemed a daunting task. Mrs.

S. Chopra, our dynamic principal was a great source of
inspiration and support in this venture. With her active
encouragement we approached Rae’ll Padarnsee of
Bombay to direct and collaborate with us in the production of
Ali Baba and Baablu the Bear — a play very successful in
Bombay. Under her direction the teachers, students and
even many parents have been working very hard on
different aspects of the production. It has been a really
exhilarating and educating experience.
The response from everyone especially our parents has
been overwhelming.

Each person who has been

approached has responded readily, contributing time, talent,
energy or material to the project. Many others have
responded generously to our appeal for advertisements. The
advantage and benefits of such a project can best be seen
in the children. They shine with a sense of purpose and
excitement that comes from involvement in something truly
creative. Even those at the fringes of the production have
been stimulated and excited by all that is happening around
them.

For us it has been a valuable learning experience. We hope
it will be an enchanting viewing experience for our audience.
