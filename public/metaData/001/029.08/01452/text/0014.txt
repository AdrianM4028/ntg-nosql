enthusiastically take part in these activities.

Skating has been introduced for the first time
and is one of the most popular activities we
have. Each and every child wants to move
about on wheels. All the sport orientated
activities are also very popular especially

among the boys. Clay modelling is liked by
many children. They love moulding the clay into
various shapes with their Own hands or on the
potter's wheel. For the Electronics activity
children of Classes V and Vi are only eligible.
They love to work wth tools and wires. Their
faces warm up with an air of achievement as
they ae able to make switch boards, voltage
stabilizers and LED blinkers. On every Friday
we get some deliciOus and tasty snacks
prepared by our Cookery children.
All the above activities are very popular. Each
child wants to participate in all the activities at
the same time, which is not possible. So every
year they take up a different activity.
This weekly hour of fun and creativity gives
every child an opportunity to develop his/her
talents and personality.
