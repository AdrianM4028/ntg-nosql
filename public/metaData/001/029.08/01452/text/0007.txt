M E S S A G E
Our Junior School at East of Kialsh, under the able
MRS. S. CHONA

stewardship of Mrs. Urna Raman, is a school that has
developed on the pillars of initiative and challenge, and I am
proud to say that it stands today as a constructive and
effective learning medium, with professional standards and
comprehensive expertise.
However, a school is not merely a place of formal learning,
or a place where children are programmed to compete, to
memorize to pass exams. Education, as I see it, includes
everything that exerts a formative influence on the child and
the yeas spent by a child in a primary school are the most
impressionable years in the process of his/her growing up. It
is thus my endeavour to inculcate in the school new
methods of communication between the teacher and the
child, which is the key to opening a student's mind to
learning.
Theatre can be viewed as one such key. Our attempt at DPS
Fl.K. Purarn and its Junior Schools is to create plays
compatible with the interests, psychology and language of
the children of our school, plays directly related to subjects
in the school curriculum. For what and how children learn,
are all inter-related. And I do hope this school production 'Ali
Baba and Bablu the Bear’ provides a unique and valuable
service to our students in their pursuit of knowledge and
development.
I am reminded of the wise words of the great sage Swami
