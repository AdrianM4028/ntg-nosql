I am glad to know that DPS East of Kailash is having its
R. S . LUGAN I

Annual Day. Thanks to the hard work put in by the
Headmistress and Staff of the School in maintaining high
tradition of academic excellence and all-round development
of the personality of the child.

The daily chores, the speed and efficiency with which the
School works provide hope to many children. Let us all work
together to make ours and other lives more meaningful and
bea ut ifu | .
I wish the function a great success.
