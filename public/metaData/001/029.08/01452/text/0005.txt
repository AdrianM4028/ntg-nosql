M E S S A G E
I am glad to learn that the Delhi Public School, East of
A. N. GROVE R

Kailash is celebrating its annual day function on 30th
January, 1993. I wish and hope that the school will bring out

in the Annual Day Souvenir the salient features of their

activities as well as contributions of the staff and the tiny

tots, The little kids must also be encouraged to contribute in
this Souvenir by way of sketches, poems, short stories or in
any other form.

I wish the Annual Day Celebrations all success.
