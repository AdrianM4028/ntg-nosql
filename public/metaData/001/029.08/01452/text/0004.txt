The ' Schools of the Delhi Public School Society are wellP RE M KI RPAL

staffed at adequately prepared for enriching the School

environment. The Junior School at East of Kailash is already
a model ‘of educational activity at its foundations. With
encouragement and cooperation from the Home and the
Society, the School is well-poised from Excellence and
Creativity.

The foundation of New Education is laid in a new
environment of Joy, Freedom and Security at the junior
school where the Teacher is a guide, mentor and mother for
rearing children to grow and take charge of their lives in the
emerging world of great challenges and opportunities.
Right Education and authentic culture from historic roots and
unfolding vision are needs of nations and Mankind entering

now a planetary order to protect Mother Earth and help each
other for Happiness and Peace of Mind. To purge the
Psyche of lust and greed, illuminate the Mind and Heart with

growing knowledge and light of Wisdom, to give one’s self to
other selves for merging in Great Pervasive Self - Such are
the Tasks for education! To culture as a Source of learning
and making of the human person for Harmony and
Luminosity we should direct new Education by exploring and

nurturing our roots while growing taller trees and forests.

Quietness of Spirit and Creativity, Quest of Beauty and of
Truth, song and Joy of Togetherness, sweet courtesy and

chivalry, are resplendent jewels of abiding culture to blend
with new Education.
I am glad to send my greetings and best wishes to Principal
Shyarna Chona, the Headmistress Uma Raman and the staff

and students at this auspicious occasion. May the seeds of
new Education sprout and blossom in the School’s happy
Environ ment.
