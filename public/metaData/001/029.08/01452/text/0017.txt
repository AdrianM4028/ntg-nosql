The wrong copier paper can shorten the life of
any photocopier. And that can lead to delays in
your ofﬁce.

We don’t think you should have to worry about
copies when you need them. So we make
Sunshine Copier Paper specially for plain paper
copiers.

To ensure that our paper works with your
copier’s paper path instead of against it, we build
just the right amount of moisture into every sheet.
We test each sheet for stiffness, weight, thickness,
brightness 8: ﬂuorescence, opacity 8: smoothness,
curl & colour, toner acceptance, imaging quality,
and much more.

All so you can get clear, crisp copies, to last
longer, look better, time after time.

Sunshine Copier Paper is a quality product from
BILT,
Ballarpur

the
manufacturers of India’s finest, India’s wides
