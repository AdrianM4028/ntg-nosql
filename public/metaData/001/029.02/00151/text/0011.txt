FARMAI SHI OVE RC OAT
Love is a luxury which very poor people can afford,
and THE
BESPOKE OVERCOA'I‘ is a story of this love. It
is not a love which
conquers all.
FENDER does not get enough food or
a tailor-made
overcoat, in this life. In life he does not ﬁnd satisf
action, except in so far

as he is- able to accept with humour and humility the depriv
ations forced
upon him. It is because this humour and humility is shared
with his friend
that FENDER, in spite of everything, Would prefer
to go on living.

To

prefer to go on living is to love in the context of this story,
and because
this is loving at its most deprived the story is a sad one.
