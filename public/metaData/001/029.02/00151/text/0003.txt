Quality is the essential raw material without which the CBC product wouldn’t
exist. That’s because the manufacturing speciﬁcations are narrowed down to
the most rigid, although the range is wide enough so that almost all your

electrical requirements and components are available at one source. It also
means you save time, effort and cost when you rely on GEC.
