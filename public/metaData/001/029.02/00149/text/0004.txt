right or wrong I am not to answer this question.
generally condemn the Punjabi drama ?

The question is why do they

There are certainly plays of standard

in Punjabi language though theatrically Punjab is said to lstill a barren land'.

EK CHADAR MAILI SI—is a classic novel of Rajinder Singh Bedi

and many have tried to dramatise it and according to Bedi Ji, ‘have made a mess
of it’. This Work of Rajinder Singh Bedi has acclaimed in the country and abroad
wide appreciation for him.
pleasure to say that

I too have dramatised it in my own way and I feel

it is an adorned drama of my Association.

I congratulate

and express my gratitude to Delhi Natya Sangh for allowing my Association to
stage this play under their patronage.

My play ——lK CHADDER MAILI—does not reﬂect current taste and

make you sit through a mere collection of sexual jokes.

Its a piece of art in

Punjabi language and after witnessing the same you may feel yourself a character

within yourself.

My artists in the play have made it so real and complete that

they leave a deep imprint on your mind.
