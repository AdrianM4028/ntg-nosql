To talk about the drama before staging it is as delicate and vulnerable as the ﬁrst
meeting of lovers —when every action and word of your’s has to be carefully measured, lest
all your castles crumble! But still, I just don’t know why I feel like talking to you...

On our march through the passages of the old theatre, we have reached a height
which is very near to the stage, television & the ﬁlms. But every media has its own knack
of expressions. The stage has numerous limitations. A whole life has to be rolled out for

you in just two hours — in a manner that overwhelms you, enthraljs you;

But isn’t drama just a way of life ? From, dawn to dusk We keep meeting people,
talking to them—to some heartily to others ‘matt‘eriOf-f'actly’ and to '7 most of them just a
casual, feign hello ! Is this all not acting ? And is this all not blatantly sham ? The only
difference, perhaps, is that on stage we present a

well planned, properly groomed pretence,

coated with crispy dialogues, scintillating music and enchanting surroundings.

Such is the

refulgence of the character that sometimes, we loose our own identity; we get lost in the
role and start the unreal for real.

Whatever be

the theme,

the purpose is to bring you to a world far different and

fascinating than the routine, 'humdrum one—a world in which your heart beats‘ 111 rythm
with the pulses of the characters. This, is essence, is the success of the drama. Eet’s see
how far it goes... !
