nun CHILDREN
SHOULD lNHERIT ~
A BETTER wonLn
Family planning in Our country is an
essential part of our whole strategy of
enlarging welfare. Greater Welfare is,
in fact, the only reason for Family
Planning. And we need it not because
wa are against more children but
because we want every child to have
the best opportunity possible in life.

We want our children to inherit a better
world than our own. This is the aim
of every father and mother, and this is

the objective of planned development.
