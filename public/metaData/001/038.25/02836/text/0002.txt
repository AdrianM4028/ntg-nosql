An evening of two short plays by Dario F0 and Franca Rame

The first piece A WOMAN ALONE captures the hysterically funny and tragic
situation of today's woman; prisoner of her husband, sex object, exploited
worker and housewife.
”Exuberance, ribald, expansive, piquant....Mona ’s virtouso performance held
one in complete thrall with a palpable release of tension as the lights finally
faded. Bears repeated viewing, should not be missed. ”

— The Hindustan Times;

”HOW THIS WOMAN ACTS l A pleasure to see Mona Chaw/a ’s remarkable
energy and gusto. . . . She succeeds admirably in capturing the essential F0 style“
— The Sunday Observer

'MAMA'S VOICE' is a brilliant hard hitting look at the mother of a terrorist
who learns of her son's arrest through the TV news! In their inimitable style
that combines comedy with tragedy and draws on the Italian tradition of the

Commedia del'Arte, the authors satirize middle class assumptions, myths of
parenthood, the political system, questions relating to drug addiction .....

"Mona Chawla as the Italian mother is quixotic, emotional, temperamental
and manages to elicit much sympathy from her audience, her continuous
query, ’wha t shall / do ’ .9 is fraught with maternal tragedy and the audience is

unequivocally involved in her drama ”

— The Hindu
