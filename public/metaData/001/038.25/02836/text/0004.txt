A dramatization of Vijay Dan Detha's 'Kenchuli'
Odhn i, a metaphor defining the limits of a woman's existence. A piece of
cloth really beautiful, soft, encompassing, comforting. But as it enshrouds
the face of Laachhi, the newly married Gujjar woman in Odh n i, it blocks,
curtails, limits all desires and aspirations. An unguarded moment of ease,

a glance outward, beyond the limits imposed, and the cloak is rudely

pulled forward, blocking from view all that lies beyond this invisible
boundaries.
Boundaries. Who defines them? What does it take to go beyond them, to

subvert them? Such questions arise as one watches Odhni. Stretching the
edges of these boundaries, with her laughter, scorn, and later anger, is

Laachhi .......
”Feisal Alkazi's Odhni is an intimate production that uses the theatrical
device of the Chorus and frequent shifts of narration to bring alive the
oppression of Laachhi’s c/oistered existence. Smita Vats as Laachhi and
Ashish Roy as the sly Bhoja give impressive performances. "
— The Economic Times
”An engrossing, moving experienc‘e that will not be easily forgotten. A

production that must be repeated time and again."
