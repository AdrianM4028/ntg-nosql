We are proud that India Habitat Centre has invited us to i naugarate
this theatre with RISHTE NAATE. In a similar fashion we were
the first to perform at what is now called the Sriram Centre
Basement Hall 20 years ago. Our production there was Camus’

The Just Assassins. We would especially like to thank Mehreen
Khosla and Renuka Khanderkar for their help with filling us in
on the background of this play. Also thanks to Mr. & Mrs. Subodh
Aggarwal for helping with the props.
The play has two acts. Act-l is 1 hour 15 minutes long and is
followed by a 10 minute interval Act-II is 40 minutes long.
