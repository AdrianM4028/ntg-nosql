JAYWANT DALVI
Jaywant Dalvi needs no introduction to the discerning theatre
goer. His famous play ’Sandhya Chaya’ received an
outstanding production by the National School of Drama
Repertory Company. This production with Manohar Singh
and Surekha Sikri, directed by Uttara Baokar was performed
for over three years in the 80’s. Jaywant’s other well known
play is ’Barrister’, better known in its’ film version ’Rao

Sahib’ directed by Vijaya Mehta, with Anuparn Kher and
Tanvi Azmi. Robin Dharmaraja’s film ’Chakra’ with Smita
Patil and Naseeruddin Shah was based on Jaywant’s novel
of the same name. The television serial ’Hasratein’ currently
being telecast is based on a novel by Jaywant.
Jaywant’s writing is known for his choice of unusual subject

matter and his unerring theatrical craft. While ’Sandhya
Chaya’ dealt with the loneliness of old age, ’Barrister’

examines the clash of traditional and modern values, and

’Chakra’ sensitively portrays life in a Bombay slum. He has
created some of the most memorable characters on stage in
l nd ia.
