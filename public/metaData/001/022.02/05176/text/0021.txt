first training programme, which had been
preceded by a preliminary programme in

The National Puppet
Theatre

February 1984, produced a repertoire of
The second training programme in
puppets conducted by Genevieve and
Francis Vedrenne, French puppeteers,
took place from 26.2.89 to 19.3.89 in the
premises of the French Cultural Centre,
Antananarivo. During this second training
programme, the trainees had to
undertake, especially, a theoretical
approach to string puppets: study of
characters, Study of construction,
morphological study, layout of the strings,
etc. Generally, the Malagasy puppeteers
have not yet mastered this form of
manipulation. On the other hand, in
manipulation of glove and stick puppets,
they are very skilful.
The trainees divide themselves into
three groups, and each group creates
itself the characters, dramatic script,
staging,scenography and possibly the
sound effects. Thus, three forms of games
were conducted during the training:
lst game: Pure manipulation with very
little text, with music being the dominant

element (recorded music). This group
worked on an ecological theme.
2nd game: Pure manipulation, very
little text for the characters and the
puppeteers, the text is introduced as
playback This group worked on a
phenomenon of the galaxy, which
resulted in a visual spectacle in miracle,

fantasy and even anticipation.
3rd game: Manipulation with glove and
thread, very few characters. Very useful
text, since this group worked on a
militant theme with a satirical character, it
dealt with the phenomenon of
corruption. It is a small, poetic and
militant theatre, a little like the
atmosphere created by Bertolt Brecht in
some of his plays, for example, Great
Fear and Misery of the llIrd Reich.
All the puppets of the Puppet Theatre
of the Ministry of Revolutionary Culture
and Art were used in the training
prOgramme. They were generally up to
the mark This generated the admiration
of the experts, especially for the
craftsmanship. They were surprised and
fascinated by some of the techniques
used by the technicians of the Ministry,
techniques that they had never seen

before. Taking into account the time
taken by the scenography and
for
scriptwriting, not much place was left
ing '
staging. In future, it was felt, a train
for

style is lively, attractive and full of action.
The Mali technique involves traditional
(stem) puppets and masks and is

accompanied by bells. The language used
by the main puppeteers in the songs
and the dialogue to accompany the
shows is Bamanan Kal. The group
consists of 11 members, and the director

and writer as well as leader of the puppet
group is Yaya Coulibaly.
