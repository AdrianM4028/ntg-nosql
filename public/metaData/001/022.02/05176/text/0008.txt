theatre through school productions and,
in the summers, played in the pit
orchestra for professional productions.
Meanwhile, Muriel pursued her career as

a primary school specialist, staying home
for only a few years after their two
children, Carol and Gregory, were born.

During the 19605, David and Muriel
spent their summers teaching at the
Manitou—W’abing Camp of Fine Arts, one
of the ﬁrst ﬁne arts camps in Canada. As a
result of this experience, David became
interested in high schools for the arts. For

his master’s degree at the University of
Toronto, he wrote his thesis, ‘A Proposal
for a High School of Music for

Metropolitan Toronto.’ His idea was
mead of its times: today there are well
over a dozen such institutions in Ontario.
As their children grew, David and

Muriel became involved in puppetry
again, putting on shows for their
children’s birthday parties. In 1965, they
put on their ﬁrst major puppet play,
