urgent themes like national integration,

SURESH DUTT’A
Sita
Exiled from Ayodhya after Rama’s

triumph in Ianka, Sita unknown to the
world gives birth to her twin sons lava

and Kusha in Valmiki’s forest hermitage.
Together with the scriptures, the boys
learn weaponry and grow up brave and
strong. They challenge the progress of the
Ashwamedha horse and the soldiers sent
out by Rama to establish his supremacy
over other kings. lava-Kusha’s victory in
the battle that follows reveals their
identity as Rama’s sons and the two are
recalled to Ayodhya along with their
mother.

But Sita, unable to bear the shame of
her exile, passes away into the earth
whence she came. Saddened but
undismayed, lava and Kusha vow to serve
the land that gave her birth.
