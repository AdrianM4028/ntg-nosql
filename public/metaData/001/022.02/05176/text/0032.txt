VIETNAM
Water Puppet Theatre of
Hanoi
Water puppets are a branch of
Vietnamese theatrical art. It has existed

for a long time and been related with the
water-rice civilization of the Vietnamese
nation. It has proved that the inhabitants
have not only conquered water to create
material wealth for their lives but also
used their intelligence and creativity to
fashion a unique medium of
entertainment.
The Vietnamese water puppet art was
born in and related to the life of the
villages, round the ponds and lakes
behind the bamboos. All the people’s
dreams and fears about production,
hunting, life are reﬂected in it.
Until the 12th century, the cultural
monument Sung Tham Dien Liu on Long
Doi mountain (Ha Nam Nirh province)
recorded a performance of water puppets
there for King Ly Than Tong in 1121.
The stage for water puppets is the
Imperial Water Palace. In the centre of a
pond or lake, the performing ﬂoor is the
shining water in front of the palace.
The audience stands or sits around on
the bank of the lake to watch it. The
actors have to keep themselves in the
water behind a thin curtain and conduct
the puppets. All the tools and sticks for
conducting the puppets are covered by
the lake water, thus adding to the
miraculous effect of puppets moving over
the .water apparently unaided.
That is why the water puppet art has
created a lot of expectations and
enjoyment in the audience. The beauty of
this art is increased when it has imbibed
the essence of the traditional sculpture art

and of red lacquer and gilt painting of
Vietnam. The puppets are thus made
more beautiful and the ancient statues fOr

worshipping become more beautiful and
brilliant in addition to the beauty of the
lakes.
The strong point of water puppets is
that they have exploited all the technical
factors of conducting the puppets in the
available water with simple tools to make
unexpected effects in simple items like
‘Rearing Ducks and Catching Foxes‘,
‘Fishing’, ‘Frog Catching’, ‘Night Fairies’,
‘Unicoms Playing with Ball’.

The topics that water puppets refer to
are also simple and near to the lives of
the people, which are circumscribed by
the village bamboos.
As it bears in itself a ‘purely national

art’, ‘a national colouring art’, newspapers
and world opinion have extolled the
