INDIA
The Darpana Puppet

Troupe of Meher

With the revival of UNIMA (Union
Internationale de la Marionetta) after the

UNIMA This organization has inspired
me to work for it and though I was
essentially trained in Iondon to become a
portrait painter I gave it up for puppetry,
it so fascinated me, and besides I found it
a wonderful medium to introduce in our
education and mass communication.
With the constant encouragement and
backing of the late Kamaladevi
Chhattopadhyay, Mrinalini Sarabhai and
Leena Mangaldas, the Darpana Academy
offered me all the scope to teach and
experiment. This facilitated some worthy
productions like the Ramayana in
Andhra shadows, Savitri’Satyavan in

small paper shadow and Rustom Sobrab
in large coloured shadows. I have done
and carved wooden rod puppets for the

children.
Audiences who have seen the new
puppet performances in the country are
gradually waking up to the fact that the
puppet theatre is a wonderful form of
entertainment for young and old. Visiting
foreign troupe have helped to partially
dispel their bias.

puppets, has inﬂuenced many upcoming
theatres in Bengal where he runs training
camps. And Sanjit Ghosh, with his

internationally famous Vir Pumsb and the
TV serial Alladz'n and his Wonderful
Lamp, is very promising.

Then there is Dadi Pudumjee who was
with us in Darpana. He has won several
scholarships and is, I am proud to say,
one of the very creative young puppet
players with his productions of Dbola
Mara, Mottu Ki Moocbh and many short

stories. He was invited to Berlin to
produce a shadow and live actor play on
a Rajasthani folk tale. Presently he is part
of Astad Deboo‘s modern dance group,
with a puppet for a dancer.
Another student of mine, Bela

do three plays fOr the Festival of India in
Moscow. Bela designed the sets and Dadi
did the puppets. They performed in the

an animation ﬁlm at the National Institute
of Design, based on a German folk tale.
She also does a lot of free- lance work for

Kamavari. Many plays on environment

and social problems and Panchatantra

But teaching was my proper profession
and today I am proud to have hepled
many young puppeteers to go abroad and
study, won them scholarships and most
of them are now doing genuinely creative
work in puppetry.
Outstanding among contemporary
puppeteers are two versatile young men
from Calcutta. Suresh Dutta of the

In Maharashtra there is Meena Naik who
has done a lot on Bombay Doordarshan.
In Bombay also there was the old and …
venerable puppet master Madhulal Master
who had been really the ﬁrst to make
modern puppets but was cruelly
murdered last month in his house. Then
there are the Srinivasans in Hyderabad,

Srivastav in Lucknow and many others all
over the country.
Rustom Sohrab
The ancient Andhra shadow puppets
made of leather, the largest coloured

shadow puppets in the world, were the
inspiration behind the production of
Rustom Sobr'ab. Their size made sets
redundant. Environment is purely
suggestive. While sets or locales are
created by a pillar, a couple of trees, a
bird, a tray of food, a puddle of water,

etc., allowing the puppets greater

freedom of movement, the performing
screen which is 15' long and 6V2’ wide is
often used as a complete whole for an
event like war, besides being used as the
earth and sky when necessary, but

without any dividing line. location is
established by the movement of the
puppets at different levels.
The puppets are not as ﬂexible as the

Andhra shadows, though Rudabeh is
designed on the pattern of Sita who is the

dancing puppet of Andhra. The dancers
in the wedding scene are made mobile
for the same purpose.
