Nanchong Puppet Troupe The Naive Th

of Sichuan
The Sichuan troupe uses Yiling grand
puppets or North Sichuan grand puppets.
This traditional puppet style is already
300 years old. The grand puppet is a life—
size rod puppet. The facial features can
be manipulated. At times it performs
along with human actors using masks
which can even confuse the audiences
between the puppets and the live actors.
The grand puppets perform operas,
dances and acrobatics. For this feStival the
Sichuan province brings the following
plays :

The leader of the group is Huang Deji.
The stories are based on folklore and the
music is based on traditional Chinese
music.

The widest and most varied sphere of

artistic activity is devoted to plays for
children of the lower and medium school

of Germany, Switzerland, West Berlin and
Mexico.

The Naive Theatre’s creations are
intended mostly for children and
teenagers. The particularity of the
proceedings of this theatre is the creative
character which leads to handling the
dramatic text from a certain distance and
more freely. Furthermore, it is its
endeavour to take full advantage of the
musical and scenic components of the
artistic work and, last but not least,

proﬁting by the speciﬁc synthesising

power of the puppet show (object—
man), which enables it to reach unity of

expression, language and style.
The Naive Theatre has 64 employees,
25 of them belonging to artistic workers:
one dramaturgist, two stage managers,
two stage designers, two accompanistscumchoir conductors and sixteen actors.

During one season it stages four to six
premieres, addressing different audiences
of different younger generation audiences

of different ages.
The performances for the younger
generation — Materinky (i.e.
kindergarten plays) — are a tradition at
the Naive I heatre. This stage form proved
very successful and was given regular care
also in many other Czechoslovak theatres.
I hese plays require only a small cast

and a not too large mobile scenery,
which at the Naive Theatre is usually
based on the stage designer’s wits. As to
their dramaturgy, these plays are inspired
by various sources such as nursery

age ranges The stage managers proﬁt

from the musical and histrionic abilities
of their cast so that the repertoire of plays
for this age category involves puppet
musical, puppet opera and lots of
dramatical works where the musical
component is given predominance. The
centre of gravity of the creations however
— besides that of dramatized versions of
both the classical and modern fairy tales

— lies nevertheless in the Sphere of plays
written expressly for the puppet theatre.
The last decades of the Naive Theatre
may be called a period of great inventive

explorations undertaken in the realm of
creations intended for teenagers and
young adult audiences. Apart from the

comic genre, clear tendencies appear to
face this spectator from another point of
view —— at the level of a more serious
topic. let us state that in all the spheres
mentioned above the Naive Theatre has
achieved success and valuable
appreciation. Four ﬁrst Materinka prizes
(Materinka is the national review of

performances of the Czech professional
puppet theatres for pre-school children)
for staging the play Motanz'ce (Medley) in
the year 1974, The Button-Locked Gate

(1979), The Tall, the Thick and the
Shatpsz'ghted (1983), Brumhmm
Tululum (1985), and four Skupa Prizes
from the Skupa’s Plazen Festival (this

festival being the competition-review of
the Czech professional theatres for
puppet shows for children from 6 to 15
years of age) for staging Ruhezahl Forest

(1975), Devil, Kate and the Little Lambs
(1980), Turandot the Cruel (1982) and

the fairy tale about Jack and Kate (1984)For its long-lasting and determined
artistic activities the Naive Theatre was
awarded the Prize of the Ministry of

Education in 1983 and conferred the State
distinction for eminent work in 1986.
