conﬂict with his wife Bichekhon. But the
traditional puppet quarrel will not
interfere with merriment.

The story of a poor peasant, who saved
the magic stork in the fairy tale ‘Cudgel!
beat!’ will also have a happy ending. With
the help of the stork the poor peasants
managed ﬁnally to get rid of all the
greedy and malicious rulers who robbed
the people.
The play performed by two actors, is a
ﬁne opportunity to get acquainted with
different types of the traditional Uzbek
puppet plays, among them shadow
theatre, rnarionettes which perform an

Uzbek dance, glove puppets, which will
perform the sketches ‘Selling the Donkey‘
and ‘Roosters’ Fight’, and also big
puppets, with which one puppeteer
performs the national style wrestling
called ‘kurash’ .
Besides, the spectators will have a
chance to get acquainted with Uzbek
music, dances and songs, musical

instruments and folk melodies with
verses from classical Oriental poets Omar
Khayyam and Alisher Navoi.
