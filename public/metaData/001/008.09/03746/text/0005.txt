India illustrates the aesthetic values and inclination for truth and

eternal beauty in that society.
Rishi Ashtavakra is the central character of the play. He was
grandson of Aaruni-Uddalak, known for his devotion to his Guru.
While he was still unborn, in the womb of his mother Sujata,
Ashtavakra pointed out the mistake ofhis father Kahod Muni teaching his pupils in Gurukul. Indigant Kahod Muni threw a curse on
his own unborn son. Hence, Ashtavakra became ugly and orthopedically deformed at eight spots of body.
Kahod Muni was defeated by a clever (scholar) ‘Pandit Bandi ’
of King Janak’s court, in a scholarly-debate. His wife Sujata, her
father Rishi Aaruni Uddalak, and all the pupils of the Gurukul became very sad at the unexpected happening and insulting death

sentence inﬂicted on Kahod Muni.
Ashtavakra comes to know about it in his twelfth year. Raged
at his father’s insult, Ashtavakra decides to go to Mithila with his
teenage maternal uncle Shewta-Ketu, to give a lesson to Pandit _

Bandi.
After being laughed at the physical deformity, and scorned for
being Kahod Muni’s son, Ashtavakra scolds the scholars of the
royal court and calls them _‘ skin traders ’ .Every body is stunned by
his sharp arguments.
Did Ashtavakra prevail over the clever and proud Pandit Bandi
? Could Ashtavakra reestablish the lost honour and glory of many
rishi-scholars like his father, or not ?
The story proceeds with touching and interesting events.
