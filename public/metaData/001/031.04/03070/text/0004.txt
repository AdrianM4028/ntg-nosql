Kya

Beta"

is a (torn-drama

inspired by the personality and poetry of erza Asad-ullah
Khan Ghalib. t he grand old man of Urdu Poetry. The whole
play is an attempt to visualise and 'present the 19th-century

lite and works of Mirza Ghalib.

Though

the drama begins with ‘the adulthood oi

Mirza Ghalib yet it gradually unfolds the other layers of his
' lite. Ghalib himself makes autobiographical remarks which
spontaneously. make the audience learn about the life of
his past. Depiction of the vicissitudes of Ghalib's life through
scenes and poety makes it easier for the audience to have
a look at the life of the legend. Inclusion of Ghalib's
contemporary poets in a Mushaira takes the audience face
to {are with t he renowned Urdu poets of 19th century such
as Zauq.. Momin Khan Momin, Aatish. Nasikh and Zafar.

A scene depicting the contempts Ghalib hurled on
the revolutionaries of 1857. Unfolds a somewhat negative
. gimmmrh adopted by the poet-vis-a-vis the Mutiny. This
ztsnt‘t‘t ot' Ghalib's life has so tar been avoided by the writers
to saw (lhztlih's admirers from cnibarasement. The play
ends on the l‘xlaxaur of Glialil) with' the following couple! '
"Hui muddat ke ghalib mar gaya per yaad aata hai
