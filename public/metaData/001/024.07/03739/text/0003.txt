Based on a real life incident when 'an anarchist' accused of spreading
terror, accidentally 'fell' from a fourth storey window while being interrogated by the police. The play takes itself up after the incident. The main
character, the Maniac, uses his madness to uncover not only the circumstances of the death of the 'anarchistâ€˜ but also attempts by the authorities
to cover up the incident Being a 'nut case', he not only changes his
persona to fool the police but also forces them to implicate themselves.

The play belongs to that period in European history when student fascination for workers' movement was on the rise. With 'state massacre' for
its theme, Dario Fo launches a scathing criticism of the politico-legal
system of the bourgeois state where its own constituted organs blatantly
organise lies.

The Play is a farce that uses the category of madness to invert notions of
the normal. It also reveals the uses of the abnormal in subverting author-

ity by not playing by rules enforced by the established order. Fo has

used humour as a surgeon's scalpel, to tear away the layers of hypocriti-

cal and self-serving guile from the body politic. Thus, he pitches the two
potent forces of laughter and madness against the state and its tool the

police. He reveals his deep sympathy with the masses that are victims

of the system, preferably not just silent victims. As the maniac reveals,
victims could have a powerful and an intelligent voice too.
