'TRAGOlDlA' is a Greek word meaning ‘goat song'. It may be referred to
one fact that a goat was the prize given

to the winning tragic poet in the competitions of plays frequently organised.
The term ‘tragedy' finds its origin in
this Greek word 'Traigoidia'.
The plays before Aeschylus were a
simple narrative recitation by one chorus consisting of both men 8 women.
He introduced the firsr actor ‘Thespis'
and made some dialogue possible. The
importance of chorus was further under-

mined when new characters were added
which heigtened the dramatic conflict
by way of increased complexity of plot
and action.

Ar'stotle who gave the first authentic
definition of tragedy based his analysis
largely on the works of one Greek play

wrights Aeschylus, Euripidies Er Sopho—
cles. According to him tragedy portrayed man at his highest and most coura-

geous even as he is being pursued by a
relentless and tragic desting.

It provi-

des a valuable insight into human condition and act as a safety valve for the
release of man's otherwise harmful and
dangereous emotions.

It this sense, classical tragidies for
all their evocations of pity and fear present an optimistic view of man, who is
ennobled by fate even as he is being
destroyed by it. The Greek characters
possess the ability in the from of free
will, to work out their own destiny in
the face of devine will .
