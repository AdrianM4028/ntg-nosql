How many times have many of us wondered- 'what are we?',
Mha t controls us?', how many times do we question our actions and
the motivations which may or may not be ours, which make us perform
these actions?
THE‘ DO-IT-YOURSELF FRANKFJNSTEIN OUTFIT revolves
around' these very questions.
The dividing line between a mask and
a face, an actor and a character, or a man and a machine, is often

indistinct, increasingly so in fact for us — who live in the
machine age, where our very individual identities are swamped by
greater forces of money or power.
If by the end of the play you
feel a certain amount of unease as regards your identity, the play
will have proved to have had its impact.
This play was a rather difficult choice, as we found during
the process of rehearsal.
The limited number of characters was
compensated in the script by the sheer intensity of the lines
themselves.
The achievement of this high degree of intensity in
the performance necessitated a tremendous a cunt of involvement

by members of the cast.

We hope that this communicates itself to

you - sitting there and watching this play.
