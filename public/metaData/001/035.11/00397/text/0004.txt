We live in a wondrous world

With a right to be
What we want to be

—‘ Kid stu f'

Questions hang suspended
remain unasked and unanswered.

Silence lies unbroken

३

feelings felt never spoken.
We live out our lives
In separate worlds.
Who knows till when.
——‘Sixteen Stuck’

So burn out the beautiful hopes in your head

Put them away, let them die
And when all your tomorrows just go up in flame
Then look away and sigh
Forget all the picturers of pain that you see
Yours in not to reason why
So burn out the beautiful hopes in your head

Reduce them to ashes instead.
—‘ Fa| l Out’

We live in the silence after the scream

The stillness after the dying
Here in the dark you question what comes next

You wonder which way you’ll go
Azaadi
The burning of the sun
The shining of a distant star

In your eyes.

—‘ A zaad i ’
