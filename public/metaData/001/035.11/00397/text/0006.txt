(eekoliji)n-study of relations of living organisms to their environment; study of ecosystems;
study of environmental conditions of existence.

(A tale of everything and everyone)
lrnagine the history of the Earth as one month (one day being 150 million years), human
beings in their present form (homo sapiens) have only been here for a minute or so.
The Ecosystem is the complex web linking animals, plants, air, water, and every other life
form in the biosphere. It all hangs together. The system is in a steady state of dynamic
balance, which means that by altering any one part you affect all the others. Humans are
only one factor in the ecosystem. But we don’t quite see it that way. We set ourselves apart

and call all the other factors or species natural resources-or simply nature.
Human survival depends upon preserving the ecosystem.

It’s the boundary of existence,

the framework of human activity. The ecosystem can do without us, but we can't do without
the ecosystem. As long as we live on Earth.

Viewing nature as no more than a bundle of resources for human consumption is inviting
trouble.
Commonr’s Laws of Ecology :
1

Everything is connected with everything else.

2

Everything must go somewhere.

3

Nature knows best.
