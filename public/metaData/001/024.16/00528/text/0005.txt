--“Buro

Shaliker Ghare Ron”
by

Michael Madhusudan Dutta

The immortal author and poet Michael Madhusudan Dutta needs no
introduction. To immortalize his time through literature, he broke as if the
serene of heaven. The only manifesto he knew was that of literature. The

march of intellect in India had begun with him. More than a hundred years
ago.
His devastatingly irresistible sense of humour, his ability to generate
excitement, his charming, hilarious touchingly human writings are all too wellknown. The playlet “Buro Shaliker Ghare Ron”, allegorically, The Farcical

Lust ofAn Old Man is loaded with witty criticism against the hypocrisy of rich
men during the time of British East India Company in Bengal. The trick was to
expose the guiltiness ofthe men in power, at the village level. Of the playlet,
Rabindranath Tagore has said, “When I saw it on the stage for the ﬁrst time,
I laughed and laughed. And I still keep on laughing when I remember it.”
