‘Help Us To Help You’
“Cleanliness is next to Godliness” according to an old
adage. Clean surroundings radiate joy. More than that

they help in controlling diseases. On Railway Platforms,
in Waiting Rooms and in Carriages, etc., where people
gather, it is of paramount importance to maintain proper
hygienic conditions, to preserve the health of the
passengers. You can help the Railways in this ﬁght
against diseases by:

extending your cooperation for keeping
the surroundings clean and by availing
of the services of sanitary staﬁ’provided
at stations whenever required.
