HOW MANY OODLES
MAKE A CABOODLE -?
Or put it in another way—how many millions
make‘a gillion ? ln‘twelve years in handicrafts and

hand loom develoPment we have found that although
the last zero makes the million and millions of
zeros make a gillion, that “one” - I - which stands
ﬁrst is also most meaningful. No “one” means
no one!
In plain language the individual counts for the lot.
To us each human being is important, together

they make the abundance.
Our total turnover in handicrafts and handlooms in
the last ﬁve years has been fortyone million two
hundred and fifty ﬁve thousand rupees—an average
of more than 8 million a year. Compare that with
the time we began in I953 when it was l/4 million.
4l million rupees (the shareholders don’t touch a
pie because we are a non-proﬁt organisation)
translated means livelihood and hepe for many.
many million craftsmen who are heirs to a fabulous
heri:age~people we are proud to serve. l/4 m. to
8 m. That’s how the gillions come and the oodles

become a happy kit and caboodle.
