Reflections on CHARPAI
Flows...... .... ..the Time
Ravages of..........Time
Eternity of...........Time
Conspiracy of......Time
Flowst...........the Time
The CHARPAI brought in
For Old man to sustain
The little boy hides under
The Old clothes hang over
And within the crevices
The bugs take shelter.
The boy urinates
t
The bugs bite.
The girl—the back
of old man rides
Old clothes—to pull
To cover the filth, and
To uncover The vestiges of Time.

by A D I T Y A P RA K A S H
The old man's time runs out,
In walks his ghost, the sleep—
The man of the house—in torment;

Not torment—so much as
Extrication of thoughts
Pervading his soul-innermost.
GI ides the old man
Into eternity
Remains—his CHARPAI.
The old woman perceives
The tangles that together
The CHARPAI hold—the
Old man's ghost
Now seem to hold.
Loosens she—the tangles
Bit by bit-dismantles.
Binds together—the bits
like the ‘body' which

The 'soul’ has releasedThe remnants—she flings
After the old man
Into eternity—
Like his soul.
Peace—the deathlv peace
Restored—a shriek
The mother's lips—escapes.
Perceives--the mother
Her eternity
Before her eyes.
Cries out Shelu :
On my back—once again
I have to carry

The accessibility
Of the old clothes—and
the heredity.
