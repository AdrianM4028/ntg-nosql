The fire is lit, a glowing red flicker rises trernulously
and lotus-shaped flames leap upwards to embrace the sky.
Even as the flames consume the bodies-the framestory takes over. Hayavadana enters. On the advice of the
villagers, he had visited the shrine of Kali and pleaded
with her to make him complete, but before he could utter
the word ‘man'. Kali said, ‘So be it' and disappeared. So
his human-half vanished and he became a horse.

“But I am still burdened with one sorrow—this cursed
human voice. I am a stranger to the joys of neighing."
The narrator reminds him that he had warned him at
the very start of the workings of Providence.
Hayavadana looks into the distance and beckons to a
child. The Bhils in the forest around the Kali Temple had
asked him to take the child safely to his home.
The villagers try to get the boy to speak, to find out
who he is. Hayavadana tells them that the child will not
speak, nor laugh, nor cry. But his home is Dharrnapura.
Now the villagers begin to put two and two together.
They want to make sure that he has a mole on his
shoulder. But Hayavadana warns them to be careful. "If
you even so much

as touch the dolls in his hands,

he

bites."
So they approach the child warily, only to see if there
is a mole on his arm. The identification is complete. He is
Padmini‘s son. And as the narrator sings Padrnini’s lullaby
the child, till now silent and serious, joins in, riding with
joy on Hayavadana's back. And and at this point even
Hayavadana begins to neigh, much to his own delight.
