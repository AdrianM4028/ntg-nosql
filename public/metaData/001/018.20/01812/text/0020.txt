“That's why I brought my sword," says Devadatta and
Kapil brings out his. There is only one solution.
"We must both die." Whose is the head? Whose the
body? Is it murder or suicide? “But no question of mercy
now. We fight like lions and kill like cobras,“
They have taken leave of their senses,
Thrust their chests forward,

Poised to fight to the and!
Will / b a killing myself? 0 r you?
Even so their arms are now raised.
They both fall to the ground dead, the one struck
by the other’s sword. They lie, their bodies entwined.
Their minds were unc/ouded
It did not matter who killed whom,

Thus together they could defeat death.

Padrnini, clasping the heads of the two men, bows her
head, prays to Kali,

knowing that the

inevitable has

happened.
The narrator asks her if there is anything to be done.

“Take my son under your care. Let him stay till he is
five in the forest with the Bhils who loved Kapil. And
then take him to Dharrnapura and entrust his future to
Devadatta's father.”
“And you?"
“Make a funeral pyre for all three of us".
In the words of Thomas Mann.
