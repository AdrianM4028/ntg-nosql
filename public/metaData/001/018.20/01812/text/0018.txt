He says, “Why did you leave him? Come here seeking
for me? Go back to your husband. He is the winner.“
Padmini tells him. “He didn‘t win. Neither did you.
And I? I am neither the winner nor the loser. Maybe we
ought not to have come here, my little one? I really don't
know what brought me."

The flowing river, reckless like Radha!
You cannot engrave your love on water.
Nor wound it with a knife.
Free of the load of memories.
lt tosses, leaps, sweeps on . .
F/ounde rs in the rug of mass of its blue depths,
Only to rush forward again.

Padmini turns to Kapil again. “The boy is exactly like
you, with the same kind of mole on his shoulder." She

“One can beat a body

into shape. But the memories it nurses of a touch, of a
warm brush of the hand cannot be wiped away, “says
Ka p i l .

The scarecrow on the bank,
Sta res at the gushing flow.
lts rnudpot head is rent by a storm of memories.
There's a searing pain in its rag-and-bone heart.
But the river flows undivided, who/e, _
Free of the load of memories.
It moves forward, steers its way.

Kapil and Padmini retreat into his hut.
