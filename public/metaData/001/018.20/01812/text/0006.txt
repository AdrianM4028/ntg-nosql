horse. I n his fury, he cursed her, turned her into a mare,
and disappeared into the sky. The mother-mare pranced
away happily, leaving behind their offspring, Hayavadana,
half-man, half-horse.

tried to immerse himself in social ’causes'. But where is

Hayavadana hastens to leave, with the villagers showering
him with directions on how to reach his destination. At
