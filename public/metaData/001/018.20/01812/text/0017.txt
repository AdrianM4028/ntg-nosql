Padmini seems to have come to a decision. She
persuades Devadatta to go to Ujjain and buy new dolls for
the child. She herself picks up the child and leaves
for the forest. The scene describes her in the glade where
the three had earlier halted.

Let's go to the forest and taste its magic.
The ripple of water flowing, its soft music.
The hues of flowers and their bright trace ry.
Birds taking wing, soaring into the skies,
Nest/ing among green branches.
Tink/ing like ank/ets at the whiff of a breeze.
Red birds alight on palas trees,
Almost the streak of orange in my hair-parting,...
Let's soak ourselves in this red, my darling!

Kapil is seen in the forest, almost a recluse. He has
by now steeled through sheer will-power the delicate
body of Devadatta that had come to his lot.
Spreading my wings like an eagle / roamed afar.
Sped away like clouds, leaving so many skies
way behind.
And nowâ€” this mortal agony!
Padmini enters, child in arms. He wants to reject her
and the child which she says is the fruit of his body. He
cannot bear to think of this.
My wings are clipped, I am about to sink,
The blood that coursed in my heart now flows free/y.
Reddening the dust at my feet.
