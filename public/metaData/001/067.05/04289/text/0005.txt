The city of Varanasi has its own typical
character and life. It keeps flowing along
the Ganges in the same motion. Utilizing
these as a barometer, the author has
tried to expose the reality behind the
momentus socio-economic changes that
have taken place in the last decade of the
bygone century. These changes like else

r! lठन l

where in the world, have also affected
the life and moves of Varanasi. In fact, the

story mirrors the entire nation where
politicians have transformed religion into
savage fanaticism and culture has taken
a back seat.

Rampant and aggressive globalisation
has robbed the common life of its
simplicity and has given birth to perverse
greed and wild hypocrisy.

Or, are they two sides of the same coin
working together, for the benefit of the

chosen few...
The central character of the play,
becomes the symbol of the country on
one hand and epitomises the dishonesty
of the religious ambassadors
on the other. The play is
a telling exposure of
the contemporary
national scene,
though the
milieu is
situated
in Varanasi
or to be more specific
"Assi of Kashi".

The moral question
remains — are the
forces of globalisation
and the spirit of ancient
India, as propagated
by its advocates really
opposedto
each other?
