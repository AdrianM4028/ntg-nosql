Visa rian
Visarian directed by Habi b Tanvir (bn.
l 923), one of the country's major direc-

tors, as a joint production by his own group
Naya Theatre and Rangakarrnee, Kolkata,

is a maior theartrical event commemorat-

ing thirty years of the colourful career of
the Kolkota-bnsed Hindi theatre gourpi Actors frorn the Kolkata group, mainly from

the city itself, have the rare opportunity of

interacting with the seasoned folk actors
of Chhattisgarh, who have contributed so
significantly to the highly original theotrical

style

associated with

Tanvi r.

Directorially, Tanvir takes a fresh look at

Rabindranath Tagore’s play Bisarian (’Sac-

rifice', l 890), raising fundamental questions about the violence inherent in tradi-

tional religious rituals nurturing the streak
of cruelty into the rigidity of religious intolerance. Acutely‘conscious of the renewed relevance of the play in the mod-

ern context, Tanvir seeks to give his work
a wider locus by working with two groups,

widely separated in their locations; by retaining Tagore's original songs in Bengali

in their original tunes (as composed by
Tagore); by letting the people in the com—
munity scenes speak in Chhattisgarhi.
