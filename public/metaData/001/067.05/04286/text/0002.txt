Director’s Note
Visarian (Sacrifice) for all
The play is about the Visarian (Sacrilice/abandonment) ot Kali's
idol Tagore was against blood sacrifice in religiOus rites He
wrote more or less the same story first in the form of the novel
Raiarshi, and later With the same main characters as a play.
Visarian operates on several levels As always with Tagore, it is
no less a play about human relationships there is love and
conflict between Govmd Manikya and his queen Gunavati,
between the Purohit Raghupati and his disciple Jai Singh, between Jai Singh and the beggar girl Aparna, between Raia
Gavind Manikya and Purohit Raghupati The conflict extends to
State and Church, i e, politics and religion There is Visarian ot
the Dew, Visarian ot Jai Singh, Visarian of Love The spiritual
ideology of Tagore is equally strongly expressed in the play as
well as in the novel He lirmly believed in a direct relationship
