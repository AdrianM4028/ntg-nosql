India is a land of eternal music. Which has found
expression in its rich and varied tradition of songs.
If you listen, you can hear this music in its languages,
its dialects, in daily conversation.
When the rest of the world was crawling toward
civilisation, the sages of India were composing
divine music that took Indian culture to its peak.
In later years, Shri Chaitanya Mahapravu revived
the ancient Bengali theatre through the route of
music. He had realised that music would be the
eternal bond with the audience. The player,

The grandeur that Sisir Bhaduri had brought to
Bengali theatre evaporated with him. Grand
characters ceased to 'come on stage. The scale of
Bengali theatre shrank. And squeezed out its
heritage of great songs.
Bengali theatre has no more songs left.
I composed the songs of several of my productions,
“Teen Paisar Pala", “Bhalomanush”,“Amra Sabai

intact. Because it is built into our psyche, our very

In defining the role of music in our theatre, it is
sufficient to say that music is the heart and soul of
our theatre. Theatre and music are integral to each
