iv) The third decade began on a note ofapparent
calm but, throughout the world, storm
clouds were gathering. By 1929 the Great
American Depression had touched the whole
world. Nearer home, Gandhi launched his

“Satyagraha Andolan” in 1930. And in direct
response, the “committed” stage of Bengal
came up with “Karagar” by Manmatha Roy
(1930) with the inspiring music of the
legendary Nazrul Islam which moved the
British authorities to put him in jail.
The play was banned by the British.
The “entertainment” staged flourished with :
a) “Sita” by ]agesh Chowdhury (1924)
directed by the great Sisir Kumar
Bhaduri—an example of the growing
influence of Rabindranath Tagore’s music
on Bengali theatre.
b) “Satyar Sandhan” by ]aladhar
Chattopadhyay ( 1928) which became an
immediate and all time hit with the music
of Krishna Chandra Dey, immortal ised by
his ethnic music.
v) During the fourth decade, ending in 1940, the
world moved silently but inexorably towards
global chaos. By 1939, the Second World
War had begun. In India, the freedom
movement kept gathering momentum.
Confrontations with the British authorities
intensified. But there was no major reaction
to such social forces in Bengali theatre.
The “entertainment” stage remained
productive :
a) “Mahanisha”, a novel by Anurupa Devi,
was dramatised by ]ogesh Chowdhury
( 1932), the first Bengali stage production
of'a female novelist.
b) “Sirajuddaullah” by Sachindranath

vi)The fifth decade, ending 1950, was dynamic :

The world had lived through the trauma of
the Second World War. In 1941 the Indian
Independence movement moved into high
gear with Gandhi’s “Quit India” movement.
In 1943 came “Panchaser Mannantar" the
terrible famine of Bengal, masterminded by
the British, which silently claimed seven

million Bengali lives while the whole world
was in an uproar over Hitler’s extermination
of six million ]ews in Europe. In 1944, as

World War II drew to an end, Bengali theatre
took a great leap forward with the birth of
IPTA (Indian People's Theatre Association).
In 1947, came Independance. And, with it,
the division of Bengal. The “committed”
stage came alive during the decade with :
- a) IPTA’s “Nabanna” by Bijon
Bhattacharya (1944) which was

co‘directed by Sambhu Mitra, the living
legend of Bengali theatre.
b) “Ei Swadhinata” by Sachindranath
Sengputa 11949)

vii) The sixth decade began with Indenpendant
India’s first Parliamentary elections in 1952.
The Communist Party of India (CPI) emerged

as a political force.
The “committed” stage responded with :
“Rahumukta” by Biru Mukhopadhya
५
(1954)
The “entertainment" stage came up with the
all time hit :
“Ulka” by Nihar Ranjan Gupta (1954),

Isam’s music, one of his non'controversial

creations.
