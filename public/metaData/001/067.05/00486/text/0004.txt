Society faces the serious problem of "violence" today. The
youth and the student community are blamed for perpetrating
this violence.
The existent educational system is like a python that swallows
the dreams and hopes of the young and forces them to confront
a dark and

and

disillusinred future

frustrations.

Today's

filled

youth

with

and

"ABHIMANYU" and when he tries to

disappointments

students are

reach

like

his goal after

tearing down all the barricades then he gets trapped by the
giants of religions and politics.
The very hands that ought to wield pens, brandish weapons.
Eyes that should be lit with hope. srnoulder with anger and
indifference. Why are they forced into this situation? Why

do

their

minds

think

of

destruction

when

they

have

the ability to make a future for themselves. Holi revises all
these burning questions. Holi, originally a short play written

by well noted writer Mahesh Elkunchwar. developed into full
length play with the consent of the writer, during a one month
workshop in which more than 50 artistes including students
and

teachers

participated.

it was

conducted

by

Director

Smt. Usha Ganguli and a joint effort was made by the artistes

Er directors to develop the scenes and theme of the play through
a natural and realistic approach and the result was the successful play HOLl.
On the opening day of the play. playwright Sri Mahesh Elkunch-

war was present and witnessed the play and was very happy
because he felt that the whole additional portions were not
different from his own play and he liked the production which
amounted to a reworking of his play which was written twenty

years back.
