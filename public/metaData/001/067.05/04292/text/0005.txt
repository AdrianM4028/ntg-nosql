Usha Ganguli on Manto

I always had this feeling over the years,
looking at the developments taking
around us in our country, that Manto,
Saadat Hasan Manto, was much ahead of
his time. What I see around us today,
Manto had viewed 50 years back. Having

read Manto through and through over the
years, frequently I came across his
characters in my life as a social activist.
Let's talk about Manto’s womeri."-"I‘hey
are still living the same life they did,
when Manto created them. The human

truth, the truth that stares in our face ¸ 4
stark naked, and we cannot shy away
from that, living in an elusive awakening
of fake glitter that the people with power
have given us. That is why people who
knew Man-to, preferred to declare him
insane, than face his sanity which always
made them feel at inconvenience.
Manto’s vision was so vast that I could
not think of condensing him in one
production. After a detailed exploration
- and analysis of the man named Manto
and the writer Manto, I discovered three
broad viewpoints in his writings —
Women, Partition and the Human being. ’
I, myself, being a creative person, always
keep
humanity
above
anything.
Somewhere, on this line I could vibe with Manto, feel his thoughts and project them
on stage.
And the moment could not have been
less appropriate. On Jan 18, 2005 it was
the 50th death anniversary of the great
writer. As a tribute, we have undertaken
this trilogy during the year. To start with
Badnam Manto (his women), to follow
Sarhad paar Manto (partition woes) and
to wind up Manto Aur Manto (the human
being) have been staged.
