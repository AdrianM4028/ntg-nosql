Thanda Gosht (Cold Meat)

Kulwant Kaur senses a coldness and strained
effort in her manly lover Ishwar Singh’s ardour,
and demands, "Tell me the name of the bitch
you have been with who has squezed you dry’.
She draws out a confession, only after she has
plunged her lover’s dagger into his neck, and
‘blood spluttered out of the deep gash like
water out of a fountain,‘ and Ishwar tells her
how he had broken into a Muslim house, killed
all the six men in the house with his dagger
one by one, and taken away the one girl there —
‘she was so beautiful’ — only to find her dead,
when he laid her down and sought to rape her.
