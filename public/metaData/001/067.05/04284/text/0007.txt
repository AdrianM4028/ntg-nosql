The mother in spite of her
apprehensions is coaxed into
submission by her affection for her
daughter.The spell succeeds in steering
Ananda’s passions but when he returns
for Prakriti the sensitive girl realizes at

soulless body of a youth under a magic
spell. Filled with remorse she begs her
mother to take back the spell knowing
that it would cost her mother's life.

Peace through equality and self
knowledge.

when we consider the social, political
and religious conflicts that plague our
society even in the 2 l st century
India and the world at large with
various forms of discrimination ruling
the global scenario
