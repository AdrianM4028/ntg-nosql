position for itself within the rich cultural
heritage of Bengal and also as a newborn

which the Bengali cultural circle was not
much at ease—To break all the barriers and
reach out to the audience of not only
Bengal but the whole of lndia and in
countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan,

Now having successfully completed 34
prosperous years in lndian theatre with 35
productions and numerous prestigious
awards to its credit, Rangakarmee has
gained the confidence of starting an
ambitious है year project, RABlNDRA
RANG YATRA, in which keeping with its
tradition of bringing to the forefront social
issues — it aims at adapting and presenting

Rabindranath Tagore’s works by moulding it
in accordance with the contemporary social
scenario and in the process produces
something new and different from the
original source.
