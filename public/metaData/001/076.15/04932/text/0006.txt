Saudagar: Based on Bertolt Brecht’s
s“Exception
. and the Rule” ( Rang Vidushak)
Based on Bertolt Brecht'ss“Exception and the Rule” ,adapted and
translated into the Hindi by Shrikant Kishore, Saudagar basically
depicts how the system in which we live rules in favour of the
‘bigger man’, always shrugging off the poor and the deprived. The
play throughout speaks metaphorically of how the ﬁrst world
countries have hollowed out the pre-existing societies under the
pretense of discovery and modernization.
The saudagar in the play is the bigger man who gets away with all
the wrong-doing. With a hired guide and coolie, he sets out in
search ofoil to become even richer. He is unable to digest the fact
that the guide and the coolie are becoming friends. The saudagar
ﬁnds an excuse to ﬁre the guide. The coolie continues pandering
to. the saudagar for fear of losing his own job. The saudagar
tortures him to the extent that he himself begins fearing the coolie
lest he revolt. At one point when the coolie offers him his 0er
bottle of water, provided to him by the guide before he gets ﬁred,
the saudagar shoots the coolie dead, thinking the coolie was
going to attack him.
Throughout the play the clowns - the tilangas - are both actors and
spectators at the same time, for, they pass all the comments that
the common man has an ur'gre to make, but is unable to do so
owing to the constraints of the social system within which he lives.
The tilangas are able to do this in their 0er comic and humorous
manner. They are aware of every crafty move and ruthless action
performed by the makers of the law.
