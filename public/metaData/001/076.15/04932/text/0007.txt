the guidance of Shanti Bardhan in Murnbai. The formation as
well as the name owed not a little to the freshness of vision and
the bold spirit of experimentation, which had characterized
Shanti Bardhan’s work even in the earlier organizations to
which he had belonged. It was shared in good measure by his
colleagues.
In 1964, the Little Ballet Troupe shifted from Murnbai to Gwalior
and in 1984, Ranga Sri Little Ballet Trope shifted to Bhopal. The
present repertoire of the troupe comprises 37 full length ballets,
Manipur, Mayurbhanj and Saraikela Chhau dances in the form
of a number of short dance numbers which can be presented
independently or in conjunction with any of the ballets.

Rang Vidushak
Ever since its inception in 1984, Rang Vidushak has
fostered and groomed actors who, in their own way, have
carved a path of their own. It has made untiring efforts to
establish a rapport through performance and workshops
with society’s innumerable children. Workshops have been
conducted with the children of prison inmates, who are not
criminals themselves but live with the stigma of their family
background attached to them. The workshops have at times
been performance oriented but have very often also been
held just bring back a sense of joy and fun, always through
to take Rang Vidushak’s actors' training
this trying
methodology a step further from where it has reached.
