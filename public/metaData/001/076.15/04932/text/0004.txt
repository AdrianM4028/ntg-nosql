“RITUGURJARI” is based on the theatre of sound and movement.

Here, the media will be the poetry of Kalidas’s “Ritusamhar’, Various
Gujarati poems from medieval jain literature to modern poet's poems
on seasons, Gujarati folklore on seasons and seasonal folk dances of

.

Gujarat.

_‘

The aim is besides creating an entertainment, to familiarize the youth
with environment through Kalidas’s poetry and let them experience

the music, rhythm and the sense of movement veiled within it. This
meant understanding the content of the poetry as also the imagery

that it was creating through its rhythm & music. The focal point of the

production will be coordinating the voice with the movements of the
body. Poetry will be a vehicle for expression of moods within the
immediate space. Physical movements will be on task of blending the

patterns of the voice with those make it. One can see how poetry
gradually takes on the character of a musical form in harmony with the
movements of the body through dances as well surrounding space.
The objective is to lay emphasis on work process and eventually a
production. The process of reciting poems together in unison,
learning to listen to each other voice, listening to underlying rhythm
connecting the poems and above all giving the poems the character
of a song and dance. At interrnediately stages, narration in stylized
pattern will also take place.
