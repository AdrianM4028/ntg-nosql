Chakraviuh (Ranga Sri Little Ballet Troupe)
The story of “Chakraviuh” is based on the themes of the Mahabharat.
One of the themes in the story has also been taken from the Oriya
Mahabharat, written by Sarala Bass. The war described in this epic
ﬁnds its roots in the desire for vengeance. The ballet “Chakraviuh" is a
presentation of glimpses of incidents, which act as the fulcrum on
which the entire epical war rests. In truth, the Mahabharat is an epic
written during a transitional era, wherein human values and principles

underwent tremendous change. The change and transformations,
result in a gory battle. With all their powers, none of the sages, nor
Krishna himself, were able to intercept in the war developments.
