३" If winter is here
Can the spring be far behind”—
by V. K Shanna
Prithvi theatres is closed, Drama in Hindi has fallen on it’s

knees. Theatre in Hindi is stagering for lack of roots- roots of Art
are in the mass of life, and life to— day is in a coma—Goverrment
though sympathetic, is of little help because of its improper app—
roacn. And :n a desperate attempt to revive Drama in Hindi many

a unknown writers, Directors and actors are burning their precious
blood. On the face there are thousands cf groups, doing plays in
Hindi but most of them are like bubbles in a stormy sea and they
are soon devoured by their own whims and rosy dreams.
