DIRECTOR’S NOTE

Fourteen years ago I had presented

Jasma Odan in Hindi, to give the
students of the National School of
Drama some idea of Bhavai. At that
time there was a lurking doubt in
my mind about not only the

feasibility of transplanting a folk
form from one linguistic soil to
another but also the propriety of
such an attempt. Since then this
version of Jasma Odan has been
performed in some other Indian
languages including Kannada and
the positive response of the urban
audiences from different parts of
India has shown that we do share
a common ethos on the basis of

which regional dramatic forms, if
suitably recreated, can have a wider

relevance and enrich the modern
theatre.

Jasma Odan is one of the ﬁfty or
sixty surving playlets, known as
veshas, in the traditional repertoire
of Bhavai troupes. Like most of the
folk forms that evolved from the
Indian Uprupakas (folk plays) and
developed speciﬁc regional
characteristics around the 13th and
the 14th Century AD. the Bhavai

Veshas also project medieval values
which have now become socially
irrelevant and deserve to be rejected.

the continuous reality in our lives
and they have a great potential
for establishing an immediate

rapport, which is the most essential’
element in the development of a

modern theatre that is culturally
rooted. However, an attempt
to signiﬁcantly alter a traditional
text, without losing sight of the

basic ethos of a given folk form,
does pose some delicate problems.
Unlike the Swang or Nautanki,

there is no regular publication
of Bhavai Veshas. There is no
standard version of Jasma Odd/I
but all the Bhavai troupes have in
common a basic outline of a plot
glorifying the Sati ideal.
As the original story goes, Jasma

was the Apsara Kamakundala,
cursed by Nala Rishi to be born
on earth, in a community of
migrant construction workers (odes)
and to be married to an ugly,

lame man of the same community.
The Apsara, angered by the curse
of the Rishi, cursed him in turn

that he himself would be reborn on
earth as the ugly, lame man she
is to marry. As predicted, she
marries this man and remains
faithful to him, resisting all the
