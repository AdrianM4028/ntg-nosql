dynamic theatre personality who
had a major hand in nurturing and

expanding the company over the
years.

has produced a rich variety of plays
both classical and contemporary,
in several Indian languages, giving
a new depth and momentum to
the theatre in India. Not tied to any

available scripts the Company has
also successfully dramatised and
produced a few novels and short
stories in Hindi. In the past years its
repertoire has included foreign
plays in translations/adaptations.
