Writer— D irector’s Note

T O M Y C R l T l CS
We have had enough plays with some new, radical tantalizing, tought-provoking
story or the other. How about a play with an old one? We have had enough plays with
intellectual yearnings. How about a play without one?

‘Kankaal’ has no complex story. It is a play of acting, lighting and Music (and
of course Direction).
It is written and produced with only one purpose behind it,
advanture. Therefore, please do not try to analyse whether the situations in this play are
possible or impossible, because ‘it is the happening of impossible only, which frightens us
the Most’—FREUD.

Hence Q ED. = Terror (The whole purpose of the play)
