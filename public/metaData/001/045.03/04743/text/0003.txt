The play, ‘Trojan women’ follows the fate of the women ofTroy after
their city has being sacked their husbands being killed, and their
remaining families are about to be taken away as slaves.

In the history of epic ,”Iliad” reveals the reason for Trojan war is

womanhood. In the whole history of epics, women were arbitrated to be
the reason ofwars (Ramayana, Mahabharata, Iiiad, Odyssey).

women have regularly been excluded from the main streaming ofthe
male fantasized cultural area or marginalized from the from the culture
and history. In India we have women communities living ,still in slavery.

They are dalit women ofindependent India. Women of the dalit
communities are exploited in various dimensions for being born asa
woman in the Hindu culture as the low caste group. They are oppressed,
in their own society and are also debarred from all individual I
development, which is, social, economic and educational.

Here, trying to analyze, which process takes into dalitisation of
women’s of Indian society at the background of Trojan Women

by Jean-Paul Sartre.
