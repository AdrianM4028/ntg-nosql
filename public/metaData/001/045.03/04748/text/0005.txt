he devoted himself to writing continuing to pen short stories
and initiating his career as a playwright.

Between 1 933 and his death in 1 967, he authored twelve
plays-mostly light comedies. His first play to be
produced Aggie Appleby, Maker of Men, premiered in
1933 and four later plays were produced on
broadway: There's Wisdom in Women (1935),
Arsenia and Old Lace (1941), Four Twelve's are 48

...ln 1941 , New Yorkers are looking for
some entertainment to take their rnlnds off
of the war in Europe and the growing fear
that America would be pulled into it. On

exactly what they were looking for in
the form of a hilarious new play by
Joseph Kesselring, Arsenic and Old
Lace. The play becomes as
immediate critical and popular
success, running for 1,444
performances.
