Concept & Direction
Denis Maillefer (b. 1965) studied theatre in Lausanne and directed his ﬁrst play Fool Play For Love in 1987.
Over the course ofhis career he has directed more than 30 plays and several operas; has assisted Patrice Chereau
in Paris in 1988; has taught at Geneva’s academy and is a regular teacher at HE'I‘SR Lausanne. As the artistic
director of "Theatre en Flammes’ Mr.Maillefer is known for creating theatre that pushes boundaries. If he

happens to direct published plays like Cruel and Tender and Comedie de Geneve, he tends to give priority to
forms not intended for the stage, sometimes using literary material, and at other times creating actual
experiences with his actors for his audiences. His originality lies in exploring intimacy, discovering its music,
texture and paradigms, and creating performances that serve as violent, dramatic, emotional outlets. His work at
"I‘heatre en Flammes’ is an outcome of what one might call profound photo-journalism: it searches areas of
shadow to illuminate and insert into a frame. In 2010, he directed a play on Marilyn Monroe, and then Cherry
Orchard (l) with 15: year students in Lausanne. His next show will be a play by the Austrian author Handl Klaus.
He will also direct a project with a tiny audience in a real bathroom, with one actress and some foam.
