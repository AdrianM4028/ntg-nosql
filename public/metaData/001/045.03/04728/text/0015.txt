DIRECTORIAL NOTE
Four vachanas by the great twelfth century Kannada mystic and vachanakara, Allama,
poet of dynamic negation, poet of the ineffable.

One

On the hill of burning embers
Was a pillar of lacquer!
On the pillar of lacquer
Was a swan!
The pillar burned !
The swan flew,
O Lord of mystery and caves'.

Two

The fire of the town burned in the forest
The fire of the forest came to burn in the town
Hark, O hark! The blistering of the mug world — directions!

When Eye Sight touched the billowing a. d roaring
The Base Soul did a hopskipjump and ran!
It died countless deaths!

0 Lord of mystery and caves.*

Th re e

Amidst the forest of eyes in the centre of the town
There lie five corpses. They come,
They come and they weep :
They are a big family

Of friends and well-wishers.
The corpse does not burn,
Nor does the forest gutter out.
The roof, the body, it burns,

Burns, 0 Lord of mystery and caves!‘
‘In Kannada this is Guheshwara.
