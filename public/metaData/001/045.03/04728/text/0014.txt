was summed up by Ernst Toller as “the expression of self-contained superior cairn,”
and romantucnsm by Zola as “the restless regret of the old world.".....
For example, imagine what would happen if you were to think away the chorus
of saddened survivors at the end of a Shakespeare tragedy (the most cathartic point
of our involvement) and allow the hero to die alone and unattended, like a great tree
falling in an empty forest. Obviously we would be missing that indispensable frame
of social response from which the new and presumably wiser order will arise. But we
would also be losing a dramatic representation of our own emotional investment in
the play. Which is to say that we want the play to contain an audience to its own act.
I don’t know how far to
poraries, in whose work it is
evident, or at least changes
play’s society becomes more

press this idea beyond Shakespeare and his contemparticularly strong, except to say that it becomes less
its character, as the heroic principle declines and the
uniform. In the modern era, for example, the real drama

is the gradual isolation of the protagonist from any social context whatsoever. Society
is quite often absent (as in Beckett), or when it isn't. it goes about its business or
looks the other way (as in Chekhov). The emotion we have, consequently, is of a

very different order and scarcely a cathartic one. Consider the final scene of Hedda
Gab/er, which is designed precisely to create the sense of an ironic gap between
Hedda’s private motives for taking her life and the ignorance of those who survive

her. In short, put “Good god, people don't do such things!" against “Now cracks a
noble heart" and you see how drastically our representation on the stage has fallen
off over the years ........
