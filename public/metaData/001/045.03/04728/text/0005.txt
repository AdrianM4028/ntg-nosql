characters, time and story-frarnes. Time moves relentlessly forward in his plays,
while seeming simultaneously, via home comings and departures, memories and
fixations, to cycle endlessly back, and characters manage to waste what little time
they have in the present. This describes both universal human folly and the situation
of the pre-revolutionary Russian intelligentsia. The grandson of a serf, Chekhov well
understood the necessity of change and the burden of legacy. A long-time sufferer
of what would prove to be fatal tuberculosis, he lived more consciously than most
with the reality of transience. Gorky, later to become the voice of Soviet Russia, was
befriended and supported by Chekhov, who would have found the new world which
he helped imagine utterly foreign to his spirit and intentions.
