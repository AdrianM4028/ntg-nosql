DIRECTOR’S NOTE

Gaurav Sharma

While intervrewmg on prompters with theatre exponents of Maharashtra, I found that
(_३८३3५ t marginalization between Dalits and Brahmins still exists in the company theatres
even today Taking the figure of the prompter i found a medium to raise questions on
the 5000 political scenario

The CONNECUOH and relevancy of this idea is being conceived through the content itself
The Prompter has been that reality of the theatre world which has always been
bJackstage.

०

So performing him’ is presenting the hidden reality of the theater which।5 going to be
free from all illusion

Moreover the prompter has become the vehicle through which we can look at caste
hierarchy and politics in the company theatre system. in the end I would like thank my
mentor Abhilash Pillai है who has always motivated me to deal with this content .
lVloreover I would also like to thanks Bhaskar Chandavarkar, Asif Ali, and my batch
mates, Without their contribution and support this work could not have been possible.
Finally this production is dedicated to late Shri Bhaskar Chandavarkar
