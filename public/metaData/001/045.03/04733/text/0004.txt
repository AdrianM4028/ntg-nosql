Agriculture is one thing which has made human,
a human. This play belongs to the sixty percent
of Indian population who is being ignored

repeatedly by our government, media and us too.

since

since last ten years have proved this fact. The play

is not mourning on their deaths but a realization of
truth; a piercing truth which we all should face to be
a responsible citizen of this country. '
