married to Burjor, but the Irani couple suggest a plan. Hillamasi arrives
with her attractive secretary.
How Hillamasi gets to the truth, how the boys in desparation try to
get Gustadji predict winners at the races, how Hillamasi’s secretary exploits
the weakness of Dady and Eric, how Burjor receives a big prize in an essay
contest and how he fails to keep it, how Gustadji and Mahbokhtar ultimately help in bringing about a happy settlement and how Francis the
majordomo of the house, entangles every one with his idiosyncracies, are all
7
hilarious sequences which lead to a conclusive and happy ending.
