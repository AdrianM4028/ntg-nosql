The real dope
on Troy ~—
and Helen,

the girl
who

got tipsy

on the champagne
bottles she broke

launching

a thousand ships—
well, it’s caddlsh

giving you the
lowdown —

but there wasn’t
any battle

over there:
the Greeks

sent the Trojans handicraft gifts हैं _,
and the Trojans
sent them
Helen

For all the hes! in handicrafts and hand/cams
