I am happy to learn that the students
of Miranda House are staging Kalidasa's play
'Vikramorvasiya' on February 22,

Staging of classical Sanskrit play

1989.

is a very

difficult task and more so the 'Vikramorvasiya
which demands tremendous efforts to bring forth
the sentiments depicted in it by the great pdet.
I wish the venture all the success.
