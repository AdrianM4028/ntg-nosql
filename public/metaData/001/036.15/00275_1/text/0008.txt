15th February, 1989.

I

am

delighted

that

the

Samskrta Sangama of

Miranda House is presenting the most complex play of
Kalidasa Vikramorva'siya. The presentation of this play

is . a challenge because it demands the skills not only
of Vacikﬁbhinaya but also of the angika and especially.
sattyika. An attempt to present this play is itself a

courageous act.

I wish the Samskrta Sangama all success.
