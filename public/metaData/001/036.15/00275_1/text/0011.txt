I an glad to know that Miranda House, my alla later,
is taking the lead in staging a Sanskrit play

’Vikranorvashi'.

This indeed is a very good start

in trying to create an awareness of our rich tradition
and heritage. While several eXperilents on Sanskrit
theatre have been done by professionals, Miranda House
will set a very good trend if other colleges also take
up such plays for production.

I sincerely wish all the best to the entire team

engaged in the production of 'Vikramorvashi' and
I am sure that it will be very successful.

Acting Director
