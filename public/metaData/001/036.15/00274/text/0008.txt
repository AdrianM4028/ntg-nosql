15th February, 1989.

1 am

delighted

that

the

Samskrta

Sangama of

Miranda House is presenting the moSt complex play of
K alidasa Vikramorvasiya.

The presentation

of

this play

is _ a challenge because it demands the skills not only
of Vacik'abhinaya but also of the angika and especially
sattyika.

An attempt

to present

this play is itself a

courageous act.

I wish the Samskrta Sangama all success.
