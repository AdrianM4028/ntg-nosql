I am glad to know that Miranda House, my alla mater,
is taking the lead in staging a Sanskrit play
’Vikranorvashi'.

This indeed is a very good start

in trying to create an awareness of our rich tradition

and heritage. While several experiments on Sanskrit
theatre have been done by professionals, Miranda House
will set a very good trend if other colleges also take
up such plays for production.

I sincerely wish all the best to the entire team

engaged in the production of 'Vikramorvashi' and
I am sure that it will be very successful.

(Eh—s.) Kirti Jain
Acting Director
