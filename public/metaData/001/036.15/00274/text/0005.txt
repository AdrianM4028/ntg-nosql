I am happy to learn that the students
of Miranda House are staginE Kalidasa's play
'Vikramorvasiya‘ on February 22, 1989.
Staging of classical Sanskrit play

is a very

difficult task and more so the 'Vikrarnorvasiya
which demands tremendous efforts to bring forth
the sentiments depicted in it by the great poet.
I wish the venture all the success.
