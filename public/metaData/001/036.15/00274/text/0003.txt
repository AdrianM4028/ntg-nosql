I am pleased to know that Sanskrit Sangama of
Miranda House is presenting the play "Vikramorvastya"
of Kalidasa in College Auditorium on February 22, 1989.
Participation of students in the literary
activities through this forum, will give them the
necessary impetus and encouragement to do better in
their studies and attain excellence.
I send my good wishes for a successful performance

of the play.
With regards,
Yours sincerely,
