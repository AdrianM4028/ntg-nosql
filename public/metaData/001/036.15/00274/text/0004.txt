Sahitya is mirror of Society. In our country's history, distinguished
scholars, poets and saints have helped to resolve cultural conﬂicts and

achieve harmony in Indian thoughts and deeds. In this effort poetry has
played a great part. The greatest poet of Sanskrit, Kalidas by his everlasting

works enshrined in beautiful poems, transmitted eternal value of unity of
people. Theologically he wanted to maintain a separate identity for
individual so that he never lose his self—identity; philosophically, he wanted
to assert the reality of the world and positive nature of the Supreme, and
socially he desired to advocate through his powerful poems active and

optimistic life. His concept of duty was wide enough to include theological
as well as cultural duties. Normally, Indian concept of duties comprises

three types of activities : cultivation of ethical virtues like truth, nonviolence, tolerance, compassion; social duties like alms giving, helping
people in distress and theological, cultural and aesthetic activities like rituals
and worship.
Kalidasa's works are all pervasive. They guide everyone and

regulate every human behaviour. His message is inﬁnite and perfect in all
respects.
The staff and students of Miranda House deserve to be congratulated
in their efforts in making the message of Kalidas reach the people in general
and in students community in particular.
