I am very happy to know that Miranda House is staging the great Sanskrit
classic, Vikramorvasiya in. the original. I am sure such an exposure to Sanskrit

drama is valuable for the cultivation of a reﬁned aesthetic sensibility among the
paerformers and the spectators alike, but also for the growth of a healthy and artistic
indigenous theatre in the university campus. I wish every success to this
adventurous eﬂ'ort of the students and the faculty of the Miranda House.
