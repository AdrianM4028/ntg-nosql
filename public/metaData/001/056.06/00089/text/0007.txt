“. . . . . It is strange to me that so many people like to listen to so

many other people about the theatre.

There are thOS€ Who talk for

large fees or give it away at small dinner parties and often their

stories are charming and funny, but there are seldom people who
have done much solid work.”
You are there, you are good in the theatre, you have written or
directed or acted or designed just because you have and there is little
that you can and should be certain about because almost everything
in the theatre contradicts something else.
“. . . . . The manuscripts, the words on the page, was what you
started and what you have left. The production is of great import-

ance, it has given the play the only life it will know, but it is gone in
the end, and the pages are only a wall against which to throw the
future or measure the past.”
