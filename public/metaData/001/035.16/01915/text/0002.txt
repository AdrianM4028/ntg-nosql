SHA HA

Enemy of the People, the play deprc

doctor's lone fight against certain social evils. His elder brother
builds a residential colony. Nearby its water reservoir is a leather
factory owned by his father-in-law. The effluent from the factory
pollutes the drinking water in the reservoir and the doctor even
notices bacteria in it. He tells about it to his brother and also
suggests remedial measures which would cost the municipality quite
a tidy sum. The brother, who is also the President of the municipality, tells the doctor not to give out his findings. The doctor
refuses.
Here begins his lone battle. The doctor is not allowed to
use any place for meetings. The newspapers are pampered and
they cast aspertions on the doctor and his motives. The result ?
He is forced to leave the place and the job.
