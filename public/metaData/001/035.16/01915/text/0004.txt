TEE PHOOLRA Nl
by P. L. Deshpande

8 NOVEMBER 1975

(Adaptation of Bernard Shaw’s PYGMALION)
A professor of linguistics and literature vows to change the
social behaviour of any person; nay takes a wager to turn a flower
girl into a princess. His experiment revolves round Santu, an
illiterate, uncultured but innocent girl. Through superficial grooming of Santu's voice and manners, the professor succeeds in presenting her as a royal personage. In the process, Santu not only
emerges as ‘my fair lady' but also gets deeply involved with the
professor.

When, however, she realises that for him she has been

a mere tool for his experiment, she tries to leave him.

Her reaction

only serves to bring them together.
