KAU NT EYA
7 NOVEMBER 1975

by V. V. SHIRWADKAR

After the death of Dronacharya,
Karna becomes the
Commander-in-Chief of the Kauravas.
Throughout his life, this
brave warrior had been treated with contempt for being a 'Sootaputra'. One night, Kunti decides to go to Karna to plead for the
safety of her sons, the Pandavas, and to win him over to their side.
She reminds Karna that he is a prince and must, therefore, rule and
not serve. Karna refuses to be disloyal to his friend Duryodhana.
Kunti then tempts him with the privileges that a prince enjoys. This
also does not work. Finally, she chides him for not obeying his
mother and here Karna explodes and recounts her failure as a mother.
