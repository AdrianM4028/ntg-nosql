As is true of Nellis and Jennifer, Kathy, Liz and Donna add exciting depth to
the characters they portray.
My decision to start off the ’72-’73 AIS theatre season with such a strong,
probing play came after long sessions of soul-searching. “The Effect of Gamma
Rays on Man-in-the-lVloon Marigolds” is a psychological heavy. It is chilling,
hurnerous, wrenching, moving, very real “today.” It is a difﬁcult play—a lot
of people have made a lot of personal sacriﬁces to bring it to life. But, above

all, it is good theatre.
Over the past summer, as I attended .the‘ Edinburg Festival of

Performing

Arts, the Spoleta World Festival and the Berlin Film Festival, the idea that this
play is not only completely relevant, but would be a signiﬁcant undertaking
all involved, grew to conviction.

The moment of truth which was

captured as rehearsals progressed has given us—and, we hope, you—a beautiful
theartre experience. “Gamma Rays” blooms as a dramatic tribute to the truth
which Springs from commitment.
