BEATRICE—“This long street with all the doors shut and everything crowded
next to each other .
"And then I

start getting afraid the vegetables are going

to spoil ..

and that nobody's going to buy anything . . "

TlLLIE—f‘ln front of my eyes one part of the world was becoming another.
Atoms exploding ﬂinging off tiny bullets that caused the fountain, atom
after atom breaking down into something new."

RUTH—". . . it says that l exaggerate and tell stories and that I'm afraid of
death and have nightmares . .
