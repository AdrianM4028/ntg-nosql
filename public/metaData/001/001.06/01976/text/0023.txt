Sapagrasta Dasharath Swargarajya Uddhar
S YNO PS lS

The story of this bhaona is taken from Purana. There are actually two Phenomenons involved -- firstly, the King Dasharatha is cursed by Andhaka and secondly.
Dasharatha helps Indra to retain “Swargarajya” after lndra had been defeated by
Sarnbarasura.
During hunting in jungle, Dasharatha kills the only son of a sage (Andhaka)
mistaking him to be an elephant. Both the sage and his wife were blind and the
son was their only shalter
The sage and his wife also died being unable to bear
the sorrow of their son’s death. But before death, the sage curser Dasharatha to
suffer the same misfortune as that of the sages (This part refers to "Sapagrasta

Dasharatha" ).
In the following part ("Swargarajya uddhar") a demon named Sarnbarasura
acquires the Swargarajya (heaven) and expels lndra from the swargarajya. Indra
then seeks Dasharatha's help and accordingly Dasharatha kills Sarnbarasura in war
and reinstate Indra in the throne of swargarajya.
