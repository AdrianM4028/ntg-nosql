DIRECTOR'S NOTE
‘Door Desh

Ki

Katha' deals

with a hitherto

untouched

subject,

i.e. religious-

fanaticisrn and its effect. It not only exposes the hidden facts behind such socioreligious phenomena, but also comments upon its becoming farcical situation. The
play establishes the fact that religion as such should be kept away from the sociopolitical scenerio of our country.
The play has been crafted in farce: the whole thing comes forward in an
exaggerated form to make the problem enlarged. This provides a hilarious but not
least serious, development of dramatic crescendo, The play creates itself a world
of fantasy where every thing is nothing but farce, unveiling the reality.
The production proposes to utilise folk theatre devices and street play ( Nukkad
Natak ) and other urban theatre technipues at once. The informal presentational style
and flesible form of both rural and street theatre have creatively been interwoven
In the total structure of production.
Non-realistic—commedia dell
arte—acting style, improvised
minimal
props,
choreographic movements' different use of Rangapattikas and improvised costumes
are a few characteristic features of the production. Different popular audio-visual
aids are utilised in the play to achieve mass appeal,
