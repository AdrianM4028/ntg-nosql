Ku- Pratha
( Superstion )

The hearsay-like story speaks with a clear tone the saga of a country-in doldrurns having been devasteced by flood. Which though unwarranted, Occurs every year. The chief along with his subordinates-atthe helm-of affairs is found to take shelter in high lands completely
untauched by the horrifying accounts of devastating effect of the deceptive
guest~FLOOD Ill-fated consequences follow fernine. scarcity, cholera etc.
The common people become the feeder of the havoc the foul-play of
the ‘Haves’ when the Chief asks them to

migrate.

After few days on that no man’s Land, the man who came first,
he would be sacrificed and the condition would be revived as before,
it was the traditional superstition and belief of the local people. This
traditional superstitions were formed by the Chief for their own benefit.
But the common people belive that it was only the couse and its laws
of nature.
But some concious people protest and revolt against this traditional
butchery.
As a consequence the Chief supressed the revolutiories
with cruel hand. But they were not able to shower the barning tire
of the common—Once again the defence of the chief where he took
shelter had been trambling.
