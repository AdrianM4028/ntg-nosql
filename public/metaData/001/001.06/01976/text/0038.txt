Towards

Prosperity and

Self-Sufficiency

The tea industry which has always been a pride of Assam
saw a depressive
late sixties and early seventies. As a result of this, many
private tea garden
owners became indifferent towards the industry. By the time the Assam Tea Corpo_
in

ration was formed, many tea gardens became totally sick following glaring misman‘.
gement. The entire tea industry and its workers were exposed to uncertainty
, The
Government of Assam felt expedient to form

a tea corporation

to protect the interest

of the industry and its woakers and in the process the Assam Tea Corporation was
born in the year 1972.
Assam Tea Corporation not only carried out the normal business of the acqui—
red

gardens but also took the responsibility of shouldering

the

burden

of

some

other sick gardens which were almost abandoned‘
During the past two decades the Assam Tea Corporation has engaged itself
in the task of nursing the sick tea gardens into heth and to herald a new era
of prosperity and

self-sufficiency in the face of

inumerable adversities.

Today the Assam Tea Corporation with fifteen tea gardens is one of the leeding tea producing Companies of Assam with its total working force of 16500 covering a total area of 6779 hectares, It contributes today five percent of the total
tea production of Assam and is one of the country's best quality tea producing
Companies,
The Assam Tea Corporation has recently taken up an ambitious development
project which is under implementation, The project is expected to be completed by
1996 and on completion the production level of the corporation gardens is eXpected to go up by 200 percent by the turn of the century.
