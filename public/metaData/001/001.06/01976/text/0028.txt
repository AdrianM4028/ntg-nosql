In ‘Atithi Narayan’ there are three characters—Robin, Gopa
&

lswar or God.

Robin,

Progressive,

rational

minded

with

a

revolutionary past, is a school—teacher with a simple God-fearing
wife Gopa—into whose lives suddenly enters a new neighbour
who announces that he is God.
The play is a tense & tant drama that explores the relationship of man with God and focuses on the dilectic between
belief and uebelief, between human responsibility & faith in God.

Through dialogue that is frequently witty, occaionally profound
-& always sharp & probing the lives, hopes & fears of the
husband & wife are revealed (the death of their young son :
the imminent love-marriage of their daughter;
the husband’s
desire for promotion & recent crisis in his school; Robin's
commitment

to science

& reason,

impulses of the heart etc.

Gopa's on

emotion &

simple

etc.

The plav reaches a sharp climax as Robin & Gopa persist
in their aggressive guesitioning of God’s ways & motives. At
curtainfall the devions ways of man's heart & mind lie revealed
& God has the last laugh. Man is left not with belief in God
but with awareness of his human responsibility.
