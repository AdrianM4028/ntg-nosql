The show commences with the foreplay of Yakshagana Bayalata. Each person following his
own vision of life tries directly or indirectly not to harm others. Those who follow this principle
are considered to be the avataras of Dharma. With these words, the study of art of

Yakshagana begins at the house of Bhagavata at the advent of monsoons.
Sunder who is eager to learn the art of Yakshagana begins his training with the knowledge
that eagerness should be accompanied with responsibility. By learning the subtleties of art
and dance, Sunder transforms himself into a charming actor and wins the praise of
Bhagavata. The music, dance draws Sunder towards Lalitha and leads to their union.
As their affair progresses Sunder's uncle visits and takes his nephew Sunder along with him
by force.
Sunder who accompanies his uncle to Nandara Bidu is unable to forget his distress and
Lalitha. But incourse of time he transforms himself and symbolises contemporary 535“ :- - ..

the old and new Sunder. He justiﬁes his life-style and when the truth about the
( है::',
birth of Lalitha's son Subbu who is Sunder's own son is revealed to him he is not
able to digest this truth and runs away.
Lalitha decides to reveal the truth about the birth of her son to Bhagavata who is
the epitome of Dharrna and who showers incomparable love on her. Bhagavata
acknowledges the truth without hesitation and accepts Subba as his son. Lalitha
passes away. Bhagavata who is drown in his sorrow due separation from his wife
realises that art in the form of his son sounds the gong to encourage him to
proceed with his art.
