MESSAG E
It gives me immense pleasure to know that National Theatre Festival Bahuroopi
~05 is being held at Rangayana premise in Mysore.
India is a veritable treasure house of folk and traditional/indigenous art forms.
The folk art and traditional culture performance showcase the vibrant profundity
and plurality of India's indigenous arts, which have the opacity for renewing and
rejuvenating themselves while maintaining a continuity and antiquity and
tradition. Origin of Indian theatre is closely related to the ancient rituals and
seasonal festivities of the country. These types of festivals offer narrative
structure and methodology of theatre practice on varied theatre art forms.
Interaction with artists and experts and exposure to various forms of theatre
generate in the participants a new philosophy, methodology and aesthetics to
fuse learning with the life and environment as inheritors and promoters of India's
great living tradition.
I wish all success for festival.
