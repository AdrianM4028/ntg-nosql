Talent certainly is not inherent
but acquired and is cultivated like

rice and wheat, yields manifold
when mind and muscles sweat—
It would not b 3 an exageration if
Drama is branded as the worthy
child of two faculties :-—~ science
and

Arts Nevertheless it deals

with human

problems

and its

solutions with delight and instruction as the basis. An ignorant can

only ignore this. And certainly one
has the right to contradict but
probably in vain. Drama develops
when

public

participates

and

people patronise. Also, the rapport
strengthens when publ?c and
performers try to understand and
encourage each other.
