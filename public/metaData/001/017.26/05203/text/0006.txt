HOMAGE TO GANDHI A Collage of the Performing Arts.
Darpana’s ‘Homage to Gandhi’, a Mrinalini Sarabhai mosaic, is a montage of many forms of visual art
aimed at a prismatic perception of a single truth—Bharat, of a Sinn Fein—Gandhi, of the Simon pure—a
Bharatiya. In an angry outburst of instinctive energy, much like the mad slashing of a canvas by the
hungry painter, Mrinalini has cocktailed traitionally Bharatiya art forms to achieve COIISpeCtUS and, in
the process she has united thought with action, art with life and put forth, in varying patterns and light,
Visions we have put dimly seen and enriched our view of reality with visual music. Considering that she
uses Bharatanatyam so meticulously absorbed in beauty, to depict Death, the age old theatrical tradition
of India to merge into Surealism, songs in the manner of Sirocco, a part of Tagore’s opera as an opus,
mixed Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, English at will and wantonly, and audience participation to make us a
part of her programme, the heritage of the past does not seem to burden her. It shows up as her most
treasured possession.
It is an artist’s task to enrich man’s feelings towards reality by presenting it to him in ever varying
patterns and lights and so fortify him in his struggle to change it. Usually an artist does so with all the
lies at his Command. To be able to do so—portray ‘truth’ with no lies—in a pattern which might easily have
turned into a hideous cacophony is no mean achievement. So far, it is about the best of the Centenary.

Mukherji in ‘ENACT’

We have seen how Mrinalini has presented Gandhji’s pilgrimage of life through small incidents. After
Gandhiji’s death it was the reSponsibility of the whole of India to develop his work further. Instead
af'ter Gandhiji’s death we have succumbed to the evils of power and wealth and Gandhiji’s mission has
been forgotten.
This mission Mrinalini shows us with ruthless clarity.
