KATH AK AL I

Bhaskaran and Gopinath who donned the roles of Nala and the Swan were faithful to the idiom. Every

Nala Charitam was brilliant achievement. Pruned and trimmed, it brought out the essence with precision.
Authenticity of costumes and accompaniments was well maintained. Music was unusually good. Haridas

thin to suit the moods.

elemental issues concerning man and his environment. In this sense, Mrinalini’s dance is at once modern
in theme and ancient and traditional in style and form.
