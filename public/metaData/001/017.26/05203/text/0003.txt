The British Broadcasting Corporation has commissioned a 50 minute colour documentary on the noted
classical dance exponent Mrinalini Sarabhai.

An eight-member BBC team has arrived in Ahmedabad to ﬁlm the documentary. It is headed by
Margaret Dale, producer in the Music Department of the BBC and Rosemary Sadler, Assistant Producer.
They told newsmen on Saturday that the ﬁlm to be completed by February 27, would be shown in the
Sunday evening series on music on the Corporation’s network in England.
