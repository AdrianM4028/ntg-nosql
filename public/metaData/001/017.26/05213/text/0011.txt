Disciple’. We are indeed blessed to view this magnificance.’
Of ‘Shakuntala’, which was staged in 1971, Mrinalini says, ‘All
thought to me is dance and once an idea takes root in my being I have to
let it go into movement. Though ‘Shakuntala’ followed Kalidasa’s
story, I could not agree ' with the end. Suddenly the idea came to me to
make Shakuntala ask King Dushyanta, “If the ring is not with me, it
must be with you. Surely a king would know where his signet ring was
‘P” Shakuntala in the end rejects everyone and says, “We come into this
world alone and we get out alone, I have no need of anyone to protect
'
me.”
Deeply disturbed with the plight of the downtrodden and the
torment in the world around, Mrinalini expressed each human action
in a dramatic movement of dance . The terrible burning ofthe Harijans
was first re -created by her in a short piece called ‘Ranmalpur’ which so
stirred audiences that she was requested to take it all over the country.
‘Chandalika’ by Rabindranath Tagore was a re-interpretation of the
theme of social ostracisms. ‘At some moment in time we are all
Harijans’, says Mrinalini, ‘rejected by our families or by society or by
existence itself. ‘Chandalika’ is the isolation and loneliness of every
human being in the drama of life.’ A critic wrote, ‘Chandalika was
purposive art at its best. It was a familiarly pleasing yet disturbingly
new experience. As one Shakespearian character enamoured of music,
we feel tempted to tell Mrinalini, ‘if this be experimentation in dance
form, give us more of it.’
‘Witnessing Mrinalini’s “Chandalika” at Sadler’s Wells was to peep
into the 21st century of Indian dance,’ wrote the critic of India News,

London.
Mrinalini has always found a need to go beyond themes or ideas and
explore the abstractions of movement and form. ‘Rig Veda’, or ‘The
Song of Creation’, was an experiment in sound, silence, movement and
music, of which The Times of India critic (1969) wrote, ‘Mrinalini
Sarabhai’s “Song of Creation” is a landmark in modern Indian
,dancing. And so long as we have dancers like her, we can look forward
to bold experiments. It is the product of a restless soul creating her
own idiom to fully express the richness compressed in her.’ ‘I love the
sound of silence’, says Mrinalini. ‘I find sometimes, music disturbs the
purity of my thoughts. The Rig-Veda was created while I was sitting
alone, but in the distance was the sound of chanting. So it formed a
distant background to pure movement but had really no connection

with the dance.’
‘Aspirations’ choreographed in 1979, was a depiction ofthe search
of the ‘Atma’ for understanding and knowledge. Soaring beyond time,
waiting for grace, man relentlessly destroys and in destroying finds
