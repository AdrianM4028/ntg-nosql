‘Megha
Kalidasa’s poem which is a combination of man’s desire, the/beauty of
nature and the influence of the universe upon man. This poem, she felt,
should be presented to every citizen today to understand his own
cultural background, in an age where we are so concerned with
ecological disasters around the world.
Mrinalini also choreographed a dance-drama on the life of Jesus
Christ called ‘Snehana Shatadal’ (A Thousand Petals ofLove). She felt
that it had great relevance to the present world riddled with violence,
war and unrest. It was specially produced at the request of the Society
of Jesus, Gujarat.
For the Tagore 125th centenary year ( 1987), Mrinalini brought to
life through dance and movement, the relevant topics of our present
day world, in the poet’s own words, showing how great and prophetic
was his vision.
Nikhil Chakaravarty, the distinguished political commentator

wrote, ‘Mrinalini Sarabhai’s “Tagore Poem” in the recent Tagore
festival moved me very much. What a wide spectrum was covered—
from the atrocities against the downtrodden to the philistinism ofTV,
to the call for life against nuclear death, to the pride and glory of our

past, intermixed with the hope and confidence for the future... how
strong its message could prove in cementing national integration.’

“I'he echoes of the world around, the reﬂection of our lives within
and without, the experiences that create and shatter man, this is our

Darpana, the mirror’, says Mrinalini of her production ‘Abhinaya
Darpana .’
Malcolm Adiseshiah writing about the collage ‘Homage to Gandhi’
says, ‘It has been a moral experience. Mrinalini through her artistic
creation, has brought home to us the vivid truth, which our society and
our world seems daily to deny and for which Gandhiji lived and died.’

EXPERIMENTS
In 1963, Mrinalini was invited by the New York Institute ofAdvanced
Studies in the Theatre Arts to direct the Sanskrit play ‘Swapna
Vasavadatta’ with American actors in classical Sanskrit drama
t'echni qu e .
An American described her as ‘a guru with a light, soft, gentle
touch—strong enough to take root in my life.’
During the bi-centenary celeberations of Beethoven in Italy, 1970,
an unusual experiment took place, with a dance dialogue between the
East and the West. Mrinalini was invited to represent the East and the
well-known ballet dancers Milorad Miskovitch and Carla Fracci

represented the West in a dance-drama to Beethoven’s “The Creatures
of Prometheus’, which was shown in many cities of Italy.
A rare manuscript of Schubert’s, on the Indian classic ‘Shakuntala’

was found some years ago and was handed to Mrinalini. What resulted
was a unique dialogue between the East and West of which Kurier of
Vienna states, ‘An unusual contribution to Schubert year. It is colour
and poetry — mysterious in its manifold expressions of the Indian

dance style — successful in its effect to transform the wonderfully
melodious and truly valuable Schubert music.’
‘Chitravali’ was a venture where Mrinalini captured, in moments of

inspiration and acute sensibility, the paintings, sculptures, and the
works of art through the centuries. It was an attempt to preserve the
rich beauty of India’s heritage for posterity.
