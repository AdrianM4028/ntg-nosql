‘Mrinalini Sarabhai puts
colour. rhythm and
movement to the service of
birth. love. death, worship
and play. with an
indescribable beauty and
purity. Seeing her is seeing
the genius and spirituality of
an ancient time recreated in
perfect harmony.’
—A French Critic.
‘No other Indian artist has
made such successful
attempts to weave the

unlimited vocabulary of the
Hindu dance without losing
something of the fine
artistry.’
-Dancing Times, London.

‘There have been
presentations before in
Berlin by individuals, and
even by famous Indian
temple dancers, who always
seemed to be static in their

symbolic Mudras. NOW FOR
THE FIRST TIME IT IS
DANCE. TURNING LOVE
PRAYERS TO THE DANCING
DEIT’IES INTO DRAMATIC
MONOLOGUES OF THE
BODY—AND THERE ARE NO .
MORE LIMITS OF
UNDERSTANDING. Mrinalini
and Mallika Sarabhai,
conveyed to us the oldest
Bharata Natyam dance with
its Jatis, sparkling and
expressing with perfect
feminine grace and yet most
precise pliability.’
-Berliner Morgenpost

‘Mrinalini Sarabhai has
succeeded in giving new
form to Indian dancing. It is
a lonely path to lead, but she
is bold enough to do it.’
—Hindustan Times

‘Chitravali was a visual worship of Art, its sanctifying, near
cathartic intensity inviting us to participate in some of the most

memorable past experiences that live on,’ wrote a critic ofthe Express.
Mrinalini worked on ‘Savitri—The Flame of the Future’, based on

Sri Aurobindo’s philosophical poem with music
America’s famed modern composer Joel Thome.

THE ACADEMY
In 1949, Mrinalini formed her group DARPANA and along with it
started a school to train classical dancers. Her pupils continuously
won first prizes at national and international dance competitions for
purity of Traditional Technique.
Through the years, Mrinalini has expanded the activities of
DARPANA. There is today a fully trained drama company which, apart
from regular shows, has investigated every form of drama.
For ten years, in order to encourage young Gujarati playwrights,
Darpana undertook the production of every original play it was
offered.
The Academy has an active Puppet Department. Both traditional
and modern techniques are explored and presented for all age groups
in India and abroad.
The Music Department, also with its own professional group,
teaches classical “vocal and instrumental’ Hindustani and Carnatic
music.

The Academy also invites well-known artistes from around the
world to teach and conduct workshops in the various departments.
