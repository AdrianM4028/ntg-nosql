The Darpana school of dance, drama and music has been
created to promote education in the arts, to preserve the religious
inspiration. fundamental precepts and traditional techniques of our
classical heritage.
The Darpana company strives to maintain only the highest
in artistic and technical standards and to contribute through new
creations a constructive force in contemporary art life.

The Darpana research and experimental unit maintains an
extensive library of manuscripts, and books and hopes to undertake
a valuable publication programme. For experiments and study in
production. lighting, costumes etc. a small theatre has been constructed.
Special facilities are provided for any organisation in the city wishing
to utilize the theatre for educational and artistic purposes.
