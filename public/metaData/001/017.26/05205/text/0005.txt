The Music
Jayadev’s Geet 60vind is perhaps the earliest text available
that mentions Ragas

and ’I‘als with compositions, which means that

the Raga theory had, by this time been ﬁrmly established. (Raga is a
finely judicious and the most logical conclusion of the melodic idea).

Rag as :
The Raga structure is based on a fundamental scale and this
itself has changed so often during the last 800 years that it is difﬁcult,
in fact almost impossible, to interpret the music of Jayadev’s times.
(12th Century.) The structure of a Raga had also changed due to the
concept of sthayi bhava which came much later than Jayadev’s time
that is the 15th and 16th century.

Again some Ragas mentioned in the text by name, exist today

in the north and some in the south.
Gurjari and Vasant are common in the north while Varali, and
Ramakriya are known in the south- Raga Malav is found today only
iu the music of the Vaishnav Haveli Sangeet of Vallabhacharya~ We
have chosen such forms as exist now.
Maya Malav Gaul is taken as a Sthayi Variety of Malav.
Saveri was chosen according to South Indian tradition to avoid
the frequent repetition of Gurjari.
