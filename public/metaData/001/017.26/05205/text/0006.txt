Tals: The same difﬁculty exists in interpreting the tals mentioned in
Geet Govind. Yati is a typical example- Yati surely must have been
the name of a tal in Jayadev's times, but the later books mention
yati as one of the ten elaments-fundamental musts-(Dasa Pranas) in
atal. Yati today means a rythrnic form. Roopak is another example.
Roopak in the north is the Tisra Jati 'I‘riputa tal of seven units

(rnatras) (the well known chapu of the south) while in the south it is
commonly a time measure of six units\

.

The yek tal is taken to mean any tal of from one to nine
units and thus Adi and Jampa have both been included.
It is a stupendous task to unearth the correct Ragas and tal
modes of the 12th century. We have done our best to incorporate the
available material trying at the same time to create the proper musical
atmosphere for this interpretation of the Geet Govind.
