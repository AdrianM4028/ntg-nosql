B H AVAI

Bhavai—the traditiOnal folk drama of Gujarat has
been prevalent since 1560 AD. It's form is based on
social satire and, is a' colorful popular folk theatre on
the verge ३ 0f extinction as in recent times Bhavai
troupes do not have enough patronage, a

artists and other young

artists

started

few

joining

veteran

drama

companies and doing other jobs I thought this powerlul
indigenous art form Would vanish ३ from the“ cultural

"world of Gujarat. I requested the veteran artists to teach
me a few "Veshas‘C but they would not due to thetr
religious belief or fear that I would misuse this ' art

against their livelihood, After a lot of persuasion they
taught ‘me the traditional "Veshas" of "Joothan" "Zanda

Jhoolani' and “Che'l Batau" and में । complied this into a
programme called "Gan’pat Gujarat‘,’ with the aim of
using this traditional form with contemporary themes

and `1३ reinterpreted and
Jasma and Guru

Ganika

Bhavai

is

said to

owe it’s beginnings to Asaita a Brahmin of Mehsana
District who was excommunicated for marrying a Kanabi
Girl; an actor and singer he cleverly combined social
satire in his comp wsitions and all his descendants came

to be known as Bhavaiyas. I am proud I was the first
actress to p r orm tra
