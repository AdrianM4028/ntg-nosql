DIRECTOR’S NOTE
Jonathan Livingston Seagull was different from the rest of his ﬂock. The goalless lotuseater existence of his comrades held little charm for him. He was acquainted with the
latent potential of his own mind and body, and strove to develop it. In spite of being
ostrasized and exiled by his ﬂock, Jonathan was able to overcome the fear of discover—
ing the hitherto unknown realms of ﬂight and freedom, alone.

He returned only when

he felt conﬁdent that he had achieved mastery over his faculties, both mental and
physical, and set abOut convincing the ﬂock of the beauty and power of his newly
acquired Skill.

As I interpretit, the philosophy underlying jonathan’s story as portrayed by Bach, is
very relevant to human beings. It is a philosophy that emphasizes the need for a purpose

oriented life, where there is a consistent endeavour using all one’s capacities to the utmost
to reach one’s goal, even in the face of strong opposition.
life and its experience are enriched.

As a consequence of this,

Also contained in this philosophy is the need to

share the knowledge, gained through one’s effort, with others.

Bach COHVBYS these ideas thl‘Ough the medium of ﬂight in a seagull’s life. On stage
and in dance it is translated into controlled body movement. A complete and conscious
control of both the body and the mind, it is to man just as ﬂight is to the sea-gull.

It has'been a new experience for us to experiment with body movement.

We have

enjoyed it, and we hope you will too.
