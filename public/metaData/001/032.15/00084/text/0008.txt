_ History owes a debt :0 three lndian
mathematicians of 1500 years ago who
develop-ed Algebra to give meaning to -'
the meaningless. Bhaskara, who
i
originated the radical signs.

Erahmegupta, who created the
symbols. Aryabhata, who worked out
the first equations. Original thinkers.
they expanded man’s horizon in his
unending search for knowledge. A
search that continues today in new
directions with newer tools . . . among
them. a machine that helps man in
" more ways than any other invention in
history : the computer. We are proud
that iBM introduced the manufacturing
of computers and other data
processing equipment in India. which
are helping the nation meet the
challenge of building a new tomorrow.
