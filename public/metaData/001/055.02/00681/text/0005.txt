Twiehempati stands at the cross
roads—starvation and persecution
facing him if he refuses; if he
accepts it entails a severe moral
compromise killing the man in
him. Crisis brings out the best in
him. He defies the temptations
of secure living, refuses bluntly
to be trapped any further and
throws off the false and stifling
cloak of an imposter. As he faces
the music with a tranquil courage,
the ordinary man attains extra—
ordinary dimensions.
The cast includes his wife, son
and daughter, his brother-in-law
who serve as a counter-foil by
surrendering, and an old woman
who is a neighbour. The menace
of the power that rules is
suggested through two local
toughies. Working within this
small and tight framework, the
young playwright Debasis
Majumdar achieves wonders.
He recaptures the feel of the

period he depicts, late seventies

in West Bengal. with power and '
authenticity. His dialogues are

१ penetrating, realistic and rich
with verbal resonance. His
characters are three-dimensional
as they react to situations and
grow along with the play. He
keeps the tension unflagging and
reaches the climax with consummate ease and without any
forced theatrical ity. Indeed, in this
his very second play, he develops

on his first Dansagar, a play
based on a Premchand story that
he wrote for Theatre Commune
of Calcutta in 1976.

The Sudrak production is sensi—
tive without being sensational.
Bare and austere stage decor,
precise but meaningful use of
light and darkness, restrained but
moving performances do absolute
justice to the text, Dwijen Ban-H
dyopadhyay, the vei‘yyoung
director of the play who also acts
the main role, shows an unerring
eye for details but does not miss
the essential for the incidental.
The play and its production remain
for me one of the most significant
theatre experiences in recent

years.
