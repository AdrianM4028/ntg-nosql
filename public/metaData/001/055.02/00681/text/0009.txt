From the inception of Awishkar
in the year 1971, there were »
certain objectives in the minds
of the founder—r'nembers. The
first-rate production of new,

theatre has come to stay,
provided we are allowed tocontinue in this hall.

meaningful plays was, of course,
one of them. But certainly not
the only one. in fact this was an
‘instrument' really to achieve the
goal. To produce a new play as
best as one can and then start
the search for another play is a
routing often followed by all the
drama organisations. Awishkar
wanted, consciously, to avoid
this.

Nearly 50 experimental units have
given over 700 shows in this hall
so far and increasing audience
attendance in the small auditorium shows that the hall has
become a ‘Habit' now. This
situation was unthinkable just कि
four years ago. Even organisations
from outside places situated in
Maharashtra State like Poona and
Nasik have started performing.
their plays in this hall, and also
the organisations from outside
Maharashtra State, i.e’. from

Awishkar had pledged to strive
for laying the foundation of a
theatre movement which; through
serious approach, would help
develop the various branches of
theatre and which would continue
to thrive unhampered in Bombay
City in particular and Maharashtra
State in general.

The availability of a central place
for all the activities was posing
a main problem. This problem
was temporarily solved clue to the
generosity of the Governing Body

of the General EduCation Institute.
Bombay. Awishkar has been
allowed the use of the School

High School, a school run by this
institute. The hall is situated in
Dadar, a suburb of Bombay, and
is available to Awishkar on
all the evenings except may be.
about 20/25 days in a year. in
return Awishkar pays Rs. 3,000
to the institute as compensation.
If the total rent collected from
other institutions exceeds this
amount then that also goes to
the School.
This was the oportunity we were
waiting for. Awishkar decided
to allow all other drama organ isations like itself, to make use
of the hall for their shows with
an intention of establishing the
place as a cultural centre for the
struggling theatre folk of the
city of Bombay. That these hopes

Were not unfounded is provided
by the response Awishkar

received from theatre—people as
well as the serious theatregoers
in last four years. Awishkar is

Baroda, Hyderabad etc. have also _
staged their plays in this hall, In
addition to Marathi and Hindi
plays Gujarati, Malayalam and
Tamil plays are also staged.

Besides running of this" school hall Awishkar conducts worksops
for voice culture training, acting
and direction and for children.
Girish Karnad's Tughiak, Badal
Sircar's Saari Fia'at, C.T. Khanolkar's Pratima. Vijay Tendulkar's ‘.
Pahije Jatiche and Shantata
Court Chala Aahe have been
some of Awishkar's significant
productions.

Fi'aktabeej attempts to explore
and understand the complex
strands of our contemporary
society in which the mutual interdependence of the constituents
creates a situation of mutual
exploitation in which the exploited
is no less an exploiter and the
ostensible humanist benefactor, ‘
a sophisticated exploiter who in
his turn is exploited.

The end result of these expioitive

situations is murder or sulﬁde.
But what is ostensibly suicide is
in fact a murder and murder
also blurs into suicide.
The playwright starts his play
with a discussion which dwells
upon these aspects of the play
but the effort is not to present dry
proofs for a thesis but hopefully
to illumine the thesis in a
humanist framework.
