“iii Festival
Instead of the usual seven plays.

this year we have nine. The
two languages which have so far not featured in the previous
festivals are Manipuri and Tamil.
The attempt this year too has
been to give an opportunity to
Delhi audiences to see some of
‘ the most significant work being
done all over the country.

Apart from a few short plays
which were improvised, the
two directors produced two

plays, one in Tamil and other in
'
Malayalam.
The Tami I play, Pinam Thinnum
Sasthirangal is basedvon
- - r Subramanya Bharati's classic
'Panchali Sabadam,. Though the
play strictly speaking is only
a take off from the poem

The Festival opens with a play
by a very young playwright—in fact his first original play—
which has been a real event in
the Calcutta theatre. In the
words of a fellow playwright.
Debashis Majumder’s Amitakshar
is "one of the most significant

theatre experiences in recent
years." This year there are two
languages in which we are presenting not one play but two
plays each. The other Bengali

play is Manoj Mitra's Saiano
Began which'was one of the
great successses of 1978 in
Calcutta.

reality The Malayalam play,

Kiratham. is by G. Shanker
Pillai one of the most significant
Malayalam playwrights. Both
these plays are rendered
musically.

It is interesting to note that the
only play from Delhi is a
Kannada play Na Kri Sa's Nahi
Nahi Rakshati. ,It deals with
the life of Shankaracharya In a
most unusual way. This play
IS also perhaps the first major

play of the author. its
production is likely to have all
the inimitable charactertics

which we‘ have come to
The two Marathi plays belong to
two different types. Jaya
_ Dadkar's Kay Wattel Ta is a
musical satire which according
to discerning theatregoers
has been considered as the most
meaningful happening on
Marathi stage because of its
originality and freshness. The

other play, Aapla B'uwa Asa Aahe ५
is a light comedy distinguished
by very fine performances by ~

'
and Dileep Kulkarrni.

a play which was Sponsored
by Shri Ram Centre. In this
Festival he stages Uchek
Langmeidong; perhaps his first
attempt in writing. It deals with
a poetic theme, human bondage
and freedom. in a very unusual

musical form where the Langmeidong (the Birds) act as a»
