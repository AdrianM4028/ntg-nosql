competition. Show Must Go
On won first prizes in acting,

Uday Kala Kendra is the only
amateur institute to have cornpleted 25 years of unbroken
dedication to dramatic art in
Bombay. To crown its achievement the play Kay Wattel Te
produced in the Silver Jubilee
Year won the "Best Amateur
Play of the Year" award in
Bombay. This play also had the
honour of being staged in the
1977 Marathi Natyasammelan
held at Pune as the representative
of amateur experimental plays.

The institute has been organising
a one act play competition for

the amateur groups in South
Bombay for the last six years.
The main feature is that the
groups can stage their plays at
a very low cost. The make—up
is free, the expenses of lights for

the day are shared by the . participants of that day which make
the expenses lowest. The stage

property and sets are provided
free of cost in most of the cases.
The competition is organised with
complete cooperation of Murnbai
Marathi Sahitya Sangh.

of Maharashtra, further into
"Lokanatya (Vaga)". During
all these sequences there are
songs and scenes which are
based on well known songs and

sequences from old and new
Maharathi plays and National
folk lore (Abhanga and Ovya).

structure. This is a parody and a
very good one at that.
It has a scene where the political

leader tries to pacify his beloved
(kept) by singing songs from the
lmrnortal Marathi play Sangeet
Saubhedra although the leader
does not know singing, he
tries to impress his beloved by
his lip movements of singing
whereas in fact his secretary
sings the songs—a live playback
on stage. The use of songs of

love scenes between जापु-अन
Krishna and Rukrnini" for modern
love affairs in this fashion is a
grand flight of imagination.
The play is made up of different
scenes and events apparently
unconnected with each other
but developing a theme through
their undercurrent successfully
maintained throughout, a theme
of exploitation of people by a few
privileged ones.
