We hear many people talk about
their problems. The problems in
life depend upon how you treat
them. If you treat them unperturb, ed and lightly, they change their
face as problems—they are no
longer problems. Even, the
peculiar problem With most of
the people, that of passing time,
will also be no problem.

If one probes into one's own
है
mind, one realises that one's ego
is the root of most of the so—

called problems in life. One
should realise that every human
being possesses an ego of his
own. When egos clash

problems start. A simple method
found to get over such problems

is to understand and care a
little for the other's ego and you

realise there is no problem. In

this play Katdare has tried to
unfold this in a simple playful
manner by telling a commonplace story. A story of a boy
meeting a girl—Iove—marriage—

first two years of marriage—
later three to five years
caressing one's ego—misunderstand i ng—seperation—com ing
together and they live happily
thereafter. The presentation of
the production hides no secret
about the technicalities of
theatre, thus going closer to
the audience and taking them
into confidence regarding our
manipulations, revealing all,

tell them all, practically sitting
next to us—
This is how it is with me!
