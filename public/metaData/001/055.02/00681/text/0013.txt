N.S.ll. Intensive Theatre Workshop (Madurai)
About the Workshop :

The National School of Drama,
New Delhi has realised over its
ninteen years of experience that

the kind of theatre it envisages
has to be sustained and nurtured '
by the vitality inherent in our
culture. It is the decided opinion

of the school that its experience
should reach the small amateur
centres and the regional theatres.

The comprehensive three year
course of training in» dramatics‘
which it has been giving to about
30 students every year from
different parts of the country and
even a few from abroad has
convinced the school that a '
systematic programme is to be launched to bring about a healthy
synthesis of the folk tradition
and an awareness of contempo५ rary theatre will become a powerful art form with its roots dug in
to our soil.

The graduates who pass out of
the National School of Drama
have been working in different
parts of the country and have
been successful in creating an

awareness that only the emergence of a theatre of the soil
will ultimately sustain the
vitality of the theatre art and
make it meaningful.
To achieve this, a proper channel
of communication between the
y0ung theatre enthusiasts who,
in normal course, will not
get any chance of acquainting
themselves with the latest
technique or the necessary
ground material, and the vast
experience the school of Drama
has acquired over the last. nineteen years of its existence could
be created. This is a challenging
job, no doubt. Many young and
daring artists have shown by
their work in different parts of
the country that such a work
will have very clear possibilities
and would eventually usher the
emergence of the theatre, truly
national in all departments.
The Gandhigram Rural University
which has the unique distinction

of being the first village university
of India and its great record of
pioneering work in the field of
rural higher education and rural

reconstruction under its dynamic
Vice Chancellor, Dr. G. Ramachandran offered generous
cooperation for the project.

The workshop was inaugurated
on 1st November 1978 with

33 trainees, mostly from Tamil
Nadu and Kerala. There was one
trainee from Sri Lanka.
In addition to the two plays being
presented in this Festival the
.
trainees produced four improvised
productions by themselves. One
of these improvised plays, Yathra
is being presented as curtain-

raiser to the main Malayalam

A play based on
Panchali Sabadam by Subramania Bharathi.

Poet Subramania Bharathi
roused to action his fellowen
during the Freedom Movement.
visualised a social order devoid
of iniquities and oppression and a
society that will treat all as
'
equals. He was a passionate and
vocal spokesman of liberty from
all types of bondage. His kalvya,
Panchal i Sabadam typifies the
epitome of his poetry.
We do not try to enact the Maha—
bharat sequence here. You are
- better informed of it. Our aim here
is to view one eposide from it in
terms of the fundamental and
vital issues it raises in our contemporary social and political
life.
'

The story of the Pandavas losing
their wife Panchali in the senseless gambling of the eldest
brother of the Pandavas and the
subsequent insult Panchal i had
to face at the hands of Duryodhan does not confine itself to
the Mahabharata. This insensate
and mad gambling has its modern
equivalence in oUr contemporary
political, social and religious life.
