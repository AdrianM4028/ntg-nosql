and a stepmother Mama—Tombi.

Despite her stepmother's hostility, suppression and inhuman
treatment, Chaobi manages to

find solace in her beloved father.
Her heart, however, puts up a
passive resistance and her spirit
longs to wander far beyond this
drab human existence. A flock of
Uchek Langmeidongs (Langmeidong birds), in form of a Chorus
are the silent sympathisers of her

Th
Chaobi but society does not

accept that she should live apart
from her husband. There arise
questions of human rights, inner
dictates of the consience, social
commitments and their various
'
'
tedious demands.

Through various folk and classical devices employed the play
attempts to highlight the contemporary society where human
rights, woman’s emancipation,
exploitation and human sufferings remain imposing questions
without a solution. The Chorus of
the birds serves as a commentator
on the present human Situation,
its emptiness and cruelty, and
at its hopeless desire for something which can give a meaning
and purpose to our existence.
