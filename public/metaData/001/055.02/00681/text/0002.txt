National Theatre which came into
existence in 1948. The Indian
National Theatre was a creation
of Shrimati Sheila Bharat Ram.
Lala Shri Ram's daughter-in-Iaw,
Shrimati Kamla Devi Chattopadhyay and Shrimati Nanditta
Kriplani. They were keenly
devoted to the renaissance of
Indian culture and of taking it to
wider audiences because it is
only when art, in all its varied
forms, becomes an organic part
of a city’s life and activities that
it can flourish. To achieve this
there must be a meeting ground
for artist and audience, connoisseur and common man—where
an environment exists to learn,
teach, appreciate, create and
innovate.

Shri Ram Centre for Art and
Culture is carrying forward the
tradition of fostering Indian
music and drama begun by the

Indian National Theatre soon

after independence. The INT
pioneered a renewed interest not
only in the classical art—forrns,
