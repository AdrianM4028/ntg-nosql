ovations from all sections of the

The group was formed on Oct. 9.

being a mere 26. Seven months
after the foundation, which may
well be described as the period of

incubation, Sudrak launched
their first production on May 2,
1978 and won immediate

acclaim. I
In the eight months from May to
December 1978, they have had
twenty performances including
six invitation shows of the same
play Amitakshar in the leading
theatre houses of Calcutta and
in several districts of West
Bengal. The membership strength
of the team has grown from धु
seven to fifteen and it may not
be unreasonable to guess that
they have grown in confidence
as well. No guess, of course,
about the extension of their
artistic capability would be valid
as, for a proof of that, we will
have to. wait for their next
theatrical venture. And waiting
we are, eagerly.

Amitakshar literally means the
odd letter that stands out breaking the rigid symmetry of alphabetical arrangement. (It should
not be confused with another
Bengali word "amitakshar"

which was the name given by "
Michael Madhusudan Dutta to the
blank verse he used for his epic

Meghnad Badh Kavya?) l n the play
under purview the title suggests
symbolically the defiance shown

by an individual against regimen—
tation——social and psychological.
The protagonist of the play,
Twishampati (meaning the Lord
of Light or the Sun) is an ordinary _
man placed in an average lowermiddleclass milieu of poverty and
desperation. He. falls prey to a
sudden offer coming his way of
receiving a stipend of Rs. 200
per mdnth as an ex-freedom
fighter—and a bronze inscription ‘
(Tamrapatra) as well as a token
of honour from the Government
of India. All he has to do is to get
false certificates and papers in
support of his claim. The local
MP. belonging to the ruling party
recommends his case apparently
for nothing, but actually he had
intentions unknown to Twisham- ,
pat i .
The irony of the situation becomes

palpable when the assumed role
of an ex—freedom fighter starts
getting under the skin of
Twishampati. He starts reading
the history of lndian freedom
movement and starts telling
embarrassing truths about it in
several receptions and meetings.
He receives mild warnings but
he pays no heed.
' Then he goes a step further. He
starts criticizing publicly the
ugliness inherent in contemporary
politics. He lashes out against
the corruptions and rnalpractices
that he finds rampant all round
him. The local power clique,
comprising mastans, business
rnagnates and political leaders,
cannot overlook these gestures
from a man who had been placed
on the pedestal with their active
help only the other day. The whole
thing comes back upon them as
a boomerang. The threats do not
remain mild any longer. However.
before doing anything drastic,
they send a compromise formula.
Twishampati, well known by
now for his anti-establishment
attitudes, is to act as a double
agent, presiding over enquiry
commissions and passing verdicts
comfortable and convenient
for the ruling party. His public
image of being an honest patriot
IS thus to be exploited subtly;
