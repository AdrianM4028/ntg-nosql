ART & LIFE

l

Luigi Pirandello, one of the foremost innovators in the
contemporary theatre, fascinates the students and the
critics alike with his experiments with illusion and reality.
His contribution to the art of theatre has been that his plays
changed qualitatively the involvement of the audience.

The genesis of the play is found in a shortstory entitled
"THE TRAGEDY OF A CHARACTER"
The motivation of this play is essentially literary, as it runs
through various such considerations as: Is life stronger
t h a n a rt?

Does not the artist owe the reality of his art to the torment
and anguish which have gnawed the soul and the very flesh
of the mankind?

In 'Natakkar Ki Khoj Mein' Pirandello sends his message
across with the utmost clarity as the 'actors' fail to imitate
the real Characters he brings on stage while the playwright
is shown as unable to fix them without denying them the
life they live.

The presentation has a style which is very essential for
training of actors. By associating myself with the translator I
tried to discover the present day relevance of theatre
rnehtodology for actors training. The production has
incorporated several non-theatrical forms for effective
theatrical expression.
The main objective has been to explore the text of original Six
characters in search of an author, to fill in the blanks of time
and stage situation ; to search for deeper meanings and to
portray the development of characters, situations and events.
In this work reality has been stylished in an intimate manner
so that it can be grasped by those who are a witness to it. The
entire experiment has to be very subtle and sensitive and I
hope that every bit of the play will be enjoyed by one and all.
