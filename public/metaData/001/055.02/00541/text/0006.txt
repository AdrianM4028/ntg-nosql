ready to help them ﬁght oppression and resist all types
of exploitation. Haruheet is diﬁerent from other folk
ballads, prevalent in Kumaon and Garhwal, in the
sense that in this ballad the hero does not face any
physical threat or physical anihilation. It is his conons

overwhelmed by the respect and awe which the people
still have for Haruheet. They still believe that he is not
an ordinary mortal, but a God who constantly reminds

them of the ultimate punishment that one has to meet

Since we decided to perform the ballad in Hindi
this year, Shri Brijendra Lal Shah, who has written all

the scripts for all the previous productions of the
Kendra, was faced with a challenging task. He had to
retain the traditional elements of the ballad and
transform them into appropriate verses. i too had to
liberate music from local fetters though I have tried to
retain the original colour in most of the tunes. I have
also chosen such melody types (Ragas) which are closer
to the folk music traditions of that region. I may
stress here that this is the ninth eﬁort of the Kendra to
dramatise folk ballads of the Central Himalayan Region
in operatic form adapting them to Contemporary Indian
Theatre. I wish to express my deep gratitude to
Shri Subhash Udgata who readily agreed to direct this
play for the Parvatiya Kala Kendra.
