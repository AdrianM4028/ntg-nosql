Synopsis
Gujraon Kot is ruled by Sarnru Heet. His sons
born from his first wife become tyrants. They torture
people, exploit them, treating them as slaves. They
commit every conceivable crime on them. Suﬁocated
and suppressed the pe0p|e go to their village God
Goriya and curse the Heet family. As a result of this
black fever attacks the family killing Sarnru and all his
sons.

Haru, a son born to Sarnru by his second wife,

is quietly moved out of that cursed land by his mother
to her brother who rules in the low lands (Bhabar).
Haru is brought up in a different social setup. He
returns to his land Gujraon Kot as a young worrior
having a vision of social justice, equality and freedom.
His mother tells him about the woes of the pe0ple and
the liberties being taken by the minions of the administrators of the region (Thokdars and other landlords).

The news of Haru‘s return spreads among the
peOple. The pe0ple initially express their doubts about
his intentions. But Haru meets them, distributes the

land among them, sends his word to the Samants (Local
Lords) that they should not harbour any thought of

revolt, if they have any, and surrender. The Samants realise their position and hatch a consipiracy. They decide
to offer their sister or daughter in marriage to Haru. Haru
declines the offer. The insult enrages them and they
decide to provoke his Bhabies (Sisters-in-Lawl. They
poison their ears by telling them that Haru is intending

to make them his slaves by getting some poor village
girl as his wife. The Bhabies feel insulted and decide
to leave the palace. The Thokdar advises them not to
take such a decision in a hurry, rather, he tells them,
they should challenge him to prove his valour by bringing Malu, a famous beauty of the borders as his wife.

Haru accepts the challenge. He goes to the borders

The Bhabies change their tactics. When Haw
tells them to take charge of Malu, they readily agree-
