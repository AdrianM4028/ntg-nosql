Directorâ€™s Note
Everytime whenever there comes the
need of a director's note, i really feel embarrased, To my mind, the play, ultimately is the
real note prepared by the director and by the

team.

Yes, I can write about the team perhaps !
This time, this effort of mine is completely a
new experience as I had to create a musical
and that too with

a new team.

were very comfortable singing and that

me the idea they are enjoying too. So together
with the team we improvised along with the
thin structure of the ballad. But it had been
difficult as one's responsibility was to have
singing and acting. The

singing actors

demand more of a two dimen-

treatment but in theatre the actor
is a living being and has other dimensions
so far the space and interaction with other

actors are cOncerned.

Together we strived to

achieve this and that has been a major task.

By the time this note is going to the press
we are still evolving. So, I wish, this presentation would be a enjoyable thing for all of us as
we would certainly realize that the team would
