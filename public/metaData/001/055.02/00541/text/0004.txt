to bring his maternal uncles home for properly solemnising his marriage with Malu. But in his absence, the
Bhabies lay a trap. The river is in a flood. They invite

seen only in that river. Malu. in her innocence fails
a prey in their trap. They bring her to the bank and
throw her in the swollen river.
Haru returns and when he does not Ô¨Ånd Malu,
he asks his Bhabies, who inform him that she has gone

back to the Himalayas, as she did not Like Gujraon kot.
Haru is in deep distress. Malu's soul appears and
discloses everything that happened during his absence.

Haru is in a deep dilemma as to what he should

do ?
even though they had thought of marrying him. Should

executes all his Bhabies. Feeling he has no reason to
be in Gujraon Kote. Haru gives away the keys of his

treasury to his people, requesting them to look after his
mother and his horse, and kills himself.
