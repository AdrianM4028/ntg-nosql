ABOUT THE PLAY
Who will be out
Who will be in
When the time will call
And Inspection will begin.
The Mayor and his brigade are living a happy, peaceful and a crooked
life, but a sudden rumour shakes the system which leads to hilarious
consequences and the whole scenario is changed. It won't be a mirage of
laughter but it will turn out to be believe. Check out kind of 'JAANCH PARTAAL'
begins when siren of inspection starts ringing and shakes the entire system.
This Christmas SRC, l Ind yr Acting Course students presents JAANCH
PARTAAL , a dynamic humorous comedy based upon Gogol's An Inspector

General.
