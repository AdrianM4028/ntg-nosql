ABOUT THE PROCESS
Those stairs that led to the basement charged with music, dance and lines was no other place
but oMahagonnyp l

ltra not hard but practically impossible to pen down 40 days of rehearsals. But unle
ss I give
you a tasteof that, this brochure would be incomplete. So here I obeginp j
What 7 How? Why? u u ..was what we all reacted after reading the script. Da
ys went on a
calm looking director with a subtle smile of maturity enjoying the agitation of
these bubbling
actors did it all! We actually improvised the whole play in 7 days. This ag
itation turned into
excitement. Every scene had something for every actor, every music
had a rytham for every
voice, every dance had a step for every foot to tapp.

There was no chance for anyone to enter Mahagonny without giving
some part of themselves
to it. Yes, everything was definitely not flowery i we had ups and d
owns, tears and laughter,
shouts and smiles, rise and fall but fall was only to rise as we foll
owed the eyes behind those
spectacles which always said j DONn‘f GIVE UP.
I personally and on behalf of the whole team would like to
thank our director oMr. Suman
Kumar who not only supported but believed in his actors.

'Here I begin' was how I started I Here I endncannot be said so
all I would say lHere I pausern
for all to watch the culmination of these 40 days behind the cu
rtain.
