SYN
A tragedy in three acts by Federico Gracia Lorca, published
and produced in 1933 also presented as Bitter Oleander,
this is perhaps Lorca's best known play and the first of his
trilogy of "rural tragedies".
Blood wedding is full of rich and varied folk poetry,
symbolism and powerful elemental passions that victirnize
and doom everyone in the play. But these passions are
restrained by a stark ritualistic plot that bears only a
superficial resemblance to the sensational accounts that
inspired it.
Though suspicious of her son and his beloved, Gulnar
accepts Chirag's bride Shama because she loves her son
very much and wants to keep him happy. But the girl
(Shama) loved Suhail whose family had killed Gulnar's
husband and her other son in a blood feud. Suhail himself
innocent of the killings is now married to Shabnam the
brides cousin. Gulnar is obsessed with hatred for the killer
and his family. She agrees for the wedding as she yearns
for a descendent of her family, she tells her son "have as

many as you want as your father never lived to give them
to me".
Suhail is not happy with the marriage of Shama with Chirag
and reacts negatively towards his wife and her mother who

taunts him about his affairs with Shama. The bride also is
not happy with her marriage being fixed to Chirag and
refuses to be a part in the festivities, she still yearns for
Suhail who too cannot forget her.

On the day of the marriage when the guests arrive the first
one to arrive is Suhail who is extremely bitter about the
whole affair. Unable to forget each other the couple decide
to run away after the marriage.
