DARIO-FO, (1926)
Italian dramatist, actor, and theatrical activist. His career

began in small cabarets and theatres and in the Italian
national radio and television networks. In 1959, with his
wife Franca Rame, he founded the Compagnia Dario Fo—
F’ranca Hame, which produced a number of popular satirical

dramas including Archangels Don’t Play Pinball (Gli
arcangeli non giocano a flipper, 1959) and He Had
Two Pistols with White and Black Eyes (Aveva due
pistole con 9!] occhi bianchi e nerl, 1960). By performing
comic sketches on the television show Canzonisslma,
the pair became famous all over Italy; but when censorship
limited the couple’s artistic freedom, they formed another

theatrical pieces are written hurried/y and often depend upon improvisation
and extensive revision after each performance. Most recently his works
employ topics taken from current news—the rise of the Italian question—
