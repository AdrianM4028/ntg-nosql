DIRECTOR'S NOTE
I Start a few words about the production with respect to late B.V. Karanth who expired
on Ist Septemper, 2002.
"Kamloops Ki Machhliyan‚Äù is a black comedy of frustrated lives, unrealised dreams
and landing for change for the better or for the worse from one's present status in life.

an unexpected content to loin an ironic third meaning which is present neither in the
