About The Play
This play is about a common labour, Soopna, who has an innate tendency

to fanaticize about his situation. His fellow workers take advantage ofhis
naivete and ridicule his 'instinctive' Wisdom. He moves from one
situation to another without developing a more rigorous awareness ofhis
life. Yet, he does not die a fool's death.

Inspired by Lu Xun's 'The True Story ofAh—Q'. The play underlines the
class characters ofthe two forces operating in most parts ofrural India. In

attempt to emphasize how egalitarianisrn without a defined partisanship

is a myth, Soopna Ka Sapna places focus on the decadence of the ruling
clas s .
