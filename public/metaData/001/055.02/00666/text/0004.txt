WRITER’S NOTE
The plot develops around the conﬂict between two attitudes in religion, which
is the basis of the play. On the one hand, we know that religion teaches us

is oft
disharmony and divides the people. And this so often leads to tragic end as
shown in the play.
Some characters in the play are taken from real life, particularly the late
Nasir Kazmi, the well known poet of Pakistan, who features in the play in his
own name and with his own words. The dialogues that belong to NasirIKazmi,

are in fact taken from words attributed to him in the articles written about
him.

Ratan’s mother is at the centre of the play, but she is not alone. To her side
also belong Maulvi Saheb, Nasir Kazmi, Mirza Saheb and many others.
Despite the apparent difference their religion is in fact one.
It is a matter of great pleasure that a noted artist like Habib Tanvir is
directing the play.
