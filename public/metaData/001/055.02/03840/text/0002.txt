'Ihis outstanding Siberian Playwright who died tragically in the prime of his life,
left a deep imprint on the Soviet Drama. Varnpilov himself did not live to see the
ﬂowering of the Varnpilov theatre. It only blossomed after he was gone. However,
his inﬂuence continues still to grow.

The Chekhovian qualities of Varnpilov’s play have captivated theatre-goers both
in the Soviet Union as well as abroad. His subtle low — key dialogue, his haunting
developments, unpredictable and untraditional conclusions reveal the comedy and
the tragedy in seemingly commonplace happenings. As he digs deeply into the
inner world of his contemporaries, the psychological analysis deepend from play
to play, moral and ethical issues rose to greater heights as Varnpilov probes into
the ethical problems, people are contronted with today.
Vampilov’s plays are distinguished by sharp and dramatic collisions, highlighting
man’s moral degradation. However, his ﬁnal conclusion is genuinely optimistic,
revealing the playwrights deep faith in man’s humanness, goodness, beauty and
honour.
Varnpilov left us only ﬁve plays and a few short stories but the extraordinary
quality of his heritage has given an important place in the treasure - house of
contemporary Soviet Drama.
