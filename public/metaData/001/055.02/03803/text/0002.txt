language and displays different aspects of society in a comical manner. The
entirely different world of this play contains idle bureaucrats in Government
office, Businessmen who need license at any cost, Ministers going out for
elections and vote banks, Artists who confuse public with their modern art,
Musicians who are impressed & involved in their own music, Idle ladies who
adopt vulgarity in the name of beauty and fashion; everybody is seen in the
form of a comical character.
