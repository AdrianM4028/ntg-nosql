ABOUT T H E AUTHOR
Chekov, Anton Pavlovich (1860-1904) Russian writer, who
brought both the short story and the drama to new prominence in
. Russia and eventually in the western world. His plots are usually
simple, and the endings of both his stories and his plays tend towards
openness rather than finality. Chekov's works create the effect of
profound experience taking place beneath the surface in the ordinary
lives of unexceptional people.
_

The theatre has long fascinated Chekov, but the initial

productions of his first major plays failed. His first theatrical triumph
came in 1898 with the production of Seagull. Chekov died at a German
- resort die to tuberculosis.
