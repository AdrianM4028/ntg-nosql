are no longer prepared to celebrate.

Act IV shows Madame Ranevsky leaving the cherry orchard for the last
time. Lopakhin has bought champagne, but no one but the uppity servant
Yasha will drink it. Lopakhin and Trophirnof share a tender farewell: Trophirnof
will return to the university. Charlotte complains that she no longer has a
position; Ephikhodof has a new position with Lopakhin. Pishtchik is able to
pay off some of his debts. Gayef has a job at a bank, Barbara a position as a
housekeeper, and Yasha will stay on with Madame Ranevsky, who is returning
to France, Many characters try to confirm that Firs has been sent to the hospital.

Lopakhin misses his last chance with Barbara, and Dunyasha cries that Yasha
is leaving.
Madame Ranevsky and Gayef share a nostalgic moment alone before
- leaving on a relatively optimistic note. In the last moment, we hear axes cutting
down the orchard, and Firs stumbles on to stage, forgotten, locked in the
house. He lies down to rest and presumably dies.
