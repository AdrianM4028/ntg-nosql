THE PLAY
"The Lower Depths" was first performed at the Moscow Art Theatre on Dec. 18, 1902 and
then published in 1905. The play stems from Gorky's observations of life and his philosophical
seekings. It is knitted among the lives of a few tramps living in a dirty and congested basement
doss-house. The earliest version of the play was entitled "Without Sun'' the sun symbolizing
all the things of which the people "at the bottom" (the exact translation of the Russian title)
of life were deprived. In "The Lower Depths", Gorky weighs the two apparently contradictory

philosophies of Luka and Satin; on the scale of the dreams, hopes , emotions, and above all,
the life of the Actor. In an interview he gave in 1903 , Gorky said ; "The main question I
wanted to ask in my play was: What is better, compassion or the crude truth? What do we
have more need of? Does compassion serve any end if man begins resorting to comforting

illusions and lies to reconcile with life? This is not a subjective question: it is a question of
philosophical import. "The wanderer Luka, a nihilist preacher, shows these tramps a sweet
and pleaseant picture of life, possibilities and future in order to enable them to reconcile with
their pains and sufferings, To Lukaâ€™s philosophy is juxtaposed the romantic dream of a free
Man, with a capital 'M', proclaimed by Satin in his instructive and propagandist speech.
Gorky intentionally created this contrast in a setting of utmost extremety, showing people in
the most appalling circumstances; men who have lost all hope and have been driven to despair.
Will passive, compassionate humanism and consoling lies ever remedy their ills? Lets try and

find out all the answers in the play itself.
