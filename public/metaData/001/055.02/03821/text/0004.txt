SYN०PS I S
"Chekhov in my Life"-a love story is a memoir of Lydia Avilova's 10 year relationship with Anton Chekhov, from 1889 to 1899. Chekhov was 29, and this
period was an important part of his development as a Literary figure. The play is having an interesting Literary material referenced as new data about "
The Seagull" and a memorable account of opening night of it". Play witnessed failiure, and a great unacceptance, but Lydia got Chekhov's message in

the incident of 'Nina',‘ Trigorin' & ‘Mendolian'. Lines, engraved for Trigorin on Mendolian by Nina, meant - "It is improper young ladies to go to masked
ba | | s" .
It did convey the information that Chekhov had known all along that he was speaking to Lydia at the masked ball dance some time before. But it was
surely not the reply 'to many things' he had promised to give her in 'The Seagull'. Chekhov's real message to her seems to be contained in the unhappy

ending of Nina's‘ love affair that if a young girl's Iove could come to grief, then how could she, a mother of three children, expect a happier ending to their
love. It was Chekhov's typical way ofjustifying himself for refusing to accept Lydia's sacrifice.
"He knew everything : He understood every thing", Lydia herself repeatedly writes.
'Chekhov in my Life', transparently shows, through Lydia‘s eyes, the very personal life of 'Anton Chekhov', a renowned writer of Russia, who is very
famous in every nook & corner of the world for his great blessings in shape of his wonderful literature.
