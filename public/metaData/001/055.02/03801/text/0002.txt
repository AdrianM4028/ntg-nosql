Karna’s conflicts are interwoven with the stories of his mother, Kunti, the
wheels of destiny that governed his life, and how he held on to his honor
against all odds. The story is enhanced by meticulously crafted digital
imagery, choreography, music and martial art. The narrative ends with the
Pandavas’ discovery that in reality, Karna is their eldest brother; and their
consequent angst and tragedy at this discovery.
