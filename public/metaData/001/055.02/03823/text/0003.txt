DIRECTOR’S NOTE :
Theme ot the play "DAAKU" is contemporary. The ruler instead of solving the basic problems ol his
citizens play gimmicks to get popularity & tame. To get his goal he tortures & exploits poor people with the
help at his ministers etc.

The play tells the plight ot society, how poor & have-not people are compelled & torced by the authorities
to become bandits, whereas the real bandits & law breakers are enioying every comtort ot lite whether
they are in prison or living treely. They are protected & provided with every comtort by the rulers, ministers
& law makers, because these bandits serve their interests. It is also a commentary on present day situation

& problems.

The presentation at this play ’DAAKU” isin nautanki style. Other elements trom Bidesia and other tolk
torms are also used to communicate it more torcetully. The production has dances, songs, movements and
powertul drama . It will not only entertain the audience but also give some thought to think.
Motive behind this production ot "DAAKU" is not to revive the Nautanki style, but to use other elements
also to build a structure to make the play more interesting & meaninglul.
