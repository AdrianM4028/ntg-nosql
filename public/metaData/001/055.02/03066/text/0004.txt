Aboutlten years back I happened to see a Marathi version ofthis play on Marathi ८
commercial १ stage. The play had become quite a sensation due to it’s reaction
provoking comments on medical profession. Being basically an actress, I even had
an impulse to play the character of the lady doctor from the play.

Though the play did not offer you something that is experimental or innovative
as far as the craft is concerned, the sheer. genuineness of purpose and a good deal of
dramatic sense was able to capture my attention.
५Then came this offer from the Sri Ram Centre to do a production with them. And
my wish to be associated with this play got realised.

Ifa good play is all about making the audience THINK, FEEL AND REALISE, then this
play is What it is.
