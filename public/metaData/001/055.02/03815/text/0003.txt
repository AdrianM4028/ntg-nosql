DIRECTORS NOTE
This is a fun play about all Indians who love to talk , fantasise about sex,
but are pushed back into dreary reality because of deep rooted
inhibitions. The play looks at our double standards of morality in a
humorous manner. Though every character would love to indulge in an
extra-marital affair, they would not do it because since their childhood
they have been taught that sex is associated with something forbidden.
So, the grass is always greener on the other side. I think everyone will
identify with at least one character in the play. Though it talks about
SEX... It is a very, very "clean comedy", which can be enioyed with your
spouse, partner or a lover.
