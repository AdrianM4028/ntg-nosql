timeless and Universal.
To date the Kendra's production improves with, every show — not therefore

falling into the groove of blind faith but always remaining well above values
expected from it.

This year's Ramlila has interesting departures from previous ye'arS’

The search for the discerning of the divine and the profane, is an urge that lies

that divine space — the stage; which is a bridge between the visible and the
invisible, the consecrated and the ordinary. This inner revelation manifests itself
in the form of divine ecstasy in realization of a lotus-like Spiritual bloom.
