ANAMDAS KA POTHA
This play is based on Hazari Prasad Dwivedi’s novel of the same title. The novel is based
on the ﬁrst chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad titled Raikva-Akhyan. The play is the story
of a tattwasarshi rishi called Raikva, whose insatiable appetite for knowledge leads him
through many experiences and experiments in his life, all of which are scientiﬁc in approach
and which are reasoned and argued in an earnest attempt to understand the truth of the body,
mind and soul and their relationship with each other. But his days of contemplation come to
a halt when he meets Jabala the princess, the first woman in his life. He is impulsively drawn
towards Jabala, but fails to understand why. He falls in love and goes through intense
emotional upheavals. But this first ﬂush of enthusiasm soon gives way to deeper selfintrospection as he encounters more people from many different sections of society. The
second woman he meets is Ritarnbhara, in the form of mother, and the third woman in his life

is Rijukka as a sister. These interactions prove to be the predominant factor in inﬂuencing his
thoughts and making him realize the intellectual hypocrisy on the one hand and the inner
harsh reality on the other.
