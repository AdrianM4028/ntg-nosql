Help transform the lives of the
people of Shivarpatna Village
Kadambariâ€™s earlier project, Kutch Mahotsava in 2001, which was undertaken to rehabilitate
crafts persons from the earthquake-hit villages of Gujarat, brought into focus the need for
supporting crafts-rich villages and communities. Kadambari recognises the need to revive
craft forms such as these.
Thus was born the project to support the Stone crafts-persons of Sh ivarpatna in Kolar district
of Karnataka, about 55 kilometres from Bangalore. Kadambari has adopted this village to
revitalise this craft form.

Shivarpatna is a village having has 300 families struggling to sustain their traditional stone
carving skills in an environment that has become increasingly competitive. The younger
generation, traditionally the source of carrying forward the crafts forms, is slowly giving up
this means of livelihood as it does not offer hope of a viable and dignified lifestyle, and is
moving towards alternate employment avenues. Therefore, the craft form is languishing and
will die out if not nurtured.

Recognising this urgent need, Kadambari has decided to support this village, and particularly
its stone crafts-persons, to enable them to improve their living standards by helping make this
a viable profession for the younger generation, and by nurturing and keeping the craft-form
alive. it will also help improve the livelihood of the entire village.
