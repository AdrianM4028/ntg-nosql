This story is about the them who are not considered human
by the human community itself.
They are always surrounded by a sea of questions - Who ar
e they . . ., What are they . .., Why
are they ..., How are they ..., From where are they .... And so
on. No one has ever tried to
answer these questions. They are chased away, negated and
ridiculed, and shunned
by the rest of society. This play is an attempt to see them at cl
ose quarters, to go deep into
their lives, to feel their pain and sorrows and to explore the ma
ny hidden layers of their
consciousness and existence.
