Kad a m ba ri
Kadambari is a non—profit group that was formed in 1987
to foster and promote the Performing Arts and Crafts, and
help the disadvantaged improve their lives and have a
self-sustaining livelihood. The group aims at increasing
exposure, awareness and appreciation of the Arts and Crafts
and Indian culture, especially among children. Over these
eighteen years, Kadarnbari has evolved an integrated
teaching methodology to give this extended education a
new dimension.

Kadambari's work and its contributions are best understood
by the range of activities and performances that it has offered
the people of Bangalore over the years. It has helped enrich
the lives of many of the children who have experienced the
workshops conducted by Kadambari and who have received
acclaim and positive responses from audiences in the
performances staged by them. Kadambari’s concern and
intervention on behalf of the disadvantaged has been
appreciated by those whose lives it has helped to change.
