US CHEEZ KE EN AAMNE-SAAMNE
The play deals with incompatibility among couples — married or unmarried. Most couples
prefer to ignore this aspect of their lives under the pretext of protecting the sanctity of marriage
as an institution and other family values. The problem of incompatibility is one of the
complexities of modern life brought about by rapid socio—economic changes, and one is
bound to get provoked by it — consciously or sub-consciously. The play’s central character,
Supriya Batra, is young, independent and intellectual. She would rather comprehend the
problem of incompatibility for herself than just ignore it and give in to the situation.
The play does not attempt to suggest a solution - it simply presents the facets of this
widespread phenomenon, so that the audience can relate to the situation within the purview
of their own expectations and experiences.
