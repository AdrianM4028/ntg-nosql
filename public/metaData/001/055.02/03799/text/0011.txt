TAJ MAHAL KA TENDER
Taj Mahal ka Tender is a satire on the bureaucracy and the red-tape that drowns the ofﬁcials
throughout its rank and ﬁle. The play focuses on the organisational diseases that our country
suffers from - corruption, idleness, favouritism, arrogance and insensitivity to public needs.

The director has improvised the play by adding a couple of additional scenes to highlight the
frustration of the “real” intellectuals, the love and emotional side of individuals, and the impact

of ﬁlms on youth. The director has tried to incorporate a few poems of poet-dramatist Bertolt
Brecht in these scenes in an effort to drive home his point.
