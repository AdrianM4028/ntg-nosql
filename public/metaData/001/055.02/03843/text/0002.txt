This play was first performed in Dublin in l 907.

Play in a satire, a brilliantly successful comedy. We try to break the head of so
called father of Cruelty, but it reborn In the play, all the farcical elements
comment on the pathetic situations of the displaced societies are looking for a
legend to survive with dignity. The religion is not their solution. The father, the
care person is so irresponsible to their needs, brings a relation to home like an
obiect, dead to sense human needs and feelings. Father, the system to protect,
is ignorant to the dreams and desire of their children. Religion, overloads their
stale characters and episodes, which has no sense for them, so, a community,

living in an adverse situation, away from law defines heroism in a different style.
They fancy those, who break the law, social morals with violent actions. They
Adere those, who are dreadful and fear to law. They enioy living in a fantasy,
but they are not criminals. Hearing the deed of murder may be brave but
looking it happening before their eyes is a dreadful crime. 50, they decided to
hand over Ch risty to the law.
The idea behind choosing, "The Playboy of the western world" is to satisfy the
dramatic desire of students, to act with excitement. The play has grown up with
all the warmth and talent of the students. They executed the performance. |
