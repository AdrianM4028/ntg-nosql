About The Play
The play MEN WITHOUT SHADOWS (Original French
version: Morts sans sépu/ture) was written by the famous
French philosopher, novelist and playwright Jean Paul
Sartre in 1946. In this play, Sartre depicts the cruetly of
Frenchmen to other Frenchmen during the II World War,
7 by showing French Resistance fighters undergoing torture;
7 and it strongly reflects and represents his Existentialist
Theory.
As treated by Sartre, physical action, generally violent,
- takes on a new value in which his basic philosophy
consists in destroying the importance traditionally accorded
६३ to ‘motives’. The search for the psychological causality of
an act is either shown to be vain or replaced by an
investigation of the act’s significance. The characters in

the play frequently use the expression : “my act”,
7 emphasising the idea of it being both an outer object and
a reciprocal bond between man and what he does. The
play investigates the different relations of man to his acts,

whether he tries to rid himself of them or completely
assumes them. Without denying all the excuses that
ए फ्रं science gives for his behaviour, man is considered in the

perspective of the formula: “in any case, whatever I do, I
3 am the one who does” This existentialist play examines
a the ethical and political extensions of this formula; which
7 ' is the central point of the play.

7 In this play, Sartre tried to combine familiar speech with
३ ३ extreme conciseness of statement using ellipses, brusque

interruptions and a sort of inner tension in the phrases
which sets them apart from the easy going sound of
३ '३ everyday talk. Yet what really distinguishes ‘Men Without
३
Shadows’ from other “Philosophical theatre” is the
_ r absolutely dramatic and concrete nature of Sartre’s
' philosophy itself: The fundamental problem of the definition
of man and the world is truly embodied in living acts.
