ABOUT ACTING COURSE
To encourage young amateurs, the Shri Ram Centre for Performing
Arts conducts a two year part time training programme. The 1 st year is
devoted to in-depth study of all aspects of theatre and in the 2nd year
the basic theatre skills learnt are integrated into production on IndianClassical, Experimental, Western and Modern-Indian dramas. This helps

to prepare a professional team of actors to sustain the Hindi-theatre's
future. Students who complete the course with excellent grades are
