lktare Ki Aankh is not a
biographical play on the life of
Kabir but taking the times in
which Kabir lived it is an attempt
to bring out the inherent contradictions of our own times and
it focuses our attention on the
contemporary sickness. The most
characteristic quality of this play
is that it does not lose itself in
Kabir’s times but like Kabir's
relevance it transcends those
times.
