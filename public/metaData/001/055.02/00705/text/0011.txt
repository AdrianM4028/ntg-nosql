and takes him to the MarwariBasavanna-fair (MELA) of the
village.

lrya, a rich merchant of the
village, has to go to Bellary on

business. But before leaving, he
asks lrapakshi and Basavanta,
his younger brothers, to look
after the house-hold, and
Pararnma, an old widow, to look
after his young and beautiful
wife Ganga. Like Sangya and
Baalya, Paramma and Ganga also
go to the village fair.

At the temple. the PUJARI himself
is dazzled by Ganga's beauty.
Then what of Sangya? He falls
for her, and sends Baalya to
negotiate with her, on his behalf.
Ganga protests against the wild
and illicit proposition. Now,
Sangya, in his blind thirst for
love, seeks Paramma’s mediation.

The latter succeeds by using foul
means. Sangya and Ganga meet.
lll omens throng lrya's path, and
he comes back cancelling his
business-trip. The whole village
has become a den of -wild
rumours. He finds Ganga in the
company of Sangya in his own
home. The latter manages to
escape unhurt. Wild with anger,
lrya tries to kill his wife; but, his
younger brothers dissuade him

from murdering [a WOMAN._She
is sent to Bailawada, her native
place. All the brothers together
catch hold of Baalya, and ask
him to fetch Sangya. He declines
to honour their requests. They
threaten him, but he does not
budge. At last, they lure him, and
he yields, to the callous proposi—
tion of betraying his dearest

friend.
Then comes Nagpanchmi, the
religions festivals. Baalya prevails
upon Sangya to visit Ganga at
Bailawada, and offer her lovegifts and sweet—meets on the

auspicious occasion. On meeting
her, Ganga tells Sangya of
Baalya's treacherous deed, and

also of her own letter warning
him against coming there. (The
letter had not reached (him)
Sangya, unable and unwillinq to
distrust his dear friend, returns
to the village in the very company
of Baalya. The GHASTLY moment
comes. On the way home, in
accordance with their secret
designs, lrya and his brothers
surround Sangya, and butcher
him, much to their satisfactions.

Sangya—Baalya is, essentially a
rhythmic experience, of sound ,
and sight. It presents elemental
Man in his elemental COSmOS of
love, hatred, treachery and
revenge. That is why, without
explicit intellectual poses and
philosophical props, it goes
beyond itself with its primitive
charm and pristine purity. If the
passion—possessed humans of
the play remind you of Lorca,
and if its structural simplicity
and the gentle touch of fatal ism
remind you of Greek tragedies, it
shall not be a cause for wonder,
it is simply as it should be.
