The Thiruvarang dramatic troupe
was established in 1964. The
troupe was actively engaged in

the collection of folklore, legends,
songs, vaytharis (bols), etc. from
different parts of Kerala—eSpe- ‘
cially villages and tribal belts.
Experimental stage productions
were undertaken including the
staging of Th iranottam—a dance
drama on traditional lines
‘
incorporating thouryathrikom.
This was subsequently presented
by the Kerala Kalamandalam as
a Bharatanatyam ballet.
The maiden prOduction of the
troupe was a poetic drama called

Sakshi which was a social satire
written by Kevalam Narayana '
Panikkar. As one of the major
objectives of this troupe was to
revive our rich folk and classical
stage traditions, the troupe
produced and presented a
Kakkarisi Natakom at various
temple festivals throughout Kerala

during the years 1965-67. The
next three years were devoted to ’
the collecting and recording of

various folk items (Paniyar Kali,
. Pulluvan pattu, Panar pattu, Velan
Pattu, Vela Kali, Mudiyettyu,
Porrattu Ottam Thullal etc.) and
the study of their contribution to
the evolution of theatre in Kerala.
In 1971, the troupe presented at दृ
the drama festival sponsored by
the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka ३
Akademi a Malayalam version of
the classical Sanskrit Play Bhaga-

vadajju'kkom, the authOrship of
which is attributed to Bodhayana

of the 7th century AD. The first
play in which the possibilities of
the ‘native elements of rhythm
and movement were fully exploited by the troupe was produced
in 1973. This was Daivathar,
written by Kaval-am Narayana
Pannikkar and directed by Kumara

Varma. It had 40 stagings includ- '
ing the one sponsOred by the

All Kerala Sahitya Parishad Confe.
rence. In 1974 on behalf of the
Kerala Sahitya Akademi, the play
Thiruvazhithan, written by
Kavalam Narayana Pa nikkar and

directed by Alancheri Mony was
presented by the troupe at
Trivandrum, The age-old concept
of ThOUryatharikom (Geetha,
N ithra, and Vadya) implied in the
traditional Indian dramaturgy, is
the guiding principle behind the
stage productions of Th iruvarang.
it has concentrated on the
productions of plays by a judi। cious combination of the
indigenous folk as well as classical theatre practices. Avanavan
Katampa, first produced in 1976,
represents the latest stage in
the gradual progressiori of
Thruvarang's search for an
adequate theory and practice of
drama. The play has become
very popular with the Kerala
audience and it has already had

twenty stagings in different
parts of the State. The play is
directed by Sri G. Aravindan.

The latest of Th iruvarang’s
experimental productions is
Ottayan (The Lone Tusker) which
dramatizes an episode in the life
of Chakyar, a member of the
traditional caste of actors in
Kerala. It brings out the Natyadharmi concept implied in the.
Indian tradition of classical
dra maturgy.

During last year, Thiruvarang
presented Mahakavi Bhasa's
Sanskrit play, “Madhyama
Vyayog" at Ujjain in the Kalidasa
Samaroh.
'
The troupe, is also actively
engaged in research into the rich
native traditions of the music of
Kerala known as the Sopana
Sampradya. The troupe presents
programmes in this style with
the accompaniment of indigenous
percussion instruments like

Edakka, Maddalom etc.
