r Alwara llaku '०
symbol of power) the scramble
among politicians to capture this
chair, the emergence of Alwara
Daku from a local goonda into a
monster of wild proportions, and
.
how many other minor 'dakus'
like black—marketers, smugglers,
gambler and bootleggers join him ३
in ruling the roost.

The climax is reached when the
concubine, symbolic of a creature
of the evil system, finding that
her own people belonging to the
downtrodden classes are among
the worst victims of the
atrocities, revolts against Alwara
Daku. Realizing that the pol iticians sitting in their lofty seats
of power are unassailable, she
decides that the evil emanating
from them can be curbed only
by damaging their tools and ८
putting them out of action.
Waiting for an opportune moment
with calm deliberation she
confronts Alwara Daku, and he
collapses. . . .
