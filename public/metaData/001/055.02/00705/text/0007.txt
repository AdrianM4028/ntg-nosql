Kalakshetra Manipur which
was established on 19th July
1969 is on active experimental
theatre group of Manipur. All the
plays including short ones have
been well received by the theatrer
goers. The group has also shown
its plays in the cities of
Allahabad, Calcutta and New
Delhi and appreciation was
received from these places as
well. Shri H. Kanhailal Singh,
the main architect of this
experimental group, attempts
to adapt in many of the plays
the bare elements of the human
body for presentation of human
conflict and other complexities
of life. The group is also
apparently committed to
champion the cause of the
neglected and down trodden
and also the nationalist spirit.

Shri Singh was closely
associated with Shri Badal
Sircar of Calcutta and naturally
his impact is found in some
productions of the group. But in
their later plays, reliance on
traditional. forms of art has been
seen. The fabric of the present

play is indeed woven out of
tribal music and dance. Some
of the outstanding short plays
of Kalakshetra Manipur are
Tamna/ai, Kabu-Keiyoiba and Khomdon
Meiroubi. Of the longer plays are
Khu/ Amagi Wari, Faber and
.
Huranbagi lshei.

Laigee Machasigna literally
means ’ With the Children of God’.
The story relates to a group of
tribal people inhabiting in the
Mao area. Mao is in the North
of Manipur and is situated
on the highest hills of the State.
The people inhabiting there, as
other tribes, are simple and still

free from the clutches of modern
civilisation. To an outsider who
is never acquainted with the
people, it is really difficult to
understand and appreciate the
innocence and child-like

simplicity of them. Fear and

- misunderstanding stand as a
barrier between them and other
outsiders. But the barrier doesn't
stand stead fast. When one has
the occasion of mixing, living and
dining together with these
simple, people, before long under-

standing starts to grow up and
love is the gateway between
hearts. Gradually one starts

learning the real, nature of truth,
love and innocence, the natural
gifts of these people.
A teacher from the plains, born
and brought up in the environs of
a comparatively complex
civilisation has been to the high
region and gets himself
associated with these people,
their joys and sometimes their
grim struggle for existence.
Only then he can realise that
they are indeed the ’Children
of God'. However doubt still
persists in his mind if such
people and such a land shall
be subject to corruption and
meanness of the modern times.

It is not a fullfledged literary
drama. It is a theatre purely

indigenous in form created with
elements of tribal dance and
music of the Mac Nagas.
