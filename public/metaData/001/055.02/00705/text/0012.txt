A few former students of the

J.J. institute of applied Art,
Bombay came together five
years ago to establish this troupe
which has now grown into a
group of over forty professional

commercial artists devoted to
advancement of the amateur
Marathi stage. Shri Damu Kenkre,
the noted Marathi stage director,
has been the guiding spirit behind
them.
Nearly a hundred shows of a
dozen original one-act plays and
two full length dramas have been
staged by them. Apart from the
participating artists, all the
writers, directors, music
directors, musicians, stage
’
designers and technicians, are
non- professionals belonging to
the group with not a single
outsider.

Many of their productions have
won coveted awards in several

drama competitions, the most
prestigious being the second
prize in the Maharashtra State

Drama competition in 1978—1979
won by Alwara Daku of which
over 25 performances have been
given so far. Their latest produc- ‘
tion is a full length play ’Devaski'
a satire on oUr obsession with
religious rituals and godmen.

The impact and success of a play
depends as much on its presentation on the stage by the artists
as their ability to evoke audience
involvement: this has been the
motive behind the selection of
the themes and their presentations by the group, aptly named
'Ya Mandali Sadar Karu Ya’. . . .

This play is a satire on our pol itical system but is not directed
against any particular political
party or politician. One of the
banes of a parliamentary democracy is that unscrupalous
politicians can misuse their power

, to serve their own nefarious
ends. This is particularly evident
at the time of elections when the

baser elements in man like lust and greed are sought to be
exploited by the use of every
temptation including money,
wine and women. Not infrequ—
ently, the political parties enrol
local goondas on their side in
order to carry out their evil

designs to cajole, threaten,
intimidate and bribe the voters
and to disrupt the opposition by
arson and loot.
Alwara Daku is such a goonda
who is won over by the ruling

party, who besides being bribed
with money, is presented with a
concubine in the bargain, given
complete immunity against his
antisocial actions. Through the
medium of scenes enacted in

the streets, utilising the folk
idiom and folk arts, the story is
unfolded of the people enthusiastically constructing a chair (the
