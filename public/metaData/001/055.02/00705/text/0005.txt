The Madhyama Vyayoga is one
of the best short plays of
Mahakavi Bhasa. The Central

point of the Dramatic develop—

'I‘Madhyama" applied to Bhima

Sena (the Madhyama Pandava)
and to a Brahrnin boy. The
Brahmin, Kesava Dasa, his wife
and three sons pass through the
forest. Ghatotkacha born of

the distressed father clings to
the eldest son and the mother to
the yongest son out of special
affection. Therefore the second

son (Madhyama) offers to go with
Ghatotkacha. Ghatotkacha cal ls
out "Madhyama" Madhyama',
come soon".
Now Bhim Sena taking physical
exercise in the open air, hears
this cry and takes it for his own

name and proceeds to the spot.
The old Brahrn in prays for
Bhima's help. Bhima orders the
demon to let the boy go.
Ghatotkacha refuses to leave
him saying that he takes him in
obedience to his mother’s cornmand. When Bhima knows
that he is Hidimba's son, he
conceals his identity and offers himself as‘ the victim instead of
the brahrnin boy. Ghatotkacha
agrees. But Bhima instead of
following him, demands that he
may be taken by force, if he

could. Then there ensues a long
duel between the mighty father
and the mighty son. Finally
Ghatotkacha having failed to
defeat his opponent, requests
him to accompany him to his
mother. They all go to H idimba's
abode. Where it is revealed that
she ordered her son to capture a
human being with the intention
of meeting her husband, Bhima
praises Hidimba and embraces
and blesses his son. Bhima's
family accompanies the Brahrnin
family to resume their journey
peacefully.
