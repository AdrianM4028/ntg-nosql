In May 1978, the Centre conduct—
ed a discussion on the Concept
of National Theatre. About 20
eminent theatre persons from
various parts of the country
participated in this lively discus—
sion and put forward their views
and recommendation. Their
recommendations have been
circulated to theatre persons in
the country and various Governmental agencies.
The Centre has started organising
Literary meetings. Normally these
meetings are held once every
month. In this topics of literary
interests are discussed and
papers read.

The Shankarlal Murlidha'r Library
was opened last year by the
renowned poetess of India
Smt. Mahadevi Verma on 25th

the near future.

The success of the Shri Ram
Centre will depend not only on
the active participation of
performing artistes but largely
on an appreciative public. If we «
are to further the growth of our
.rich cultural heritage, there must

be an increasing awareness and
encouragement of it by more
people, who will, - with moral and
material support make” this
tremendous project a success.
We warmly invite and look
forward to your participation.

interesting to note that both the

from a large number of theatre

Written around 1900 the name of
the author is not known. The entire
play is in a song-dance form and
is directed by K.V. Subbanna who
perhaps is the only theatre
worker in the entire country who
has built a theatre in a remote
village and his actors and
audience are from the village!
though he does produce modern

workers and institutions from
all over the country in general
and from the participating groups

in particular.

Sanskrit is the only language
which is being represented for
the first time in the Festival and ०
befittineg we open the Festival
with a Sanskrit Classic, Mahakavi
Bhasa's Madhyama Vyayog.
Though Thiruvarang did participate in the Festival two years
ago but then it was with a
Malayalam play. Madhyama
Vyayog was first staged in the
Kalidas Festival in Ujjain a few V
months ago and the considered
opinion of the persons who have.
had the Opportunity of seeing
the play there is that perhaps
this is one of finest productions
of a Sanskrit classic in recent

memory.
For the first time also we are presenting a_l--lindi play from Madhya
Pradesh. lktare Ki Aankh is based
on the saint poet Kabir's life and
his times but only at the apparent
level. It does bring us face to face
with contemporary reality.

The Kannada play is a folk play.

Indian plays.
As it happens, we conclude the
Festival also with a classic of a
different genre. Agha Hashr
Kashmiri's Bilwa Mangal is a
classic of Parsi Theatre and it is
being produced in an updated
Parsi theatre style with all its
essential elements, music and
dance, being kept intact.
Five out of eight plays use a
great deal of traditional theatre
forms and four plays are explicitly
political. Perhaps this is indicate
of the present trends in Indian
Theatre.
I welcome you all to the Festival

and do wish that the time you
spend in theatre is worth spent.
For some it is always worth '
spent.

In the Festival the play from
Manipur was so impressive that
this year too, with great expectations, we are presenting another

group from Manipur. Laigee

Machasigna (Children of God).

boys and girl, mostly from J.J.
School of Art and Purushottam

This play also makes abundant
use of tribal dance and music
and therefore the language of
the play is not likely to be a
barrier.

From Calcutta comes Theatre
Commune with Prastuti. The
name of the group is indicative
enough of its leanings. Yes,
Prastuti is an intense political
experience.
There are two plays in Marathi
and the two represent two very
different types of theatre.
Suryasta is a highly successful

play of the professional Marathi
stage and Alwara Daku is one of
the most significant representatives of the experimental theatre.

Whereas in Suryasta renowed
actors of professional Marathi
stage like Dutta Bhat and Lalan
Sarang take part and the play is
written by a very successful
playwright with whom the Delhi
audience is familiar through his

Sandhya Chhaya; in Alwara Daku
