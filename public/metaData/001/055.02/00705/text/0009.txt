AlllllSllEK (Bombay)/Suryasta
Abhishek is a fairly recent
dramatic group f0unded by
Kamalakar Sarang, a veteran of
the Marathi Theatre, to produce
Marathi plays of selective taste.
In last three years of its existence, Abhishek produced four major .
plays: 'Dhandewaik’, ‘Jhakli Bai',
’Suryasta' and 'Aagantuk' which
were all acclaimed by the
theatre-gears and critics alike.

The notable feature of Abhishek’s
productions is that they all carry
a special stamp of Kamalakar
Sarang's aesthetic taste,
Kamalakar Sarang has been
active in the theatrical movement
right from 1955. He has produced
and directed for various
theatrical groups several plays
with distinction in the last
quarter of a century. However,
he and his wife Lalan Sarang
suddenly came in lime-light in
1972 when Vijay Tendulkar‘s

'Sakharam Binder' was staged.
Directed by Kamalakar Sarang
and with Lalan Sarang, in it,

‘Sakharam Binder' was a
tremendous sensation in all
respects. Its direction, acting
and production values proved to

be unique and model. The play was subsequently produced in

The play 'Suryasta' depicts the
present—day crisis of character
and values. It illustratively shows
how the lofty ideals so much
cherished during our freedom
struggle are gradually dis—
appearing from our social and
political life. The play is woven
around the towering figure——

Appaji. He is a Gandhian freedomfighter who believes in simplicity
and selfless service. He is
surrounded by corrupt politicians,
journalists and intellectuals who
are all greedy for power, money
and career. He finds the whole
surrounding terribly suffocating.
Even a young man like Gaekwad
who is an educated Harijan
becomes so much status-seeker
that he forgets the oppressed
members of h is' own class.
Appaji tries to kindle fire in him,
but fails. He finds all the men
of status using ugly methods to
acquire vulgar pleasures. Appaji
cannot breathe in this atmosphere
comfortably. His lone struggle,
then starts. At the end, the
crisis develops. Appaji fights
with all the might at his
command. But the organized
front of corrupt people overpower him. in the ultimate
struggle, Appaji who becomes
the symbol of all that is good is
destryed. Through this tragic
destruction the higher public
values are brought to the
awareness. 'Suryasta' was
adjudged by the top Marathi
Drama Critics as the best play

of the year 1978.
