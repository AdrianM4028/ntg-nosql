D I R ECTO R'5 NOTE
When is a house a home and when does it
become just a physical structure? The
characters in this story are unsure of
themselves-their identity, their own
contradictory feelings and responses. They
cannot empathize with each other and so there
is no room physically or psychologically for one
another in the home. They find personal
security in confronting and ganging up on one
another. It is a game to prove who is right, who
is better, who has given more and who has
given less-a game built on fear and insecurity,
not on love and sharing.
The play has evolved through a process of
improvisations and there is also a very
conscious effort to involve the spectator as a
“spect-actor” i.e. the spectator is invited to get
involved in the situation, to ask questions and
try and solve the problems the characters are

facing. This can throw light on the essential
problem and these inter-actions between the
actors and the audience become important
scenes of the drama.

The purpose of th is kind of drama is to allow the
children to express their feelings, ideas or even
question the validity of what they are seeing in
a safe environment where their responses will
not be put in .the context of right and wrong or
good and bad.
