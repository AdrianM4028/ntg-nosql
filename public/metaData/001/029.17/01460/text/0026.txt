to God, 1 will be very angry.‘ '
"1 do not care”
“So you are not my son from today! ’ ‘
“OK Dad! ’ ' said Sharm, and ran away.
He got a job and became a scientist. He
was very successful. All scientists were
trying to make a rocket to the moon and
were unsuccessful. Sharm also tried to do
this. At last, he was able to do it. There was
a special agent in it. There was so much
of koila in it that it could reach heaven. At
last he was sure that he will go.
Now he was in the sky. It was lovely. He
had already crossed all moons, and now
was going towards the Sun.
Suddenly he felt uncomfortable. We
came to know that-we were near the Sun.
We were going to Heaven. He crossed a lot
of stars.
He went into the Heaven. God said.
“Who are you to come near me?”
“Who are you to come near me?” said
Sharm .
A big thing came in and said, "1 am
GOD! ’ ’
“So you are the thing that took my
mother. You are the one who took away
my father. You love to do this. We are your
toys! ’ ’

GOD said, “This is my work, Son”
“What is your j ob, fool. To make people
cry. But why do you make the man cry.
You will do something to me in my next
life because I do not believe in you. You
have made me do this. Why don’t you
make everybody rich. . . . I know why.
Because then none will say OH! GOD. ’ ’
God was enjoying all this. He was finding all this funny. Sharm w as angry. God
said, “my son, you do not kr ow about this.
Let’s have fun. ' ’
"1 have not come here for having fun. I
will murder you. Do you understand. ’ '
“Do not be silly, have fun. Do you drink?
Sharm said, "1 do not drink.”
“Then what do you do, we will do that. ”
“I will not do anything with you.‘ ’
GOD said “OK” and went away.

.GOD was a well built man. He had lots
of mouths. Sharm had gone to kill him. He
had taken the most modern thing to kill
GOD. He was sure that he will kill him. He
was waiting for GOD. Sharm was thinking
that he “will kill God when God came back.
Sharm said that I will not leave you,
GOD was laughing.
“Do not think like that, you joke very
well. ’ ’
Sharm said "1 am not a joker, I will kill
you .
Now GOD was upset. Both were thinking to kill each other.

They were having a good fight. At last
Sharm, started moving back. GOD was
saying, ‘ ‘No. . . . no. . . ! ' ’ Sharm came to know
that there is some danger to GOD if he

moves back. So he kept moving back. At
last GOD cried “No. .. . .No
