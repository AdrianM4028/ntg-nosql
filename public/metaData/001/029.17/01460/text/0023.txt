AS THE
TEACHERS SAW
IT. . .
F
“Few people are capable of expressing
with equanimity opinions which differ
from the prejudices of their society”.
The obvious prejudice in this case is
against the handicapped. It is almost as if
our society cannot accept an individual
who does not mirror its own image—a
body with all limbs functioning and a closed inhibited mind. This mind which is
meant to be the descendent of one of the
oldest and most open
religious
philosophies. I am told a handicapped is
paying for his ‘karma’ . Not only am I
meant to believe this but accept it as the
reason behind their callous attitude
towards the handicapped.
So deep is this prejudice amongst us that
a mother of the most delightful child will
not be seen with her daughter and her cratches. She is ashamed—‘ ‘What will people
say?’ ’ Chowkidars at the railway rnusuem

laughed at some of the kids “What will
they understand? What do they know?’ ’
One child arrives in the morning crying,
more often than not, due to beating at
home. The other attempts suicide before

the age of 11 because as bright as he is, I
believe him to be genius, he doesn’t see his

future as bright. “People look at me and
laugh. The call me pagal I can’ t walk and

I drool. Who is going to pay me—a mad
man, a burden?’ ’
It was difficult to encourage him for he
was not far from the truth. He would
always be tainted not by his disability but

by ours. Our incapacity to accept him as
one of us—to be given the same equal
rights and opportunities. After all he does
not share our handicap—his is physical.
Surely education is not required to inculcate a feeling so wholly natural? Or are
we to give in to our selfish instincts cacconing ouselves in this soft shell away
from honesty and awareness.
We talk about the integration of diverse
cultures in our country the beauty of India. Is it to remain at this supupciall level?
The Sikhs have spoken up for themselves
but who will speak for these children?
