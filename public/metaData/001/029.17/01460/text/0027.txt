At last GOD was dead. It was a great
death.
We came to know . when a man has done
a lot of wrong on the Earth, he goes to
HELL. After sometime he comes out of
HELL, and goes to HEAVEN. There some
GOD who writes peoples’ lives. And when
all this has been done, there is a machine.
GOD puts him into it and the man

becomes a child and then it is sent to the
Earth.
When the GOD died, there was an ear-

thquake. Sharm put on all the buttons. At
last the quake stopped.
Sharm came back to earth. He was a

great man now, after doing the great
death. Now he was the GOD.

THE END

WE’LL ALWAYS BE ALONG
