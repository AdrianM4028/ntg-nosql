Since 1979, TAG has gradually but surely extended the bounds of its concerns, passing beyond a general preoccupation with children’s plays and theatre in education projects to a specialised interest in the usage of theatre as therapy with physically and
mentally handicapped persons.
FIRST REMEDIAL DRAMA TRAINING COURSE
A 9-month course beginning May 1983 was completed and succeeded in training 12

volunteers in the teaching of Remedial Drama. Several of them are already teaching
in institutions (see below) and will comprise the staff ofTAG’s Summer Theatre Camp
for normal and disabled children, in May/June 1984.

’I‘AG has also succeeded in establishing itself as a resource centre for organisations
dealing with the disabled, supplying not only specialist teachers but also the infrastructure to organise performances evolved out of pertinent themes—to more effectively raise
issues of concern and point out possible solutions.
