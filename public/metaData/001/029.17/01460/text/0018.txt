The play is not a crafted and ‘scripted
“Play” but rather a collage of inner and
outer experiences, of fantasy and fact,
drawn from the activities of the Summer
Theatre Camp organised by ’I‘AG’s
Remedial Drama Unit.
It is improvised (i.e. the children have

not learned a script by heart) in a way that
comes naturally to children in their play;
it has not been ‘rehearsed’ into stiff,

mechanical routines a form of regimentation beyond the capabilities of many of the
children. In fact it has been “rehearsed for
one week only.
A broad graph of the content of the play
is therefore the same as that of the 6-week
Camp: The major themes of concern are:
1. Animals and the natural world.
2. Primitive men and tribal life.
3. Modern Man: Creator and Destroyer.
4. Self.
5. Self and others (relations with parents,
teachers and friends)

6. Integration (of able and disabled; of
parents and children and teachers)

The reason for offering these experiences to the general public is the hope
that people will realize how ‘normal’ the
handicapped are and what benefits are to
be gained by all when this happens. And

to show that it is nothing that the average
teacher or parent could not come up with
in a school classroom or playground or
home.
