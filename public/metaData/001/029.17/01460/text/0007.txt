A key- set of exercises are based on improvisations by both individuals and
groups. By improvising roles. or by enacting life situations that t hey}, may have faced, or might face some. day, participants
find a way of coping with unfamiliar.
challenging or even frightening situations.
Role playing can lead to a better
understanding of other people and their
pedicaments. It can also help us perform
better the roles that we must all play in life.
The emphasis, is always on exploration,
creative self-expression and interaction.
Exercises. group games, mime, dance,
music, creative writing, artwork—all are
used to serve these ends. For the participants, drama becomes a way of learn-

ing, of creating and sharing.
METHODOLOGY

The sessions are conducted by trained
teachers. The ‘teachers’ do little ‘teaching’
as we know it; their prime function is to en-

courage the children to develop their own
interests. The teacher combines the roles
of guide, instructor and friend. His func:
tion is to programme the stimulus for the
group, so that the work is fruitful as well
as enjoyable.

Discussions are an important part of the
drama workshop. Exercises and games are
followed by in-depth discussions,
wherever necessary. The discussions do
not have to derive from the workshop
itself. They may centre around any subject
that an individual or the group may
desire—whether it be contemporary affairs, history, human problems, or
whatever else.
The workshop neet not be confined to indoor classroom sessions alone. The
children may be taken to the zoo, or an exhibition, or display, and use the experiences of the visit in the next session.
For it is not enough for the group to merely to itself, but also to the life and the world
around it.
