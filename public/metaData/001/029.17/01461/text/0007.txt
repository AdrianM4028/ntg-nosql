“Over and over I returned to the apparent truth that an absolute non-aggressive position seems unattainable with out tangible loss of warmth and cherish-

ible humanity (what warm man would spare the Ruffian With The Pistol
threatening his beloved) and yet a relative human' attitude which permits
retaliating under extreme provocation inescapably leads to horrors unenvisaged
and unintended at the start of it: ' witness Hiroshima as the end of the Second
World War.
—— Pete r Shaffer.

“l have an infinite faith in humanity and in its capacity to survive every disaster. Anyhow, that is a question of faith and it is a good thing to have faith.
Leaving faith aside for a moment, it is a little dangerous for the world’s destiny

to be governed by sudden and immediate reactions to events."
— J a w a h a r La | Nehru

“To my mind it is much better that we keep a gun for our protection than that
we—all of us, men, women, and children—go quaking and shivering in fear of
our lives all the time. It is better to frighten a thief away than to indulge in
futile mental violence against him."
— M .K . G a n d h i
