TH E PLAY'S LOCALES
The action of the play sweeps between : the Throne Room in Lear's Palace, a
room in the Earl of Gloucester's Castle, a room in the Duke of Albany's Palace, a
heath, a farmhouse adjoining Gloucesterâ€™s Castle, the French and British Camps
near Dover.

TIM E
The play is set in an Ancient Britain, ore-Christian and pagan; but we have
chosen to depict a medieval time, when society was feudal with a huge rift
between those who had and those who had not.
