A NOTE ON THE PLAY

EK AUR DURGHATNA is an adaptation of a contemporary ltalian play based on a true
incident following a bomb explosion in a bank in Milan which killed 16 people.

During

interrogation at police headquarters a suspect ﬂew out of the window—an act of suicide

according to the police.

Later, the trial concerning the Milan massacre resulted in three

fascists being imprisoned—and one of them turned out

to

be an agent for the Italian

secret police !

It was thus conﬁrmed that the instigators of the crime were the military and political institutions entrusted with the “protection” of the state, Ministers and Generals were

brought into ' court, condemned and then acquitted. It was only the criminal “labour force”
that went to prison, The case ended, as usual, in a great smokescreen; and the public
was led to believe, thanks .to the media,

that the massacre was the work of subversive

groups of the extreme left.

The play, therefore, is first and foremost an exercise in counter~information.

Based

on authentic documents, police reports and transcripts of various judges’ investigations,
it turns the logic and truth of the ‘facts’ on hand.

Rooted in tragedy, the play is a farce

—the farce of power.

So if you happen to laugh during the performance, remember that you are laughing
at real events—events which are criminal and obscene in their brutality,

more frequently day by day in the name of “law and order”.
