A NOTE ON THE PLAY

EK AUR DURGHATNA is an adaptation of a contemporary ltalian play based on a
true incident following a bomb explosion in a bank in Milan which killed 16 people.
During interrogation at police headquarters a suspect flew out of the window—an act
of suicide according to the police.

Later, the trial concerning the Milan massacre

resulted in three fascists being imprisoned—and one of them turned out to be an
agent for the Italian secret police!
It was thus conﬁrmed that the instigators of the crime were the military and
political institutions entrusted with the “protection” of the state. Ministers and Generals
were brought into court, condemned and then acquitted.

“labour force" that went to prison.

It was only the criminal

The case ended, as usual, in a great smoke-

screen; and the public was led to believe, thanks to the media, that the massacre was

the work of subversive groups of the extreme left.
The

play, therefore,

is ﬁrst and foremost an exercise in counter-inforrnation.

Based on authentic documents, police reports and transcripts of various iudges’
investigations, it turns the logic and truth of the ‘facts' on head.

Rooted in tragedy,

the play is a farce—the farce of power.

So if you happen to laugh during the performance, remember that you are laughing

at real events—events which are criminal and obscene in their brutality, and which
occur more frequently day by day in the name of “law and order".
