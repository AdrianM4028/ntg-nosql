and what the destination—the objective of the revolution—is,
and ways to get there :

how to make the revolution, to bring it into being, and what to
do when we have it, and how to carry it further,
The revolutionary artist will seek ways to drench the people in

such beauty that they tear down the flags and subvert the armies,
form communes and cells and a society in which there is a

possibility of being.
Because bourgeois society doesn’t tell the people what beauty is.

The secrets have been appropriated by the rich with their
exclusive education and avidity, and the peeple are poisoned
by the mercury in the mass media.
The working people are going to take over the means of production,
occupy the places of industry and turn them all into factories

of food clothing shelter heat love and the extended mind.
It is going to happen.

And we are going to do this by exercising all violence. and the cause
of violence, the need for violence, violence in all its forms,
violence of hands, teeth, bombs, police, army, state, law, land,
moral and sexual.

This is the work of the world.

And this work of the world is the only work of the theatre ........ .. ...
