A letter from FAZ
Dear boys and girls of Delhi,
When the Taj Palace Hotel first
suggested that some of my amazing
adventures should be made into a play,
I was doubtful if it could be done. But
gradually, as TAG began rehearsing the
play called OLD KING COLE, with
me, FAZ, as the Ô¨Åendish hero,

my

attitute changed from doubt to delight.
TAG has not only succeeded beyond my
wildest dreams, they have created a
masterpiece. OLD KING COLE will
surely take its place on the shelf of
Golden Literature, some where between

King Lear and Spiderman.
Do come and, see us after the show

and have a thrilling time experiencing
the play.

Yours fiendishly,

F
