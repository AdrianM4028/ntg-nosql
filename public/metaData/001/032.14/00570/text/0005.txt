HATHAT NAWAB
( Produced by SILPAYAN )

SY N O PS l S
Jurdan Khan is an upstart. He wants to elevate himself to the upper class by cutting
off all the previous connections. As such. morality and humanity lost all meaning to him.
Even his wife could not restrain him. His only daughter Roshni is deeply in love with
Khelat.

But Jurdan is reluctant to solemnise the marriage only because Khelat is not a rich

man. In order to imitate the bahaviour and gimmicks of the rich, Jurdan took recourse of
some people of socalled upper strata for training. One of them ignites hope in him to introduce him to the royal palace. Prospect of marrying a beautiful widow of upper class family
made Jurdan almost mad.

But in the long run that friend of Jurdan himself marries that lady

utilising the money given by Jurdan.

Meanwhile, Khelat taking the disguise of Shahajada

made Jurdan give consent to marry her daughter with Khelat.

After going through a series of

events Jurdan at last ﬁnds his proper place in his own familiar social strata.
It is a play adapted by Shri Jyotirindra Nath Tagore from a comedy of Molier.
