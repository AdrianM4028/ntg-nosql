Rome, 44 B. C. A misapprehension crept into the mind of JULIUS CAESAR during
the second week of March, that he might not see this month peacefully out.

In anxious discernment did he realise the degree of his delineation from the people ;
the very same people that were once his die-hard supporters.

Caesar could not be less certain of his power as then and had siphoned offa large
portion of his wealth abroad, the details of which came to be known to the Senators not
much later.

The traders had lost faith in his foresight, the Senators in his leadership and the
populace in his goodwill.
A smell of revolt was in the air.

Brutus and Cassius conspired the scheme to which

was added the ever fertile cerebration of that peerless intriguer, Cleopatra.

She aimed at the emancipation of Egypt from the yoke of Caesar’s tyranny.

Caesar

grew increasingly nervous and also suspicious of even his friends and loyal followers In his
attempt to turn the table on the opposition he tried to revive-the previous administrationsystem that possessed, at least, a Veneer of Democracy.
But this his attempt too, degenerated into a vicious scheme of perpetuating dynastic

dictatorship through the choice of his adopted. son, Octavious as his heir and successor.

Thus and then came the IDES OF MARCH to be etched on history with the grand
and gruesome murder of JuliusCaesar in the Senate at the hands of his friends

Recurring repeatation of this magniﬁcient assassination on diverse socio—political stages
is the rremiSe that lends dramatic as well as historical validity to THE LAS ‘
