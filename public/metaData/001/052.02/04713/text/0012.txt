About the Play
'he Giving Tree is a simple story about a boy
and his friend the Tree, they often meet as the
boy grows up, the needs of the boy strip the
tree of its own body.

Two friendsâ€”one always giving, the other always
taking. A tree that gives its shade, fruit, branches, and
finally its trunk to make a little boy happy.
Our play 'Mera Dost' is based on the main theme,
though branching out into the reality of today, school
life, a busy home and the ever growing needs and
wants of a young urban boy.

Ambition and greed take over and eventually the boy
returns to where he started, realizing that money and
power are not the only things in the world, more
important being peace of mind and love.
