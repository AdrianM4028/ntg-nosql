About the Author
hel Silverstein, born in 1930 in Chicago, where he
started writing from the time when he was a
young boy. He was a composer, an artist, and the
author of numerous books of prose and poetry for
younger readers. His prose works include such modern

classics like — The Giving Tree (1963), Lafcadio: The
Lion Who Shot Back (1963), and the Missing Piece

(1976), while among his immensely popular poetry
collections are—Where the Sidewalk Ends, A Light in
the Attic, and, most recently, Falling Up (l 9%). The
Giving Tree is one of his earliest and most successful
books, was rejected by an editor who felt that the
book fell between adults“ and children's literature and
would never sell. Later, both adults and children
embraced the book. Silverstein's work, which he

illustrated himself, is characterized by a deft mixing of
the sly and the serious, the macabre and the
just plain silly. His wicked, giddy
humor is beloved by

countless adults as well as
by children. He won
३ awards for all his three
books: The Michigan
Young Readers Award

for Where the Sidewalk
Ends, School Library
Journal Best Books
Award for A Light in
the Attic, an
international Reading
Association's Children's
Choices Award for The Missing
Piece. He died in May 1999.
