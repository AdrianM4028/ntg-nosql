Director's Note
or many years i have been conducting simple
puppetry and object animation workshops at the

NSD, which normally conclude in a students
presentation. in l 997, one such workshop with a

second year batch of students culminated in a
production of Vijay Tendulkar's Cycle Walla using the
medium of puppet theatre to project different planes of

emotion and story.
it has been my endeavour to relate different forms of
performing arts which sometimes get isolated into very

definite compartments—acting, music, dance, masks,
puppetry—into an expressive whole.

The power that the actor holds cannot be compared
with the capability of the puppet, and vice versa, the
stylized and objective power of the seemingly dead
puppet can never be equated with that of the human
being. Both must compliment each other in saying

different things, at the same time giving myriad
perspective to ideas and thoughts. All are eventually a
means in our hands to project the essence of our
creative impulses without becoming an end in
themselves.

l was introduced to the story of The Giving Tree in
the early eighties by a performance of the Theatre of
the Deafs (U.S.A.) tour to Delhi. it has stayed with me
ever since, the simplicity and the directness of Shel

Silverstien's story The Giving Tree is most complete in
its visual scenography, and yet it offers us many
interpretations around the theme, both for adults and
children. Above all it affords the use of puppetry in a

different dimension, speaking about the inner and
outer voices we carry with us - the puppet, the
puppeteer and the actor.

\X/eaving a play around the story of the little boy and
the tree, the credit goes to the whole T l . E. team, who
have improvised the text through situations given to
them — the harsh reality of schools and home, to flights
of fantasy of the puppet or our selves...
