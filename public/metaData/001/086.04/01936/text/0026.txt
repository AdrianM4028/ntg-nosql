lizm in terms of language, plot, characterization, sounds etc., coupled with "
elements from the presentational style, i;
and it is this intricately woven combined:

stylistic form which we have exploited?
in the present production. We have ३
extended the use of folk convetions by दृ
the addition of a 6 member Chorus, which

is an extention of the Sutradhar. The
Chorus, speaks on behalf of the characters
and at times even the stage directions.
It becomes an ever present dramatic
persona who comments on, and aids in
the objectifying of strong emotions.

Music of a dissonant and discordant
nature is used not to high-light dramatic
climaxes, but by its very nature expresses the discordance present in the lives
of the people. The music has been integrated into the sound pattern so that its
point of take off arises from either the
tone of the human voices or of objects. ‘
At times it elongates and exaggeratesr
realistic

ernetions

in

terms

of pure .

sounds.

Our attempt has been to juxtapose
highly realistic acting with elements of a
presentational style in order to bring
into sharper focus the theme, which
deals with the insoluable predicament

of the middle class, caught in its own:‘
self-deciet
and
W, Hweb of hypocrisy
and thereby refusal to face its own.
