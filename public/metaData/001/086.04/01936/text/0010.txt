In BM. Shah’s direction the Little-l"
Theatre Group has lobbed yet another
sure shot Mashriqi hoor, a traditional
Parsi style play by Pandit Radhe Shyam
Kathawachak, staged by the L.T.G.
Repertory is a bagful of fun. The play is
part of the National awakening movement
of the forties when revivalism was in
vogue. It is ostensibly an attack on a
Iicentious ruler in the grip of a scheming
minister who for petty personal gains
rids the king of faithful ministers and
digs a deep moat of distrust between the
ruler and the ruled. In effect the story is
of a faithful nationalist’s success against
insidious foreign influences on a basically

simple people.
B.M. Shah maintains the Parsi style
of presentation quite effectively. The
declarnatory mode, the mock-heroic
delivery and expansive acting create the
proper distance between
and the idea.
