ADH E ADH U RE

The remarkable in ADHE ADHURE
is that the playwright has a fine sense of
the language of the theatre. Mohan Rakesh
broke new grounds in the extention of
the visual and auditory medium of which
theatre is composed. Gone was the reliance on pure literature, which in attempting to scale dramatic heights, broke into
poetry and lyrical abstraction. lnstead
what emerged in Adhe Adhure was reality
captured in all its shimmering and ef'fervescent quality. An intangible reality one
which refuses to be deﬁned and f'ormulated, but one which excites by its mysterious ever-changing quality . This elusive
quality of reality forms not only part
of the theme of Adhe Adhure but can be
seen in the very use of language. Thus
the content and form merge together to
create what is now considered a major
classic of modern dramatic writing.
With Adhe Adhure, Mohan Rakesh
expanded the scope of dramatic writing

in a number of directions. To mention
a few he attempted to create dramatic
tensions in a seemingly mundane and not
overtly dramatic plot. Here tensions are
created through a language that is free
from highly charged words—it is a
spontaneous language which we use every
day, but one which contains within it the
evocative hesitancy of unspoken emotions,

which without being obviously poetic,
reaches lyrical heights.
