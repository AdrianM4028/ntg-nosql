In this play- we see two ageing souls meeting each
other by chance in the evening of their life and
combining to find a brighter, happier future for
themselves.

Baburao is a widower. His son Sanja is settled in
Bombay. Baburao has been living a retired life in
Nagpur but comes to Bombay on his
son's marriage. Megha Kulkarni plays Sanja’s girlfriend and eventually his bride. ॰
It is here that Baburao chances to meet his
childhood friend Durgi, a widow now fallen on
somewhat reduced circumstances. The old
connection gets gradually enlivened. The two old
souls begin to see the rainbow in the sky. They
decide boldly to get married and thus revive their
feelings for each other on the marital level. The son

opposes but. only for the time being.
Among the incidental characters Mohandas
Sukht’nankar plays a prying old friend of Baburao's.
Similar minor personages are treated in a comic
vein. The main plot, of course, is full of delicate
romantic feelings and a warm human touch.
