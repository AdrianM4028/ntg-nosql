Charu, daughter of Colonel Raje gets fits of madness
from time to time Her father feels that she may
strike up a liaison with their chauffeur Already a very
strict and sadistic nurse looks after her But the
colonel wants a male companion to put Charu on a
positive track. He therefore advertises for a so-called
"private secretary". When the young man
is appointed, the Colonel tells him the real purpose
of this. “Try to give her all that a man can
give a woman," he instructs Pradeep. In order to
save face the father also tells his secretary that
Charu is not really his daughter but that she was
born to his wife from the husband of the nurse
It is here that the dramatic conflict of the play
begins to take shape. Matters are complicated
because Pradeep already has a girl-friend;
He stands between two stools—his love
for Sumitra, his original friend, on the one hand
and, on the other, the psychiatric duty he has been
asked to perform towards Charu.
Pradeep does give Charu simple affection and thus
encourages her to change for the better. Charu
becomes more self-reliant. On the father’s part, he
is asked to give Charu more genuine love. Charu
stops being scared of the nurse.

The end comes when the colonel dies of a heart
attack. Pradeep Joins his lover Surnitra and Leelabai
