Maharashtra Information Centre
New Delhi
Hearty welcome to you, ladies and gentlemen, at
the inauguration of the 91 st annuai Marathi drama
festival of Maharashtra information Centre. As you are
by now aware, the Centre has been arranging a 4day drama festival starting from 5th November every
year. The day has a special significance in the
cultural tradition of Maharashtra for it was on this
day in 1843 when the first Marathi drama 'Seeta
Swayamvar' was staged by Vishnudas Bhave at
Sangli. To commemorate the event, 5th November
is celebrated all over Maharashtra as Marathi
Rangbhoomi Din. For Maharashtra information
Centre, it provides a good opportunity to acquaint
the theatre-lovers in the north with the new

developments in the Marathi theatre.
To avoid the overlapping of our function with
Diwali festival, we have shifted this programme for
Ocotber 98th to November 1 st. This year we are
presenting the Goa Hindu Association of Bombay
with 'Durgi', ‘Mantarleli Chaitravel', and ’Abhaiache
Rang'; the three famous Marathi playsRangabhoomi
Din will be celebrated on 1 st November 1983 by
presenting a Hindi play, Lok Katha-78, by Rangayan,
Bhopal.
