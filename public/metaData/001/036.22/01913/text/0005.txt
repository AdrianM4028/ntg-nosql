By a strange coincidence this play also deals with
the dilemma of an adolescent girl and her

relationship with a disciplinarian father (and her
docile mother). Pralhad Dabholkar is
a successful businessman who has little time for his
family, especially for his daughter lra.
His wife IS engrossed in so-cal led social work. Between
the two lra is neglected and tries to defy them with
easily found boy friends and, worse, drugs. The
play is mainly about Ira and the manner in which

she is weaned away from her destructive ways,
essentially through revived parental affection.
