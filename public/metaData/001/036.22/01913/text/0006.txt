Lok Katha-78 is not a play by a conservative View
point. This is a truth in itself. This is a document
comprehending the contemporary ethics Lok
Katha-78 is not a story but a pertinent question
This is a question to you and all of us.
The question is of justice, of paying 'costs‘ on

raising a voice against lfTJUStICC This question is of
class difference, monetary difference, of the ordinary
and elite, of the poor and rich and of exploiter
and the exploited.

This play is just an objective reality and a question
is "originated from it—And the answer, you yourself
have to seek.
