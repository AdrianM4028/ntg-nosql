PAPA SANGA KUNACHE :
(Suresh Khare)
A farce. But one with a purpose. No
one is above blemishes, much as one likes to
believe he is. The devil-may-care type may
express them while hypocrites may try to
suppress them. Papa — a nice man, as good
a husband as a person can be and a well-todo father of two children.
As the chance
would have it, he developes friendship with
Priya, a divorcee. The friendship ends up

in an intimacy of the sort forcing Papa to
divide his week equally for spending in the
two houses. Papa is blissfully unaware of
the leakage of his ‘secret' which has by now
disrupted the peace in family.
But he

couldn’t care less.

Hell-for-leather he goes

to the other house. But things don't end
there and here begins the merry-go-round.
