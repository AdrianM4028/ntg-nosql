II NTIE IRVA IL

Scene IV

Urmila is the image of the ideal woman. But under the silent calm brews a great tempest which time
and again materialises as the second Urmila. She is that part of the woman suppressed by traditions
in a male dominated society. She is the voice of innumerable women struggling for an identity.
Urmila accepts to be a part of the palace, an insignificant pillar, she cannot gainsay the decision of
her husband, but her inner self ~ the practical, questioning suppressed world of Urmila ~ cannot
accept it.
The conﬂict between interval voice of Urmila and the conventional continues

~
-

Why should she stay behind when Sita can accompany Ram?
Why should she renounce her identity?
Is she just a pillar of the palace, a drop in the ocean?
Is she destined to weep and wail?
Is her life one of dedication, submission, and sighs?

Scene V
On the other hand, Bharat refuses the throne and waits for Shri Ram’s return from exile.

He renounces princehood and finds peace by adoring the sandals of Ram.
Urmila, in her dream, lends her voice to the rebellious Urmila who questions the decision taken to
leave her deserted.

In exile Sita is abducted by Rawan. Ram and Laksman travel far and wide to release Sita from the
grips of evil.

Scene VI

Finally Ram, Sita, Laksman return after their 14 years of exile. Urmila has doubts about herself. Is
she physically as attractive as she was fourteen years ago? Will the beauty of the face affect the
beauty of her love?
