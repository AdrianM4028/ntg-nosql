Scene I

The play opens with the coming of Ram, Laksman and other kings and princes in )anakpur where the
“Swayamvar” (the selection of a bridegroom) for the Princess Sita is to take place. On the way, Ram
and Laksman come across Sita and her sister Urmila who are coming back after offering their prayers
to Gauri, .God Shiva’s spouse. It is love at first sight and Ram having stringed the great bow of Shiva
wins Sita as his bride and Laksman weds Urmila. A first indication of the dual character of Urmila is
given when the alter ego of Urmila materialises and warns her of the impending difficult momentsof
this union. Both couples return to Ayodhya where Ram has been declared heir to the throne.

Scene 11

Under the misguidance of Manthra, her confidante, Queen Kaikeyi forces King Dasrath to place her
son Bharat on the throne and banish Ram to the forests for fourteen years. Sita insists on
accompanying Ram. Laksman who worships his elder brother opts for self-banishment and follows
Ram, leaving Urmila behind.

Scene III

The great conflict of emotions and values starts. Urmila pinned down by traditions and customs
suffers in silence, sometimes seeking refuge in her paintings, among the objects that remind her of

moments of joy with Laksman and constantly and dutifully serving her mothers~in~law. She
renounces all worldly pleasures and adopts the life of an ascetic. However nothing can fill the void
left by Laksman.
