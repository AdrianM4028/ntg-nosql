would have gone through. Thus one of the purposes of this workshop was accornpalished, Indeed. We
have taken small steps in making the younger generation aware of the tragedy of the partition.
Consequently making them value both the countries. A journey - | 947, was conceived without a script
through improvisations, based on real stories of our elders. The play consists of more than 40 poems.
originating from both India and Pakistan. with theatre students from both sides of the border taking
part. These real stories show the plight and suffering of the people during the ardous journey of
partition.

The play does not try to rub salt into the wounds of partition, but rather attempts to heal them,
to change the thorney wires of hatred into soft lines of love. We hope the viewers, especially the young
ones, will be enlightened, learn from our past and look towards a bright and loving future.
