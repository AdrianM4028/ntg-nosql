Socially distorted unfortunates will have to take some potent steps themselves in order to ameliorate and transfbrm their
sad lot. When out society endeavors to make improvements in their traditional thinking concept then and only then, these
unfortunates will have a sigh of relief by enjoying the freedom of though and will also get emancipation of narrow-mindedness of
society.

The questions is aroused in the play, whether the time of Umrao Jaan has passed or it has been shifted from prostitute
house to bar house.
