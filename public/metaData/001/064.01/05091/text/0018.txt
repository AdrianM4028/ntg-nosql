A journey to an iIIusive paradise
Kewal Dhaliwal

वॉली त्तउठ खीं aw घडी भी
'Gadi Charhan Di Kahal Bari Si' is based upon four significant short stories of Punjabi viz 'SUKH
Dl GHARI' (Baldev Singh Dhindsa) PAl LAN PAUN DA SAP (Dr. Jaswinder Singh) Ram Gau
(Harpreet Sekha). GALAT AU RAT (VeenaVerma) and Poetry (Surj it Patar).
It is a combination of poetry and short stories. These stories tell the tales of those young
boys and girls who do everything. Possible or impossible to the green pastures of the western
world. The stories are a poignant description of the dreadful lives of what we call, illegal
immigrants of their conditions of unemployment and of the now irresovable criser of our Debt.
Ridden peasantry. There at hours which compel them to leave their country. Behind But
ironically they never reach their paradise of their imagination. Rather another life of exploition,
inhuman conditions of living and fugitive existence. Which awaits them there. Again its is the
woman who suffer the most under these conditions. This play is the narration of the dreams
never getting realized and ofthe desires never reaching their fulfilment.
