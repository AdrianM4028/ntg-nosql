Directed by:

We have Collected three Literary master works, John Irwin's play "Progress".
'Taufiq-Ul-Haqeem's play "Song of Death" and Maxim Gorkey's short story "Gaddar Di—
Maa" and these works were interwoven into our play 'Maawan". There another give us
three different shades of the same essence thease are the syrnboles of million of those
mothers from whom their innocence has been struck away so brutally that encirnity of
generation come to be their tradition, their honour, with the result that they were
among their enemies, against their own selves.
In this production, where as story takes turn at very crucial points, acting style
also changes along with modes of production. To make it more powerful Dr.
Shaharyaar has given a few songs. We are comm i ng close to the model of folk theatre.

solgans of victory are shouted, a great yug is going on, the celeberations of ecstasy are also being enjoyed with great pump and show.
Yudehistra is giving away alrns to the priest after the prayer. The great
priest, charwak along with his son Trilochan came home. But the wife of
Charwak, Sarswati ask her husband to stop the solgans and celebrations
of victory because numerous innocent people were assassinated in the
battle ﬁeld. The brothers, and Gurus were put to death in this battle. It
was the battle against humanism which caused no good to anyone.
The greatest priest, Charwak, shouted at Yudhistra that you
had to repent over this religious battle because you are the rnalacious
kind who help in putting to end his relatives and worthy gurus. That is
why you will have to die on the pyre. After a long discussion over this
issue among Rajprohit (religion), Yudhistra. other Pandevs (Politics)
Charwak (Truth), Yudhistra has got ready the pyre and also agrees to sit
on it. But all the Pandevs and Rajprohits forcefully push Yudhistra inside
and said that Charwak is the companion of Karvan. They also lifted
Charwak, put him into the pyre and burnt him into ashes. l n this way the
truth is burnt amidst the tactics of religion and politics.
