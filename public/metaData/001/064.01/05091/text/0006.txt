We get no opportunity to enjoy fun in life, full of fret and fever as it is today. And here we are
to entertain you through a particular style "Commendiadell‘ Art," But kindly do no expect any
revolution from this venture. We have had enough of revolutionary theater; let's do now only theatre.
This play written about 200—250 years before is meaningful even today. The original form is being
presented to you through our mother tongue. In every society it is difficult for a lone woman to exist
and make do in the circumstances that we always adverse. But her vicissitude are brought about
through comedy in this play.

The island is written by Athol Fugard, which, originally set in South Africa notorious Robben Island
prison, is considered one ofthe most significant plays ofthe twentieth century.
it tellsthe story of two prisoners John 8: Winston -who are shackled together for much of the time and
working hard all the day under inhuman authority. At the night they begin to recover from their work
squabbling, fighting, and laughing like any other couple. The play examines the bonds and tensions between them - who, having been Rebel fighting for a cause. are now deemed to rot in their cells in
the most dehumanising conditions. The authorities terrorise them but cannot control their thoughts
and they find new innovative ways to remain sane.
In the play we find them after a hard day’s work rehearsing for a prison concert. They enact scenes
from Sophocles' Antigone as a Ioded tribute to 'a fellow seeker of justice who deliberately defies an
unjust law" as atheatrical gesture of defiance.” "Antigone' represents from them the continuing struggle against an oppresive regime,
under the garb of democracy. The play sees them grapple with their harsh environment, unexpected hope, overwhelming despair,
the strength oftheir friendship and their innate humaneness.
