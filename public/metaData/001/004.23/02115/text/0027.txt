rustic dialect as the narrator but moves on easily to the sophisticated dialogues of the

royalty.
The narrator enacts with equal ease the various roles of her story.

She is

Draupadi and Yudhisthira, Duryodhana and Shakuni, Karna and Krishna and other

characters as the play demands.

She establishes each character separately, often using

different ‘types’ to do so. Her slipping in and out of the different roles is so easy
that her spectators can identify all the characters of the epic as well as her principal
role of a narrator. At some place, the narrator sings a plaintive Song, with the ac

companiment of her ‘juri’, but her movements suggest a portrayal of Draupadi.

The

two level intermingled with perfect case, it is a total experience to the audience.

The musical chorus or the ‘juri’ helps the narrator through various moods of
the play, now reoncing, now sad.

And the instruments used are Indian.

Naathabati

Anaathabat is by all means an Indian production. Nevertheless, it is amazingly modern.
Drawing on the rich tradition of folk—theatre in India, the play bring sits spectators
face to face with the contemporary reality.

The creator of the play has culled out

fragments of various traditions and synthesized them to create a new classicity, a fresh
idiom for our present day theatre.
