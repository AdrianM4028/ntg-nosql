दो कौडी का खेल
[ Based on Brecht’s “The Three penny opera” an opera in Hindi of 2 hrs duration ]

Brecht’s “The Three penny opera” is a world renowned play which has been
performed in almost all major languages and cities of the world.

While rewriting and

producing the play the playwright and director Parimal Datta has taken the present sociopoli
tical canvas of the country as the backdrop; satire and humour are the main motif of the
production.

In an atmosphere of corruption, confusion and degradation of values everywhere, the
chorus decide to narrate the story of Bhayanak Singh, a small dacoit.

Through the operations

of Bhayanak and Narhari Poddar, a crook, the chorus could convince the audience that dacoits
like Bhayanak or crooks like Narhari are the natural oﬁ'springs of a devoid social and

political system who can be eliminated by changing the system only.
