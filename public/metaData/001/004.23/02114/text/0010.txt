Message
For someone like me who has cherished theatre
for long, nothing can be more welcome than a theatre
festival. Not only is it a visual feast of a highly developed
performing art, but also a reﬂection of man’s feeling for
his fellow beings and his ability to act and inter-act
with them.
I have often tried to get back to theatre, sadly it
has not been possible. And honestly, I do certainly miss
the passion and excitement of putting together a play,
learning one’s lines and then performing before an audience
that is as involved with the play as the cast is.

Nevertheless, I try and make the most of every
opportunity that I get to see a play. What gives me
particular satisfaction is the effort made by a majority of
those involved in the theatre movement in our country
to focus greater attention on contemporary iSSues.

I was fortunate to get an
in theatre both in school and
has kept me in good stead over
cularly cherish is the sense of

opportunity to participate
college. This experience
the years. What I partidiscipline and spirit of
camaraderie that the stage taught me.
I am delighted that Roopkatha is organising a
week long drama festival in Allahabad from Nov. 5 to

Nov. 10, 1985

For a city so rich in art and culture, it

should be a festive occasion

My best wishes for the success of this festival.
