R A M AYA N A

A Scene from Ramayana

“Ramayana” is a classic in puppet based
on the great Indian epic. Its spectacular
presentation and grandeur are rarely found
in a puppet production. This has also been
performed popularly all over the country,
both in Bengali and Hindi.
The play starts with the episode of Rama's
leaving for Viswarnistra’s Tapovan to kill
Taraka and ends with the return of Rama
Chandra With Seeta & Laksman to Ajodhya
after rescuing Seeta from Lanka.

base and not meant for itself but to enhance
the significance of the end product namely
the Puppet Stage. Kathakali was effectively
put to use in RAMAYANA"
