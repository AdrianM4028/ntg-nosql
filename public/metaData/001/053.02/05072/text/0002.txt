Synopsis:
The play was developed metaphorically through the cartoons and their caricatured body.
During the process, Cartoons indeed became the medium for the psyche to look at the
different perspective of certain situations. Resembling the cartoon, the performance
also communicates with zest of humor and satire.
The characters are also inspired from the cartoons. The performance caters the
poorest man at the periphery yet awaiting education, whose brain's physical
development is still to ensue, and who doesn't have ability to criticize.
