I am happy to learn that the 2nd India Theatre Olympiad is being
organized in New Delhi by the National Institute of Performing
Arts from November 1 5-21 , 1991.
Theatre represents one of the most ancient forms of arts, a
powerful medium for propagating ideas and ideals of human
values and raising social consciousness. As long as mankind,
its civilization and culture exist Theatre will always be playing an
important role in the life of society, in promoting and
establishing better understanding and friendship among the
people throughout the world in particular.
The Olympiad attended by theatre companies from different
countries gives deeply responsive Indian audiences an opportunity to appreciate various schools and trends of performing arts.
I congratulate the organizers and all participants of this
international Theatre Festival and wish the 2nd India Theatre
Olympiad every success.
