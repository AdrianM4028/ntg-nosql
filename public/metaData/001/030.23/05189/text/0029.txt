GREETINGS
Representing Asian Regional Centre of International Amateur
Theatre Association, I would like to offer my ' sincere
congratulations for India Theatre Olympiad ‘91 .
The fact that this Theatre Festival is held again gives me the deep
impression all participants in this festival can share the basic idea
— “for better understanding through theatre" with each other.
Nothing can be more highly valued now than to be friendly and
feel benevolent to each other. Cultural exchanges through
theatre — where certain problems of the human situation are
discussed —- seem to be an ideal means to make mutual
understanding between nations thorough and deep.
I sincerely express a great respect and gratitude to my friends in
India who organized this theatre festival after getting over many
difficulties.
