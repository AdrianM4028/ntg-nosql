MESSAGE

I am glad to know that the National Institute of Performing Arts
is organising 2nd India Theatre Olympiad from 15th November,
1991 at New Delhi and bringing out a souvenir on this occasion.
The Indian theatre has always inﬂuenced the contemporary
world of performing arts. It has not only been the mirror of our
society but also given a glimpse of our rich cultural heritage.
Enlightened artists can give new directions to the people
irrespective of geographical boundaries. I am sure that the event
will give an opportunity to witness some interesting items of
performing arts.
I wish the Festival all success.
