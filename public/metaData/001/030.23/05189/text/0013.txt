MESSAGE
I am glad to know that the National Institute of Performing Arts
is going to organise the 2nd India Theatre Olympiad in New Delhi
from 15 November to 21 November, 1991 . India has hosted
many events of International importance in the past but this
Theatre Olympiad is going to be an uniorgettable event. This will
help in establishing public understanding and friendship amongst
the countries of the world. Performing arts is a powerful media
which helps in proper dissemination of the ideas.

I wish for the success of the Olympiad.
