Uganda in this olympiad and Seminar.
1 commend the efforts for good arrangement and organisation.
Like most African Countries, Ugandan

History about Theatre was not documented early enough, but all the same,
the theatrical activities have been on
since time irnrnernorial. It is also important to note that before people learnt
how to read and write, theatrical activi-

ties used to be the best teacher to the
young through child play songs and
games, to the youth and the old persons through Music Dance and Drama.
These activities were used for entertainment as well. They were transfered
from one generation to another up to
the present Modem stage but not 105ing the traditional cultural touch.
The early performers used
to
present
their activities
around the

fire place in a
given arena.
This was so
"
‘ because in
’ J /‘ Uganda, fire is

in most cases
a drum was used because it could bring
a sense of belonging and acted as a
symbol of power. The drum was the
most entertaining musical instrument
in Uganda and East Africa.’ Right now,
,

it still carries the strength but in a
modern way.
The stage of Theatre
With the present changes in development throughout the whole world. Music
Dance and Drama in Uganda was not
left behind. Ur'tlike in the old days, the
three categories of theatre are now
distinct i.e. there are groups of modern
band music, modern country music
with both traditional and western
musical instruments, folk music, dance
groups,both traditional and modern
drama groups and there are those which
combine all, NamirembetQiramactors
Inclusive.
‘The themes of the performances, as it
is in the rest of the world depend on
who is presenting what But, there are
three major classes: Art f‘orArt’s sake,
Art for Education,
Art for Development.
it is important to note here that there is
always an entertaining factor in all the
three categories.
in Uganda, our administrative structure is as follows;
