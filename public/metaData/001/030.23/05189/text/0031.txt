THEATRE OLYMPIAD IS ARTISTES' DREAM COME TRUE

WELCOME

A dream is going to be a reality. The Second India Theatre Olympiad ‘91 is going to be
held in New Delhi in collaboration with International Amateur Theatre Association
(lATA) from 15th to 21 st November, 1991 . The Theatre Olympiad has come a long way.
The Second India Theatre Olympiad, scheduled to be held in February, 1991, had to be

postponed due to the Gulf War. I must say that participation from foreign countries has
been possible due to personal efforts of the President, International Amateur Theatre As-

sociation, Mr. Hugh Love grove Mr. John Ytteborg
Pru Kitching, Administrator.

Secretary General of lATA and Ms.

In India a host of persons in the Government, industry, Media and the general public have
very generously cooperated to make the event a grand success. It was anybody’s guess
as to how an infant and financially weak institution like NIPA is attempting to hold an Inter-

national event. Well, nothing succeeds like success.
It is our proud privilege to extend a very hearty welcome to all the foreign participants,

lATA officials and all art loving people, particularly in the field of Theatre,who have joined
hands in this endeavour. There are so many people working behind the curtain day and
night with no expectation just for a cause or self search, We salute them. we welcome

them. We hope that our foreign participants and guests will find this one week of interaction in this country of such cultural heritage, a very meaningful and rewarding expenence.
We do hope that HIPA will continue to have their blessings, support and co—operation in
all future activities for the promotion and preservation of performing arts and to help bring
about international peace and human understanding.
