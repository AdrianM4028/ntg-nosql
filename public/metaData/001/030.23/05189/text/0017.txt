MESSAGE
I was very pleased to hear of the India Theatre Olympiad â€™9 1- in
which also a German group is participating.
I wish the organisers, the perfong groups and the audience a
pleasant and enjoyable Festival.
The opportunity to see theatre performances from different countries, their various subjects and ways of expression will certainly
make for a special experience which will be remembered for a
long time.
