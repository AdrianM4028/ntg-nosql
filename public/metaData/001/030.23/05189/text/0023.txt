MESSAGE

It gives me pleasure to know that the National Institute of Performing Arts, New Delhi, in collaboration with International Amateur
Theatre Association, Denmark, is holding 2nd ‘India Theatre
Olympiad’ from November 15 to 21 at New Delhi.

Such international cultural festivals not only provide an opportunity to the people to acquaint themselves with the culture and
theatre of other countries, but also enable the performing artistes
to have better understanding of their own cultural heritage . Thus ,
these, in tact, become educational endeavour.
