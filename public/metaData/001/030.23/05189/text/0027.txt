It gives me the very greatest pleasure to extend the good wishes
of our world-Wide organisation, AI'I‘A/IA'I‘A to this Second India
Theatre Olympiad. Certainly, from all the excellent reports
received from the many international participants of the First
Olympiad in 1989, a very powerful model has been established
which promises well for this year’s event and, I am sure, for the
future.
Thanks to the excellent initiatives of the National Institute of
Performing Arts and others working in the ﬁeld of theatre in India ,
the whole brotherhood of Indian theatre is firmly established
in our international organisation. I have, myself recently seen
outstanding groups from this country acquitting themselves
superbly in places as far afield as Japan है Germany and Norway.
Now, I look forward to being your guest at this Second Olympiad
and sharing with you all in a veritable feast of international
theatre in the beautiful setting of India and its legendary
hospitality.
