T H E WORKSHOP
This evening you are witness to the culmination of an unparalleld

event is the long history of theatre in this city - a Theatre
Workshop.

Perhaps, we had better explain.
A Workshop in Theatre Seeks to introduce and expose its participants to all the aspects of drama - classes in direction, movement, acting. inprovisation. yoga, Scenic design, lighting, makeup

Stagernanagement, business management at form part of the
curriculum.

We attempted to tie up the “dreary” theory with its immediate ‘
and praccical application. Eminent theater personalities were
‘invited to give talks on subject related to theatre. The plays
this evening are besically the work of the participants who talk

on the various responsibilities involved.
Originally we had planned on having only 25 participants (and
" We thought this was ambitiousl). But the response was so overwhelming and in our policy to reach as many peaple as possible
we decided to double the number to 49-most of them new.

Now, this ends and we are conﬁdent that the Workshop will
give further impetus to the theatre movement in the region.

By the by, a word of thanks" and a pat on the shoulder of
S‘hrl Govind Hari Singhania who let this “happening” happen.
