३ Dear Mr. Singh,
I have the pleasure to acknowledge the ministry of the
Good News Broadcasting Society under your leadership.
The Christian ministry rendered by your organisation has

endeared itself due to its

melodious music and the Biblically

rooted clear heart stirring messages. The Word proclaimed
by you celebrates the rhythm of God’s love. It touches the
chord of human heart and echos the truth with the joyous news
of salvation which God has offered free through Christ Jesus
for all those who would believe in 11181. The enchanting music
should not stop to the itching ears but should lead to
conversion of lives of its listeners in Christ the Redeemer.

To this sacred end the Good News Broadcasting Society i
commit ted.

~

We praise God for His love and His word. We thank God
for your ministry. It brings us nearer to God each day as we
५ listen His messages sent for all the listening ears and

… the searching hearts.

May it be all to His glory.
Yours Sincerely,

.,
