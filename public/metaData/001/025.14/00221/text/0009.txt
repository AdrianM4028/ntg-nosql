EVerywhere !

It had been a long standing desire for us to stage a
Christian play in one of the leading auditoriums of
Delhi. The Lord has heard our prayer and we are really
excited as preparations are ahead for staging this
drama entitled PYAASA SAGAR at the KAMANI Auditorium
on 9th and 10th April 1981. About a year and a half ago

we had staged this drama in one of the leading halls
at Kanpur and had proved a great blessing to the citiz ens there.
I
It is now our prayer that through this media of the
stage, we shall be able to communicate God’s way of
salvation to times like these

We covet your prayers for the success of this play.
