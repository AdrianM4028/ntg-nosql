We here.at the Home Office in Lincoln, Nebraska,
are rejoicing in the wonderful open door God has
given our co—laborers in India. The various
broadcasts, including the drama for the youth,
are reaching a great host of people with the
wonderful gospel of salvation and the Word of
God.

We believe the Lord has opened an effectual door
at this time all over the world; and we must make
use of it. We are so glad that our co-workers
in India are making use of the open door right
there before them. We are praying that God will
'give great success. We think it is a wonderful
means of proclaiming the Good News.
Sincerely yours,
