When Khongjomba became Moirang laijing, Kabui Shalang refused to pay tributes to Moirang. To reconquer
Shalang, Puremba was promoted to K/iao'l'a/(pa and sent to
encounter the Kabuis. When Puremba was marching
towards Western hills he captured one wild damsel of
V'Ngangkha the dale. Puremba also defeated Shalang and
३ brought handsome tributes to the laiji/rg. With the per.
mission of laijing, the wild damsel was adopted by a bevy
of ladies for one year. Ngangkhachanu, as she was
named, was endowed with such courtly manners, and
virtues that even the laijing kept an eye on her. Seeing
,. this the laijing/embi Pidongnu adopted her in the laijinglron
, (Palace). In the meanwhile, when laijing was heading
LMoirang Army in the forest for huntingwild beasts to
offer to Lord Thangjing, Puremba saved him from the

attack of nine tigers.
