When Puremba and Nongdam appeared before Pidongnu as called by her and with the sudden entry of laijing
and Chingkhuba in the scene, the play reached a crisis
and climax for saving Chaoba's life from Nongdam.
Nongdam resolved to die as he had failed to kill Chaoba
as he was already saved by Puremba by a debted promise.
Puremba also resolved to die in place of Nongdam as he
thought that the promise of his friend Nongdam would
have been his promise too, in case he knew earlier that
Chaoba killed his friend's wife. Heated dialogues were

exchanged about the value of promises.

How the deci-

Finally, Puremba became the scapegoat with the cunning
' plan of Chingkhuba. He had to die for the promise of
his friend Nongdam after the lapse of five months. He
was now stripped of the post of K/Iadra/(pa. Worn and dejected, he stood lonely against the world. He now fully
realised that he was made a victim of a conspiracy, that
he did not belong to the soil of Moirang, since he was a
Khuman. He became virtually a social outcast. In the
midst of such agony and loneliness of his existence, his
wife Ngangkhachan u also died suddenly after the lapse of
three months after giving birth to a son. Leaving behind
his daughter and son to his maid Yurenjambignaming
Kharnnu and Khamba whom he so named to symbolise
them to bring to an “end" to a powerful class dominating
over a helpless but talented generation, Puremba meditated to die at Loishang Khangjeng after the completion
of five months. Puremba‘s last word to Yurenjambi before
he died was to send his children to Shalang to bring
them up in order to be able them to fight the dominating
powerful class of which he was a victim.
