Ba=ed on a well known Manipuri porverb whc h actually means observation of
the Royal lady made the pegeon scorched,

The play depicts the strange ways of modern life in which the people are forced
to constantly change their masks to ﬁt
into the gigantic z‘g-saw of this erratic
society.

The episodic treatment of the play serves
to emphasise the inereasing curruption of
the society and ultimately the contention
to supress the truth in order to cover up

the follies cnnittcd, and to highlight

the

tragic reality of our soceiey.

The modern society is gyrating in a entangled . perpetual motion of fabricated
conﬂicts

and contradictions of the tradi-

tional and modern values.

Lack of tolerance, understanding and emotional integrity has cauied man to dift
apart :3 id the human beings have become
isolated lonely creatures amids this madding crowd.
