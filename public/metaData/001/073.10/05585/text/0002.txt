LENGSONEl
This production aims to place a
comparative study of both Indian and
Greek myths and adapted to a tribal
atmosphere similar to the Greek norm of
rituals, ceremonials and environmental
juxtaposition in the hill community of
North Eastern region of India. Equipped

with the backdrop of beautiful sceneries,
wild flowers, ceremonial stones at the
village gates, thatched-roofed huts on the
top of the Hills, the streams which flows
through the stones with mosses- our
production thrives the possibilities of
speaking and interpreting it in the
indigenous style of Indian context.
The production also concentrates on a
comparative study of Greek structure of a
play and Indian convention, that there are
many episodes which are not visible on
stage but always has been very climactic
in the thernetic force of the play whereas
the Indian counter-part even in the
structure of classical Sanskrit plays, the
episodes are climactic visually on Stage.
Now the main attempt is to bring out the
best possibilities of visible and invisible
episodes utilising it both for meaningful
deeper interpretation in terms of SocioPolitical Phenomenon and to highlight the
broken image of human relationship in our
contemporary Society.

The ever unending Struggle in between the
human sensation of love and other
Biological Phenomenon of emotions and
sentiments which the Greeks defined as
the Devine-Iaw of Gods against the human
Iavvs of power, politics and Society,
reflecting in the play will be of a certain
knowledge to our present audience. A
momentary reflection of our audiences on
the above two opposing human laws of
life may at-least console or may be
helping in Ô¨Ånding a way out which will
appeal human reasoning.
