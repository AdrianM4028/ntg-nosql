The writer of this paper shall be totally incompetent to write a narrative
about the complexities and diversities of theatre activity in contemporarv India.
It will be imposible to write with authority on theatre idioms, techniques, production values and fOrm of expression regularly seen in various state capitals
and metropolises. Not much of theatre people from this region had deliberately
travelled to conspicious areas of theatre experimentation to study these concerns, nor any Manipuri theatre critic has seen first hand major Indian director's works and plays written by major Indian playwrights as performed at a his
torical point of time.

Most of the comments we could make is from reviews, from articles that
appear in journals, books that are published, and from limited personal viewing
of plays presented in festivals. workshops and at specially sponsored shows
and inter-actions with theatre persons. This type of review therefore shall fall
far short of objectivity and dispassionate participation in relevant discourse on
contemporary life.
. . Another model of study from a regional viewpoint is to undertake a review of the structural features of some good regional director works, the style
and creative expressions as immanent in, his plays and try to discover the psycological. motivtions in his choice of plays and forms of production. It is also

pertinent to probe his concern in the network of relationships that he had built
up in the official institutions and agencies that support major inputes in contemporary theatre. The circulation of his work in specially designed channels of
ofÔ¨Åcial, institutionlized activity shall help us discover his ideology, logic.
and
motivation in the exercise of his creative faculty and to understand his histori-

cal position and objective situation of contemporary theatre in India. This
major effort shall have handicaps if we do not have a participatory dialog
ue
with the purveyors of this contemporary activity whereby frank insights into
his
worldview could be understood and evaluated. In contemporary Manipur,
the
the only telling factor is that theatre has reduced itself into
commodities. and
