Wairokpam Karnini (b 1948) is another symbolist writerwhose main concern is
humanism and he attempts to re-discover it he feels that every individual in the
society has love and piety for his follow beings but individualism persisting in
the present society makes man cast away these cherished values and life becomes tranmatic. Therefore Kamini feels that in order to regain a blissful life man
should do some sacrifice of his personal interest, his 'Hingningliba Thawai (soul
longing for life) is the manifestation of this thought.
Two other writers of note but of opposite sentiments who are younger to the
group are Nildhwaja Khuman (b.1950) and Khundrakpam Brajachand (b. 1952).
Nildhwajs, probing deeper into the inner concerns of man exposes his hidden
desire of living a cherished way of life, but on the contrary, the
contradictions

in the society being unsurmountable obstacles he being withered away
along
with his nostalsic desire. His 'Epom Amadi Ethak’ (from a ripple to
a wave) is a
play which testify his mastery over to craft with colourful splash
es of pastorial
beauty.
On the otherhand, Khundrakpam Brajachand (1952)
is of the opposite brand
who brandishes his sharp phrases with a swashb
uckling manner on the hypocrisy of modern man. He satires the Meitei
mind, living on a nostalgic
pride but cowardly enough even to claim his ow
n house. Instead of sympathy
on their folly, he rebukes them on thei
r inherent hypocrisy. His ‘Eigi Yum'
(My House) is the testimony of his
statement.
Another serious younger is Yumna
m Rajendra (1953) who has written m
any
plays but inclined more on direct
orship. The complex situaton of

is the main impulse for Rajendra t

play ‘Chekkhairabi Malem’ (The
Cracking Earth). His concern fo

t

of the innocents by the modern d
