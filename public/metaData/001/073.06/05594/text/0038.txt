of India. They retain their distinctive character and their presence is accepted
deliberately and cultured intentionally. and instrumentally as part of the diverse
techno-commercial and cultural complexes of Indian products. But Manipuri

Indian Dosa or Idli, which had become essential, needed features of modern

Indian costumeries or cuisine. An essentially integrated and naturally emotiona-lized social experience does not underlie the circulation of Manipuri products.
goods, services and art efforts in mainstream India. There lies the essential
contradiction of Manipuri presence in the Indian mainland.
What the author tries to establish is that the haloed attempt made by directors like Rattan Thiyam to integrate with the mainstream Indian cultural cons~

does not mix spontaneously with mainstream practices and behaviour. The plays
of Manipur cannot simply be planted in Indian soil and merged into the mainstream philosophy with a naturalness of emotion and warmth, but a certain deliberateness. a played up artfulness and coy artiﬁciality pervade the contribution of
Manipuri contemporary theatre on pan-Indian philosophy of development and
self-actualization.

Rattan Thiyam as Director of National School of Drama and Shyam Sharma as
Head of the national jury of film recently.
