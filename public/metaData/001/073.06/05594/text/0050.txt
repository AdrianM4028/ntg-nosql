on» the 19th of June 1939. Hijam Anganghal wrote 'Poktabi' and ‘Ibemma'
and ‘Ibemma' was staged in 1939. These writers wrote their plays on the
model of western drama as they knew it from their College days and from
the Bengalee plays of that period.
These plays were the products of these writers with a world view of
their own which they concieved from their own experience of life. Theirs
was a simple society without much complications of life as of today. Religion
played a strong part in developing strong moral principles and these writers
being devot Vaishnavites held strong sense of good, evil and piety. It was

Manipur to the Indian Union the new class were self-satisfied with the sense of
guiding the people towards peoples rule and democracy.
It was during this period that many native writers came up and they brough
t
out many plays on Mythology, Historical and social times. But. the social plays
didn’t reﬂect the agony of the human situations effected by the turmoils of th
e
War, most of the plays were of love, hate, good and evil conﬂicts. Some
