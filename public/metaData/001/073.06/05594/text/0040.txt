This aspect of theatre culture however is yet to take an organic (shape. It
will have to ﬁght on many fronts of inability to sustain itself, social indifference
and neglect, and general weakness of the human individual to cultivate a vision
of life in an environment rapidly deteriorating at the same time devaluing concerns of humanism and human life. The total reality of the society in turmoil

gives the theatre of process an opportunity to study its own role of searChing
for true meaning of the course of one's being, in the course of one '3 future to
be. The approaches of a few individuals and organizations in contemporary
Manipur reflect this departure from normal concerns in theatre. They have yet
to project an alternative to the alternative theatre in Manipur. This seems to be
the historical responsibility of Kanhailal and the organization to which the writer
belongs.
