Folk Dances of India
Amongst the performing arts, dance is perhaps the oldest form of expression ofjoy and
sorrow. The earliest cave paintings bear testimony to the fact that man not only wanted to
dance but also wanted to capture this movement in drawzng.
Indian folk dances have close links with functions of daily life like sowing, harvesting,
hunting, festivals and rituals. Perhaps that is why Indian folk dances have a great

multiplicity of themes, styles of presentation and reasons for performing them. Yet they
have a quality of spontaneity, of collective participation without the barriers of
performance and audience.

Collective dancing in India has deep roots as seen in the cave paintings that are older
than Mohenjo Dam and Harappa. The Vedas and the two great epics give accounts of
collective dancing. With these traditions run the timeless tribal streams which give an
account of collective dancing being an integral, even a necessary part of life.

In the Indian sub-continent, because of the multiplicity of races, religions, ethnic
groups and family structures, there exists an incomparable richness of folk traditions.
Forms of pre-historic times have survived here and new ones have been born. New
inﬂuences have been absorbed and assimilated indiscernably. This has led not only to it
great variety in the dances, it has also added a number of musical instruments, a variety of

rhythms and a richness of literary content in forms of songs and poetry.
The classification of folk dances is complicated because categories overlap and
intermingle due to the multi-layered traditions. Yet scholars have made some effort at
broad divisions as follows:
0 Hunt dances

० Dances of rituals, rites, propitiation of spirits and others
0 Dances centred around agricultural functions
० Dances centred around seasonal cycles and festivals

Dances and dance dramas based on the epics
Devotional dancing
Traditional dance drama forms, like leelas, jatras etc.
