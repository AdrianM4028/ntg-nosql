Folk traditions have changed and grown with time, with industrialisation, urbanisation

and with changes in social and political systems. However, the basic elasticity of these
forms has helped them to develop their virile character on the one hand and grace and
simplicity on the other. The folk forms represent the aspirations and the beliefs of the
people, their dauntless faith in the good and their high spirited struggle against
calamnities, their admiration for valour and their respect for the unknown.

It is impossible to present all folk dances of India in a single festival yet it is our effort to
represent not just each region in this festival but also to depict a wide variety, each
depicting a different mood, temperament and pattern.
Folk dances had earlier formed an integral part of the Republic Day pageant. This year
a departure has been made. On the occasion of the Republic Day, the Department of
Culture of the Government of India has, through its seven Zonal Cultural Centres
organised a special festival of folk dances, drawn from all parts of the country.
The four day Republic Day Folk Dance Festival has more than thirty different troupes
from all parts of the country participating in it.
The Folk Dance Festival presents an exposition of a wide range offolk performances:
Jhamakada of Himachal Pradesh, Charkula of Uttar Pradesh, Bagstornches or the
