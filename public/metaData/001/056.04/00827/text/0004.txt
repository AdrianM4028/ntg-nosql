Folk Dances of India
Tribal and folk dances have been responsible for sustaining the long continuity of
ancient traditions. Besides providing an enduring link between the past and thepresent they
constitute thefoundations ofmajor movements ofclassical arts. Amongst the arts, dance is '
at once the most primitive and the most sophisticated expression ofhuman experience and
em0 tion .

Thefunctions ofdaily life be they mundane activities likefood gathering, daily chores,
sowing and harvesting, the exciting display ofmartialprowess, hunting andﬁshing, the rites
and rituals to propitiate gods and spirits; all remain the central concern andpre-occupation
of artistic creation, carriedforward, sustained andfostered by succeeding generations of
communities through persistent recreation and repetition.
Inspite of the great variation and diversity of themes, forms and styles, folk art andfolk
dance continue to be a distinct category characterized by a unique quality ofspontaneity and
of mass participation, where no barriers exist between the creator and the actor; the
performer and the audience.

The Indian sub-continent with its overwhelming multiplicity of races, religions,
linquistic and ethnic groups, varied social structures, possesses an incomparable richness of
folk traditions. Pre-historic forms have survived inspite of phenomenal historical and
sociological changes even while newforms have come into existence and new inﬂuences have
been absorbed and assimilated indiscernably resulting in the great variety of the dances,
rhythms, the number ofmusicial instruments and the richness ofliterary content as evident
in the content andform of the accompanying songs and poetry.

All thefolk dances oflndia are representative ofthe aspiration and beliefs ofthepeople,
an expression of their life in its various aspects as well as an aesthetic experience which is
enriching and enduring. The twentyfourfolk dances included in thisfestival bear this out
and bring to us for a few moments almost every part of India.
