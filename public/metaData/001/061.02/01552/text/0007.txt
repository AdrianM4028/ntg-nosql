Me and my girl
Presentation - Prime Time

A Musical Comedy
Book and Lyrics by L. Arthur Rose and Douglas Furber

The story of Cockney cut-up Bill Snibson who .inherits the title and
fortune of the Eart of Hareford, subject to his ability to convince the
will's aristocratically snooty executors of his suitability, unfolds with
nonstop tomfoolery. Pun follows pun as Bill steadfastly refuses to give
up his Lambeth girl friend Sally Smith to gain his fortune. The happy
charm of true love triumphant makes “Me and My Girl” a winner.
