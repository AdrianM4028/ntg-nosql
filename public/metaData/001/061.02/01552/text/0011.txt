Presentation - Asmita

Our idea is to break this myth. For what we visualise about the various

character and situations within the play is their contemporariness,
which otherwise has been put up by the dramatist drawing comparisons between the socio-economic and political condition of a
period as old as 800 years and of our modern times or for both. Our
emphasis is on highlighting this contemporary touch in the Play. The
plot highlight the clash between power, politics and religion in which
neither side gains but a third party has been left with an opportunity
to exploit the situation. This party represents a true picture of our
opportunist modern times. This play is a saga of a man who ultimately
got confused with his own vision of life while fighting various
deterrents, lossing his sensitivity, high morals and humanity. This play
choosing incidents from Mohammad-Bin-TughIaq's life, sketches a
drama full of human sentiments, clash of human values, social relation
and politics.
