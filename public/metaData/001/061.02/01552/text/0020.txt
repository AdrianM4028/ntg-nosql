ROMEO 8: JEANETTE
Presentation - Saakshi

Jeannette refuses to accept the petty ugliness and compromise of
middle-class life meets Frederic, who is engaged to Jeannette's sister
Julia who is supposed to be a paragon of middle-class virtues.
Frederic and Jeannette fall in love and Frederic realises that the
world he believed in has another more attractive side.

In order to preserve the perfection of love, Jeannettee proposes
double suicide, but Frederic insists that life must be lived and death
too is absurd.
In the end, however, Frederic rejects the absurdity of his proposed
life with Julia and accepts the absurdity of death with Jeannette.
