The ballad singer will be heard singing
of your name
of your blood
of your breast smashed
by gun butts

of your sad smile
your voice will be a song
in the ears of
wheat
which spring from
your broadcast bones
it will be present in the mouths
of children born in
proletarian dawn
it will be there
your voice will be there
to sing the death

of the martyrs
the song of the heroes
of hunger
injustice
victory !
