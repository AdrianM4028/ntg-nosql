"CREATION IS NOR AND NEVER BEEN A GENTEEL GESTURE.
IT IS RUDE, VIOLENT AND REVOLUTIONERY"
AND THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT STAND DREAMING ON THE
VERGE OF STRIFE, NOR DID THEY PLUNGE INTO STRUGGLE WITHOUT
THOUGHT.
AND FOR SO MANY GENEROUS HEARTED MEN & WOMEN ALL OVER,
THE FOCAL POINT OF CHANGE WAS THE WAR BETWEEN THE OPPRESSOR
AND THE OPPRESSED.
AND THOSE WERE THE YEARS IN WHICH THE EXISTENCE OF CRISES WAS
BROUGHT HOME TO ALL BUT THE MOST BUTTERFLY-MINDED.
AND SO MANY DIED, MAY SO SPEAK THAT THE PEOPLE WILL BEGIN TO
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY LIVE 8: DIE, FOR IT SEEMS NOTHING LESS THAN
THE INDUBITABLE SIGNATURE OF DEATH WILL MAKE PEOPLE BELEIVE IN
THEIR SACRIFICES.
FOR THEY DID NOT MERELY DIED FOR THEIR BELEIFS.
THEY LIVED FOR THEM.

SINGH IS A PLAY ABOUT OUR TIMES.
