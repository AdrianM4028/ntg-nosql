In view of conditions
in this town
This Is how I act:
When l'enter 1 give
my name and show
Papers which prove It
by stamps that
Cannot be forged

When I say anything I cite
witnesses of whose credibility
I have proofs,

VVhen lsay noﬂﬁng

I give my face
ﬁn expression of vacuity
so it can be seen that

1 am not thinking
Thus
I allow no one to believe me.
all forms of trust
I reject

I do this because I know:
Conditions in this town
Make belief impossible.
