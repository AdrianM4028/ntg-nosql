Does someone have the right to impose his will on a

.small child running in a street, chasing a kite?
With the fall of a tyrant, can mankind celebrate the end
of tyranny? He only has to look around, for the monster

is still there, waiting to rise again. Hidden amongst us, he
is waiting for his chance. To prevent such an eventuality
is what we live for. It is part of our endless struggle to save
humanity. It is this struggle which makes life worth living,

When morals are in question, when sanity no longer
prevails, when the line between "Right" and "Wrong" is
drawn to suit those in power, the nightmare has just
begun. Only vulture will thrive.

Unless Humanity raises its voice and sings a song
song about the dark times.
