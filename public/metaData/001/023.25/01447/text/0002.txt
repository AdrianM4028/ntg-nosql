In synthesrses the almost tragic dynamism of the characters and their
behaviour with cruel impasse of their lives.
“Jab Shahar Hamara Sota Hai” is about a generation which displays
youthful directness, which is no more tolerant, no more subtle and is

emotionally charged. It brings to the stage a whole world of injustice,
hatered and intolerenoe. And there in the middle of it all stands a girl with
a gentle, hesitant, slightly puzzled smile looking tenderly, searchineg into
her lover’s eyes, listening intently and slightly anxiously to what they are
saying.
It is all about innocence scarred by the truth life introduces it to. The
lovers benovelence, strangled by the vice grip of fanaticism.
What matters to them is the love they have sworn for one another. What
threatens them are the looming clouds of seething hatred their people
have inherited.
The pair, like pigeons take off in ﬂight searching for a part of the sky
from which a ray of sunlight pierces through the overcast, promising that
there is a light beyond. Light of reason, light of sanity and light of hope.
The pigeons must race. They do. Together. Forever.

It is based on “West side Story” by Jerome D. Robins
