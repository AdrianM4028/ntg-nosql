In view of conditions
in this town
This is how I act:
When I enter I give
my name and show

Papers whlch prove It
by stamps that
Cannot be forged
When I say anything I cite
witnesses of whose credibility

1 have p’r’oofs.
VVhen Isay noﬂﬁng
I give my face

ﬂn expression of vacuity
so it can be seen that
I am not thinking
Thus
I allow no one to believe me.

ﬂll forms of trust
I reject
1 do this because I know:
Conditions in this town
Make belief impossible.
