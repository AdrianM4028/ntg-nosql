«W.

In a society which is no longer able to
discriminate between the human and
the bestial their lives have been
reduced to a mere spectacle. To be
strangled, to be preached to, but never
to be honoured.
Who are they? Merely a creation,
created to be played with and then to be
destroyed. Or are they life personified

by the fact of their existence.
They demand to be heard. They demand
to be honoured. They demand that they
be allowed to live.
September 27th 1994, Act One

completes four years of its existence. To
commemorate this occasion Act One
had organised a workshop involving

young enthusiasts from different walks
of life. This play, Mujhe Bhi Chand
Chahiye, is an outcome of the workshop
and has been scripted by Piyush Mishra,
choreographed by Edwin.G.Williams
and directed by N.K.Sharma. Songs
used in this musical are from Act One’s
repertoire of songs, used in earlier
productions.
