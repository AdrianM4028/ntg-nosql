THE HAWKS
We are an elite and prestigious flying unit of the
Indian Air Force popularly known as "The Hawks’. Our
motto ‘Ever Vigilant’ should give you some idea of our

work for we are the ones who fly day and night keeping
an airborne eye on our aerial frontiers. We say no more,
but unheard and unsung, we go about our business with
quiet competence !

This year we celebrate our 21st anniversary. In
order to integrate ourselves with the society and to make

a useful social contribution, we have embarked upon the
idea of adopting a village. Various welfare measures such
as adult literacy, child care and health and social

awareness programmes have been instituted in village
Mehramnagar. Blood donation camps and educational
scholarships are also being organised.

Today's play is a projection of our cultural image.

We need your moral and material support to make .

our venture a success. Your suggestions and
contributions to this effect are welcome. The

donation box is kept outside.
