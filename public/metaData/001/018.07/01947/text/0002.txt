T0 BEGIN WITH...... .... ..
Started the workshop with chanting 0f .‘mantras' and breaking of
a coconut, Sweets were distributed and then ‘gup shup’. After this with

a ‘milk badam’ we relaxed. Next day more people flocked in. That day
we did physical excercises and improvisations. It was too much, per-

haps. Next day all participants, except two of them, disappeared. This
way the number of participants kept fluctuating and | experimented
with new faces every day. (It didn’t matter much because I needed

human material only). We built compositions, movements and improvisations. We did excerises to improve voice and speech and to gain
control on body.

This was a training period for the participants.

Gradually the number of participants became constant and we started

‘mar‘UfaCtUYing’ the play on the basis of improvisations and a few
excertpts from ‘RAS GANDHARV’.
Different aspects of acting ‘in-the-round’ and of the audience
participation were worked out.
We did a preview of the ‘unfinished’ production and number of
good suggestions came from the viewers. ' We again plunged into the
rehearsals and tried to remove the faults (although some of them could
never be removed and they became a part of the production.)

Then we did a few ‘rehearsal shows’ at various public squares
and experimented upon various aspects of audience participation. And
concluded that a ‘pure theatre’ cannot be done without an audience.
