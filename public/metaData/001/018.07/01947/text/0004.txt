ABUOT THE PLAY
The problem is not the theme ; the
problem is theatre.
At the moment I

cannot afford to

indulge in any sort

of

journalistic

few

happenings

trash.

l

have taken a

during the last two decades in our
country and translated them into a
language of ‘pure theatre.’ I project

them to the audience so that they can
enjoy the theatre and think a bit
about the flow of politics. It is my
cynicism for the political, social and
bureaucratic set-up. I am neither a
doctor for the society nor a social
reformer. I am a theatre worker who

observes a few things in the society
and projects them with his individual
view point and conviction. That’s all !
