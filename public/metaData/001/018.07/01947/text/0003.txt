0 N C 0 MM U N l TY THEATRE
A Free Stage for social, political and
cultural life—~that is the problem of
theatre in our country. Words have

little meaning; happening is important.
Something must happen in the arena
as well as in the audience. No time
for poetry or ornate language. Enough
of that ! No curtains, no sets, no

props, no lighting, no seating arrangement—because all these are a sheer

wastage in the creative process

of

‘pure theatre' No well-made plays
because doing them involves drudgery. Damn it ! A simple action is
needed for the performers as well as

for the audience.

A newspaper clip-

ping, an excerpt from a controversial
pamphlet and some incidents, are
sufficient for ‘real action’ in ‘real
theatre’.
Theatre has to take up its task of
entertainment and ‘social relevance’
It has to come out of the four walls of
the theatre and cater to the needs of
the common folk.

An organic bond has to be established between the performers and the
audience. The audience should be liv-

ing like the performers—the audience
must participate in the physical action
(regardless of the ideas to be projected). One may be just cynical or
complaisant towards a few things in a

particular society, the important thing
is to carry the audience along. The
audience can Only feel the pulse of
theatre if it actually ‘acts’.
‘ Comm u n ity theatre’ means a theatre
with the community and for the cornmunity. The audience is on the mass
scale; and in order to establish an
equilibrium, the performers" action
shall also create the illusion of mass
dimensions.
