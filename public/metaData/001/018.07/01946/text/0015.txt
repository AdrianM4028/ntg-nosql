.... ..or wait a hundred years

Pick up your arms
Fight for your rights
Grab what you need and grab it now
or wait a hundred years

and see what the authorities arrange

Up there in the sunlight

their poets sing
about the power of life

and the expensive rooms in which they scheme,
are hung with exquisitive paintings

So stand up
Defend yourselves from their whips
Stand up stand in front of them
and let them see how many of you there are
