Collection and analysis of all available material relating to Sanskrit theatre
and those forms which are living remnants of the classical style;

5

Establishment of a museum of Sanskrit theatrical arts and library of
traditional music and theatre and dance costumes etc. and their
documentation through tapes, ﬁlms and other media including production of
books of Sanskrit plays etc.;

6

Facilities for imparting training in classical theatre and for undertaking
research in related areas.

The entire approach underlying the work in the Akademi would be multidisciplinary, bringing scholarship and creative exploration and experiments to
collaborate in mutually enriching common pursuit. The accent would be not
only to explore the rich classical tradition in all its multiplicity but to constantly
relate this to the contemporary needs of creative theatre and the performing arts.
Care would be taken to ensure that the authenticity of the ancient style is
protected in order to mantain a meaningful link with the contemporary artistic
endeavour.
