KALIDASA AKADEMI

Introduction

Kalidasa is known to be the greatest repository of our national heritage. The
serenity of his artistic accomplishment has earned for him a high place in the
galaxy of world poetS. Kalidasa’s imagination holds in perfect fusion the two
elements of natural beauty and human feelings. In his case, both Eastern and
Western critics, applying not exactly analogous standards, are in general
agreement. He has always been held in high esteem.

Kalidasa has continued to display his relevance through the centuries. Surcharged
with wider human sympathy and universal appeal. his Character has remained
truly Indian. He has inﬂuenced the mentors of the middle ages, as well as the
pioneers of Indian renaissance like Vivekananda and Tagore. Kalidasa continues
to shine throughout the world as one of the greatest exponents of Indian Culture.
The keen interest of the Western Orientalists made Kalidasa studies more popular
in modern times. Kalidasa has thus gone a long way to help develop a deeper
understanding between India and the other countries.
