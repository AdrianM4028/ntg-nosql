Late Pt. Suryanarayan Vyas, himself a renowned Sanskrit scholar, was the main
visionery of a beﬁtting memorial to the great poet-dramatist of Ujjain. He had,

through his Kalidasa Parishad, raised public donations for the construction of
a Kalidasa Smriti Mandir. Kalidasa Parishad readily came forward to support
the Kalidasa Akademi by advancing Rs. 3.001akhs to start the construction
work. With the full support of the Govt. of M. P. the construction of the ﬁrst
phase estimated at Rs. 16.91 lakhs is nearing completion. The Akademi will
soon start functioning in its own premises.

The future success of the ambitious plans of Kalidasa Akademi would largely
depend on the measure of support it would receive from scholars, artists

and theatremen not only from India but from all over the world. Inspired by the
deep human sympathy of the great poet-dramatist Kalidasa Akademi visualises
to grow into an International Centre of Classical and Traditional Art and
Culture of India.
