classical and
contemporary stage in different cultural settings and language groups. In other
words, the Kalidasa Akademi is designed as a living institution to recapture the
contribution of entire Sanskrit classical tradition, theatre and the arts and
thereby reﬂect its unique vision and aesthetic perception to the international

community.
Kalidasa truly visualized a developed Sanskrit stage and it is in the ﬁtness
of things to establish an institution in his memory to project the classical theatrical
form in all its glory. Study and research of Kalidasa’s poetry and stage
style in particular; and Sanskrit stage in general, has got to be the primary
objective of the Akademi established in the honour of this great poet.
With the above objectives in View the Kalidasa Akademi has resolved to address
itself broadly to the following areas :

1

Study and exploration of Kalidasa’s literature not only purely from the literary
and academic points of View but also from the inter-disciplinary angles in
terms of its total impact on the various art forms;

2

Translation. preparation, publication and documentation of Kalidasa’s and
other Sanskrit works in various oriental as well as other world languages with
particular accent on preparing stage versions of Sanskrit plays in Hindi and
other Indian languages;

3

Establishment of a model Sanskrit theatre (Natyamandap) as per norms of
Bharata’s Natya Shastra with a view to attempt authentic reconstruction of the
ancient style and facilitate regular production of Kalidasa’s and other
Sanskrit plays by eminent classical theatremen from all over the country as
well as abroad.
