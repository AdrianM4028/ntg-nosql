This is the play by master playwright Utpal Dutt. ‘TURUP KA PATTA’ was penned by the author
after consulting the authentic documents and the records available. It is the chronicle of the
attempted sabotage of 'PANCHSHEEL' for which this country has paid a very heavy price. This is

This production has become possible because of the continuous effort of all the administrative,

has guided me in all possible ways.
TURUP KA PATTA'S conternporariness promises an experiance of total theatre which will remain
relevent to the viewer of next rnilleniurn.
