हँ छ छ के खी है;
I am happy to know that the Natya Akademi
of Goa, Daman & Diu is organising a competition
of dramatic performances. This programme aims
at encouraging histrionic talent. It will also give a
fillip to budding writers of dramas to get them on
the stage. This territory is ncted for the actcrs and
actresses provided by it for the stage and the
screen. I hope that the competition sponsored by

the “ Akademi ” will provide new recruits to this
galaxy. I wish success to the “ Akademi " in this
endeavour.
