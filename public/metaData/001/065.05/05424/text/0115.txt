FIBROMAT keeps fibres out—profits in !
Fibromat is a new fibre extractor that
works at slow speed to gather up profits fast. Because Fibromat works at a
slower speed the wear and tear on the
machine is less. Result: Fibromat cuts
, down on maintenance costs. Also the
Fibromat has greater fibre cleaning
capacity-it comes with an attachment
for ball separation and preliminary
sorting.

Steelsworth carry on research and
deveIOpment work on all aSpects of
tea manufacture in their model
experimental tea factory in Assam.
New challenges have been taken
up and soon Steeisworth hope to
introduce innovations which will
greatly benefit the tea industry.
