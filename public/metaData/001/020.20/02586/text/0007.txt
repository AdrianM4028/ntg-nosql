A word about Amrit Kala Sangam
The club, “A lVlRlT KALA SANGAM" came into existence on August 15,
1977 when it staged its first cultural programme in Mansrover Garden on the occasion
of Independence Day. A year later, it came into time light with its performance of
variety programme “SHAM-E-MEHFIL" which was very much liked and applanded, in
particular, one act play “ANARKALI Kl WAPSI" and Qawali.

Many problems and hardships came during its formation but due to
invincible courage and unshakable determination
