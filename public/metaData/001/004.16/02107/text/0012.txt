Campus Theatre is a purely self financing body
which has no grants from anywhere, nor has it
sought them. The affection of our audience, of the
people who have respected our work, and who have
felt that our effort deserves encouragement and
support, is the sole source of our confidence and the
only inspiration we have. Campus Theatre thanks
each one of you, and ends with the request that if
you have enjoyed our shows, do come again. It will
give us the strength we need.
