After Naathabati Anaathabat was staged, formation of an organisation became
necessary to run the shows regularly. Thus Pancham Vaidic came into being.
Later on, it founded a theatre institute, Pancham Veda, Charyasrama,
organised play readings of ‘Chand Baniker Pala’ and ‘Raja Oidipous’,
produced ‘Dasachakra’ and ‘Raja’. Through all such activities, Pancham Vaidic
has crossed its sixth year.
Why Mahabharat again? While working with Naathabati Anaathabat all these
years, we felt that this epic is a treasure house of human experience. All the
different levels of life, its complexities are woven into the themes of the

Mahabharata. Hence, we had to take it up once again. Our present production
‘Katha Arnrita Samaan‘ speaks of the moral values, of the right and wrong, of
the horrors of war and its aftermath that were not only true for the characters of
the epic but are true for us as well—the present day man and his society.
It will be a pleasure if our endeavour satisfies you.

Complex, multilevel and multidimensional causes compel one to express
oneself. It is this process that transforms her into the narrator who narrates the
story of Draupadi. But she isn’t a mere narrator of events. The events arouse a
thousand questions in her, so, she poses questions and puts her own
comments while narrating the events. And thus she delves deep into the world
of the Mahabharata.

Looking back from Draupadi, she explores Kunti, Gandhari, Ambika, Ambalika,
Satyabati. Wisdom of Bhisma amazes her. She is intrigued by the character of
Krishna, his playful childhood, his endeavour to build an empire on the basis of
justice or to improve the lot of his clan ending in nothing. The narrator feels the
urge to tell her stories, so she has come. She is grateful to those scholars
whose works on the great epic have served as her sourcematerial.
