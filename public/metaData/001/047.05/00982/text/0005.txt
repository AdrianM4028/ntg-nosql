Probably every single feature of
all Shaw’s characters can be
attributed to his delight in
dislocating our stock associations,
He knowns that we have a
horrible way of taking all the
characteristics of a particular
type and lumping them under a
single head. We picture a usurer

hearted. Shaw does.
As for the hero, Shaw’s less
gifted succssors have developed
his refreshing view that heroes

are not models of good conduct
and that heroism consists of an
impenetrable but exceedingly
lively hotchpotch of the most
contradictory qualities, they
have arrived at the lamentable
conclusion that there is no such
thing as either heroism or heroes,
Probably in Shaw's view this is
unimportant. He seems to ﬁnd,
less point in living among heroes
than among ordinary men.

Shaw's approach to composing
his works is completely aboveboard, He has no hesitation in
writing under the incessant
supervision of the public. To
give extra weight to his
judgments he helps to make that
supervision caster, he keeps
emphasising his own

It is signiﬁcantly hard to ﬁnd

share more or less the same
view, namely that writing is a
meloncholy business. As usual
Shaw, whose views about

anything under the sun are far
from unknown, d’ﬁ'ers from his

colleagues here. (It is not his
fault, but at most an
embarrassment to him, a thorn

in his side, if his vast difference
of opinion with all other
European writers, covering
almost every subject in the
world, is not thrown into
sufﬁciently clear relief because

the others refrain from voicing
their views even when they have

any.) At any rate Shaw Would at
least agree with me on this

point, that he likes writing.
