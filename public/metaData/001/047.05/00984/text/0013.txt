THE PLAYWRIGH'I‘
जो
Eugene O’Neill was born on
October 16, 1888 in New York

city. His father was James
O’Neill, a famous romantic actor,

and thus his infancy and youth
were spent in the atmosphere of
theatre. With brief attempts at
various occupations like that of a
secretary, gold prospector, sailor,
a reporter, all these required a lot
of travelling. It was finally a
touch of tuberculosis, the rest at

a sanitorium that marked the
turning point in his life. At the
age of twenty-four he wrote his
first play. The rest is theatrical
history. American Drama as a
whole came of age with a play
that probes a black man’s social
and racial heritage. O’Neill’s The
Emperor Iones confirmed the
presence in America of a world
dramatist. He has repeatedly
experimented in his work in different forms—Naturalism,

Expressionism, etc. Among the
thirty plays that he has written
the foremost are Long Day ’5 [ourney Into the Night, Emperor lanes,
Beyond the Horizon, The Hairy Ape,
Desire Under the Elms, The Iceman
Cometh, etc. He won the Pulitzer

prize for Drama four times, the
fourth time posthumously (1956),
and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936. He died at the age
of sixty-five in Boston on November 27,1953.
