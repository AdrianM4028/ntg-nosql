Director’s Note

without a narrator or other usual
alienation devices of the epic
theatre. If this production can
mean something beyond simple
entertainment I shall consider

Lu Xun is one of the great writers
of our times and I have a special

liking for his “The true story of
Ah Q”. What excites me most about
the story and also what seems to

be of utmost relevance is the
reﬂection of the simplicistic
confusion of a society in transition
and turmoil. While a select few
strike changes and shape or
distort the events at the apex,
the majority of the common
masses at the base is left high and
dry to draw its own conclusions
and suffer the consequences. As

can be judged by the present
adaptation, the story has a parallel
with the present state of our

society, and therefore, lends itself
to our situations with ease and
authenticity.
Also, from a theatrical point of
view the story affords immense
possibilities for interesting and

varied characters and situations.
In my adaptation and production

I have tried to keep Lu Xun’s
characteristic detachement and
humour, which helps in gaining
a critical view of the whole

situation, intact. The technique
of building montages through
juxtaposition of similar and
contrasting situations and
making the action ﬂuid through
the dissolution of one thing
into the other in quick succession
has helped in achieving this,

my effort a success.
