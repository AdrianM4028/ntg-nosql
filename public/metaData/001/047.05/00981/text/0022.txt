Jokke
After a long period of time. The
terror of German repression in a
devastating war has forced
everyone to alienation. At such
a time Jaganna than managed to
procure some meagre rations
from a shop. Not being a rich
man he was obliged to make his
rations last for several days.
Suddendly a woman appeared
before him from a noisy crowd.
She was Iokke, a very different
Jokke from before.

In this time she had
suffered the violence, insult and

injustice which war had
brought about and was now a
broken person. The Germans had

forced her into prostitution. She
makes Jagannathan's food infit
to eat, yet, he views her action
with kindness. Iokke perceives
the goodness in Jagannathan.
She poisons herself only to be
able to die in front of
Jagannatha n.
Who will be present at one's
death is not a matter of one's
choice. Jokke proves this to be
otherwise. Afraid of death,
angry with God, She is not alone
at the moment of her death.

She had chosen not a stranger
but a good man. At such a choice
of death the fear of it leaves
her and forgiving (30d, she dies.
