WRITER'S NOTE

About communication over

emphasis can be laid an the
diference betwen the East and
West. At one level it may be
more meaningful to speak of
North and South rather than
East and West. Put differently,
the North and South poles and
the band in—between. The

ancient cultures of the East and
West, in this special sense, are
Southern. They have been born
in this middle belt where the
rotation of the seasons is very

specifically seen. In the
tradition of drama this

relationship to the seasons and
nature is equally valid. To give
two fundamental examples

which are essentially
connected with the G reek and
Indian Traditions of Drama,

both having roots in the
'Calend ric Ri tes', with

essential though meaningful
differences—in one, the existence
of drama is not recognised
without 'con fl ict' while there is
no place for it in the other. How
is it so? This is, that all though

the relationship to the rhythm
of the seasons and to nature is
clearly acknowledged in both,
in one, the small and scattered
islands have a special
hazardous concern for survival

with the elernents of nature,
while in the other, the dark

beauty and bounty of earth
gives a different kind of
reassurauce to life. It is the
Indian tradition where 'winter'
and 'Spring' have not been seen
as opposed to each ether. They
have been coupled together and
refered to a twin concept. It is
here that the falling of the old
leaf is seen together with the
sprouting of the new bud. The
English poet has said, "The
hounds of spring in winter's
traces....." almost as if the
hunting hounds of spring are
following winter's footsteps. Or
that, "If winter comes can spring
be far behind ?" It is certainly
not for behind, spring is
following winter and different.
But the Indian sense of time has
not seen them separately. In the
Indian tradition-and in the
tradition of drama, the

affirmation of death is so deep
that it becomes meaningless.
What is death when the leaves
in rot bring forth the new plant?
(Excerpt from the second
convocation address of the
National School of Drama,

delivered by Sri SH.
Va tsyayan Ajneya, on 3rd
February 1966).
