actors were disappointed that
they were not given longer parts,
and this negativity lasted for some
weeks. During this time we began an
important but tedious process of
analysing the play scene by scene.
The aim of this was to appreciate the
sophisticated structure of the work
and to evaluate its content. It
was during this time that we all
realised how inadequate the
translation was compared to the
English treatment. (we could not
work from the French).
Retranslating this 5 act epic was
no mean feat (in fact, translation

work is still proceeding in this ﬁnal
week of rehearsal). It was only
due to a superhuman eHort on the

part of the actors-turned-translators
that we have the present version.

Improvement of the translation was
felt as mandatory by the cast as it
contributes so much to the overall
effect.

The actual rehearsal process
continued during the retranslation.

This is the period I found most
difﬁcult because of my concept of
the production and the manner in
which I work as a director. I
demanded a lot of thought, preparation and innovation from the
actors. I saw myself as the liason
between Rostand and our group
creativity; not as the autocratic ruler.
Work during the rehearsal process
clustered around 3 objectives: to
search for possibilities, to physicalize

and to contribute. The actors and
I looked at all the potentialities
of each scene; never making ﬁnal
decisions but allowing them to

evolve. Whenever we found diﬂiculty

with the writing or acting (or
directing) we tried to ﬁnd a physical
solution to it. By using appropriate
spontaneous movements actors

are able to get in. touch with the
essence of a moment in the play’s
life. And, ﬁnally, I tried to
encourage continuing contributions
of ideas from the cast: 35 creative
minds are better than one!
During the course of this process
I met with the costume and set
designers. After much thought and
many blasted ideas the ﬁnal designs
were arrived at. I think it best for
the set and costumes to speak for
themselves, but their aim is to

complement the style and aspirations
of the production.
