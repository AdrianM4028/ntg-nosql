[Director’s Note

moves the play to a higher realm
where we can at the one time जा
appreciate its pleasure, truth and
beauty.

Cyrano de Bergerac was first performed
in Paris at the turn of the century;
yet it is a play that one can see
without knowing much about the
author or even his time and milieu.
Since its debut the play has been
performed many times by leading
companies (in fact, the Royal
Shakespeare Company has just
begun another successful season in
London this year).
Perhaps the greatest reason for
the continuing popularity of this play
is that it combines entertainment,

beauty and truth. During the course
of the action we see: romance,
comedy, war, death and adventure.

Of course, these are the essential

ingredients for any melodrama or Bgrade movie. But under Rostand’s
guidance we are continually seeing
ourselves in others. There is a
tendancy to recognise universal
aspirations and feelings and to
identify with the various characters.
However, the quality of the work .
does not cease at capturing the
reality of life in a story of advanture.
What adds to these positive
attributes is the use of language.
In the original French Rostand
used the traditional rhetorical 12
syllable line and wrote the whole play
as poetry. This poetic quality
elevates the play from any domestic
interpretation into the world of
fantasy or heightened realism. This
escalation of thought and feeling

Needless to say these are difﬁcult
expectations to fulﬁl on the stage.
For the director, he must ﬁnd an

approach that fulﬁls all these
emotional and philosophic demands
while clearly telling a story. The cast,
designers and I crossed different
stages to arrive at the results of the
present production.
In the ﬁrst instance the cast and
I spent 10 days together, so as to
learn how each other worked and
to spend time on general acting
exercises. During this time class
exercises and improvisations looked
at: non-verbal communication,

' group cohesion, story telling and
destroying stock characterization.
This was a particularly fruitful time
for all of us, as we could begin
from zero and reasses many of our
preconceptions.
Before the actors were handed
the ﬁrst draft of the play they
embarked on research work. Each
group of performers was given a
speciﬁc research topic to present to
the others that had some relevance to
the play that no one had yet read.
These topics varied. From Man’s
Search for Love and Happiness to
Music in 19th Century India to the
Rulers of Lucknow. Again, this
seemed to be a beneﬁcial excercise
since it gave the cast an acedemic
and historical perspective from
which to work.
Casting the play proved to be a
major jolt to the rehearsals. Many
