The Playwright

Edmond Rostand (1868-1918) was
born in Marseilles, France, in a

scholarly family. Although he was
groomed to be a lawyer, his earlier
interest in marionette theatre and
poetry, and his later exposition
to French literature, history and
philosophy ultimately led him
to Follow a literary career which
spans thirty years marked by one
astronomical success and a number

of plays of lesser note.
Rostand’s name gained recognition
with the production of his two
plays Les Romanesques (The
Romancers) and La Princesse
Lointaine (Princess Faraway). His
fame reached its peak in 1898 with

the ﬁrst production of his enormously
successful Cyrano de Bergerac,
a verse drama in ﬁve acts whose
romantic spirit was a departure
from the realistic conventions then
in vogue.
Rostand followed by writing a
number of plays such as L’Az'glon

(The Eaglet), Chanteeler and his
ﬁnal play La Dernz'ere .N'uz't de Don
j’uan (The Last Night of Don
Juan) but none of them except
L’Aiglon succeeded in rousing public
attention.
