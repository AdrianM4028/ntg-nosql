THE ENVIRONMENTS FOR
THE CHERRY ORCHARD

audience as a mass separated from
the event, it creates, for different

groups of spectators, individual
and special relationships of their
own, with the performers, within

the framework of the total
experience.
Richard has for several years
been intensely involved with

the basic nature and structure of
performance relating to different
cultural groups, and his
preoccupation with environmental

staging is more than evident in
his productions and his various

books dealing with these problems.
Six years ago when he saw our
production of Adhe Adhure with the
NSD Repertory in the Studio
theatre, he asked me to design a
production for him when he did a
play in Delhi, and now The Cherry

Orchard becomes a reality.
Over the past few years in my
work with Amal we have gradually '

been moving away from the
limitations of the proscenium stage,
into more ﬂuid spaces like the
basement theatre of the SRC. This
option has led us to explore the
actor-audience relationships in
greater detail and has also radically
altered the scope and problems of
designing—towards the creation
of a scenography that encompasses
the spectator as well as performer.
This ﬂexible arrangement not
only enables the audience to enter

into a common physical experience
of the environment with the ’”
performers, but it also affects the
audience’s visual point of View
of the overall experience. Rather
than approaching the entire

The environment, and the concept
of staging and performance are
inseparably linked, and a very close
interaction between the director
and designer is necessary for

environmental staging to be
successful and evolve into a uniﬁed

totality. The Cherry Orchard therefore
underwent a series of changes
following involved discussions till
ﬁnally, through a process of
moulding, incorporating

performance and design concepts,
we arrived at a ﬁnal form in the ,
production. Richard wanted
the production to be extremely
naturalistic, and yet to visually
encompass a growing contemporary
reality juxtaposed against the past.
Howto visually interpret these
ideas in' terms of visual design,
