characters are drawn from life.
Chekhov the doctor is Chekhov
the author. The peOple in
Chekhov’s plays are not carbon
copies of peOple he knew—but
reconstructed versions. He
combined, and shaded, but he

always stuck pretty close to
his models. For Chekhov enjoyed,
and was compassionate toward,
peeple. He was a genuine doctorthough he also had a temper.

He did not always agree with how
Stanislavski staged his plays.
Chekhov complained that the
MAT emphasized sentimentality
and melodrama. We have tried
to restore a balance between
the obvious tragic dimensions of
The Cherry Orchard and its
more comedic tones.
Chekhov the doctor knew he
was dying in 1902 when he began
writing The Cherry Orchard, his last
play. It was produced in the

Sanislavski played Gayev); and
from the stimulating intellectual
life of the capital. All of Chekhov’s
later plays dwell on the differences
between city and rural life.
The conﬂictng values of old and
new, country and city, traditional
and modern are always present
in Chekhov’s plays. But these
conﬂicts are woven into a richly
coloured fabric of romance, comedy,

pathos, and tragedy.
The Cherry Orchard was written
as Chekhov was dying. But he
was not a man to die in bitterness.
This masterpiece shows a
brightness for life, and a twinkling
smile at it, even as it is ﬁlled

with sadness and ﬁnality at leaving
life. Of this play Stanislavski
wrote: “It was difﬁcult getting
everything right, and no wonder,
for the play itself is a very
difﬁcult one. Its attraction lies

in its elusive, deeply buried

year of his death, 1904. Chekhov’s

fragrance. To smell it you have

illness kept him out of Moscow
for months at a time—he needed
warmer climates. He hated his
separation from his wife Olga
Knipper, a' leading actress with
the MAT (she played Ranevskaya,

to Open the bud, as it were, and
make it ﬂower. But this must
happen of its own accord, without
force, otherwise you will crush

the fragile bloom and it
will die”.
