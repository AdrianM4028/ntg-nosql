beauty with which he continues to
give deeper shades to these emotions.
I was almost mesmerised by its effect.
I approached the work of translating
his plays with that same reverance.
I did not know Russian but wanted

to grasp Chekhov’s original intent
as truthfully as I could. So I
consulted three diﬁ‘erent English
translations of the plays and then
attempted to arrive at the original
meaning of each sentence. The
Moscow translation was my base.
I heard later that the translations
were appreciated by readers, well
received by institutions and the radio
and also included in text books.

However, I feel today that these
translations of twenty-ﬁve years ago
need much editing from the stage
and performance viewpoints.
Their language can be made
crisper, more effective and
performable. I am happy that
the NSD Repertory Company has
selected Cherry K'a Baghz'cha
and has worked upon it. I am
sure that the accomplished actors
of the company will do their

best to effectively bring out the
dramatic genius of Chekhov who
is a source of inspiration to most
theatre workers and writers
even today.
