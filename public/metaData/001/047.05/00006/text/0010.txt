He doesn’t just “have” money

the old aristocratic landowners
are losing their money and with it
their grip on things. A new
capitalist class is rising, buying up
everything and turning it to proﬁt.
Also there are stirrings among the
young, the idealists—those who
reject both feudalism and capitalism
—-—of a utopian socialism: the brand
of socialism not typiﬁed by Stalin

but more by the young Lenin and
Trotsky. Chekhov has not written
a political play as Brecht might
have, but he has given The Cherry
Orchard deﬁnite ideological
tendencies.
Ranevskaya, Gayev, and especially

Feers are of the feudal order: they
are passing away; Lopakhin and
his admirer Yasha (a servant with

Trofimov, joined by Anya, sees a
new socialist possibility. Troﬁmov
is a utopian, but admirable

and Anya go Off together in search
of that utopian socialist future.
(The rest of the twentieth century
demonstrates the difﬁculties of
their quest.)
The play ends with the Orchard
being cut down: for whatever the
future will be the past is gone. The
house is locked up, Feers locked
inside it. Everyone. else is off to
different lives: one carriage but
many tomorrows.

It’s almost as if his clinic has drawn
to it a whole community and he,
the doctor, has heard their intimate

tales of triumph, woe, and Ordinary
happenings. Chekhov’s mind is not
doctrinaire. He sees and he writes
about what he sees. His characters
do not work their way through
tragedy to illumination. They have,

each of them—Pishchik and
Dunyasha, Varya and Yepikhodov
—-——as much as the so-called “main”
characters—unique and for them
very important experiences.
These experiences are ﬁne or
