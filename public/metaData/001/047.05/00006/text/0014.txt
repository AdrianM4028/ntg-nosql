gave rise to a range of interesting
possibilities.
The Open-Air theatre at
Rabindra Bhavan provided a nearperfect space for the production
and Richard needed no convincing
to okay it, since it provided a
varied range of environments all
within a single Space. The problem
then was of locating the different

acts within this total space. The
one major change that took place
at this stage, was the shifting of the
Act 1/4 from the region of the
well behind the actual stage, onto
the stage itself. We had wanted
to avoid the stage and auditorium
but it became extremely difﬁcult to

adjust Act 1 in the small space
around the well. Richard felt that
the shift would give him more scope
for Act 4 as “ell. which could be
played from the back of the stage —-~
and he could use this portion as

other~ nursery, living room, Anya’s

room etc.—-—as well as occur
simultaneously in different parts
of the house orchestrated to bring
out the main focus of action. A
simpler working arrangement
was ﬁnally decided upon by using
the nursery and the living room, so
that one could get glimpses of
the aetion in the living room
in Act 1 and that of the nursery
in Act 4, since the audience

positions were reversed in these
two acts.
Landscaping the cherry orchard
with trees, mud and grass, and
linking it to the house flowed along
the natural path from the stage
to the grove behind. Act 2
was ﬁnalized in this region. Act 3
is the climax, and I felt the

strongest visual statement of
modernity was needed here It is

also here that the crucial point

the main entrance of the house,

of the impending change actually

whereas the room facing the
auditorium be used as the back
of the house.
The shift from the small space
over the well, to the expanse of the

takes place from the decadent
the contemporary reality of
Lopakhin. I felt that the set here
should have a formalistic

auditorium, and the naturalistic

quality incorporating into it a

framework of the production,
brought to my mind the possibility
of building a house with several

sense of modernity without losing

small rooms on two levels,

a resolution of the dying past. I

some open to audience view and

had wanted to use a stronger visual

the others shut off, so that we’d

metaphor and a different idiom of
expression for the ﬁnal closing up

really be able to use the house as a
real one, and be able to extend the
naturalistic sense to an extreme

degree This could also lead
to the stretching of the action into
different rooms and choreograph it
to ﬂow from one room to the

outlook of Renevskaya’s world, to

its base in reality.
Act 4, then in retrospect, comes as

of the house, and cover it with

a huge canvas sheet into a bundle,
tied with thick rope. At one stage
early in the production, Richard felt
that instead of closing the house,

it could gradually be broken down
