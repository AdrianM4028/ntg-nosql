the experience of the performers

your mind: to “go with” the story,

not to merely “see” or “hear”
the story.
The theory of environmental
theatre is to construct spaces,

warm-up exercises themselves are
taken from modern dance and
ideokinesis. Ideokinesis is a
technique for establishing neuromuscular coordination. Centering

the native American peoples
of Arizona and elsewhere. So in
participating in this experiment
here you are also doing something
very old and traditional.
