more like a negotiation among the
various elements that are alchemized
into a living production. First
among these. for me, are the
performers. Not mere “actors” who
work hard to pretend or actually
(for the time being) become others
called characters. But “performers”
who are persons always conscious

of their own identities: as Surekha
Sikri as well as Mme. Ranevskaya,

owner of the Orchard. Let me be
clear about what I mean. The
fun in rehearsing for me (and I
trust, for the people working with
me) is to ﬁnd the points of contact

painstaking practice. And much
basic training in vocal and body
articulation. There is never enough
time. But theatre is pitiless: a play
is seen by audiences who get what
they get and that’s all. I believe
this is proper—but I also believe
that the theories that underly the
practice are of some interest:
because the process of making a
work is to me every bit as important
as the ﬁnal product. In this regard
we have spent a lot of time

“training” rather than rehearsing.
The deﬁ‘erence IS that training is
meant to liber up the performers’

between who they actually are and

bodies, voices and awareners:

the story they are telling. These
points of contact are authentic: no
false tears or laughter, no pretended
anger: but the careful construction
over as long a period of time as
rehearsals allow of a concrete
“performance score”. This score is
some-thing like a progression of

moves (blocking) and speciﬁc

preparing for a speciﬁc production.

hours learning about their bodies,

This work is never ﬁnished, and

among the performers—particular
interactions that are discovered
during rehearsals and made into the
performances you are seeing now.

foundation on which the product

What of this product—as a play,

These relations and interactions are

ideas? As I said before a production

“actual”—-they are not pretended,

elements—not only the play as the

only what they appear to be.
That is: they are the gestures,
moves, and relationships necessary
for this group of people——the

performers—to tell and share a
Story with another group of
people—the spectators. That’s all
there is to it: but to achieve this

example of literature. (I don’t know

Chekhov’s prose.) The story is set

the turn of the century in a small
town in rural Russia. In this place
