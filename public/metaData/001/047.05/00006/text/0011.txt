So ﬁnally The Cherry Orchard is a
whole social world: a very deep

and dense network of relationships
that express emotions, ideologies,

social classes, change, and the
inability to recognize no less accept
change. Chekhov appears to refrain
from making judgments. 80 shall I.
Environmental Theatre &
This Production

A play is not only what you see

but what you do and where you
do it. As a director in the style of

"environmental theatre” I try to
provide each spectator with her or
his unique experience. There is
no “best seat”. In act IV there are
hardly any seats at all. The idea is
to have you share the environments

where The Cherry Orchard

Troﬁmov, Raneskaya and Anya in the
Moscow Art Theatre production of

The Cherry Orchard directed by Stanlslavsky

takes place: to give the story a

three dimensional feel. Working
with environmentalist Nissar Allana,

and a devoted crew of carpenters
and technicians, as well as with

di rector-cum— costumer
Amal Allana, the perfOrmers and
I have attempted to create a
full world of the whole precinct of
The Cherry Orchard.
We offer you the Ranevskaya
house, and the orchard, and a

for mal garden where the dance
and party of act III takes place.
For the ﬁrst act the audience
is seated part in the Meghdoot
Theatre and part along one side
of its stage. You can see into
the house and beyond it to the
Orchard. In act II we move
to the Orchard itself and the

action takes place on two sides of
the spectators—in amidst the trees
and alongside an old well and
shrine. For act III we move to a
formal garden behind the
Meghdoot where Ranevskaya
is giving a big party on the night

of the auction of the Orchard. And
in act IV everyone moves to the
front of the house, facing the
Orchard (now being chopped
down) to stand in the yard
watching the family and friends
and others pack up and leave the
house forever. Some of the
action takes place inside the house
whose walls are now in place;
and some of the action takes place
on the porch, in the yard and in
the Orchard.
