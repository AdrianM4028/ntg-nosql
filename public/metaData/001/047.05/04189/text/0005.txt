a reasoning attitude were being
exploited. In such a situation,
Brecht’s theatre was to assume the
signiﬁcance of a revolutionary
act.

The themes he utilized sought to
look at life in it’s true colours, so as

to enable man to discern the causes
of social, and therefore emotional

injustice. Such themes began to
dictate the form of his plays.
He realized that the form too should

new at that time, must have had a
strong bearing on his concepts.
Brecht felt it necessary to see events
in historical perspective, i.e. as a
process of change, where the fate of
man is man, not Destiny. The
element of supense was eliminated
as it caused one to await the
outcome, rather than concentrate
on the process. The causes (why) and

the manner (how) of resolving a
complex situation were more

important and interesting than the
have about it a ‘no—nonsense’,
unsentimental, critical and
reasoning approach. He rejected

outcome (what), as they revealed

the nature of human relationships.
He stressed this ‘how’ and ‘why’

the three-act form as obsolete, and

substituted it with a scenic (episodic)

form. The three-act structure lent
itself to the slow unwinding of
private, intimate responses, whereas

the one-short-scene-upon-another
gave scope for the unfolding of
large, widespread, panoramic social
actions, which could encompass
the showing of relevant segments
consequitively. These could be
juxtaposed and montaged in such a
way so as to reveal the existing

in every aspect of his dramatic
approach, and it became the key-note
to his ideas on a new acting style,
which would relate to the new
form.

A divorcing of the self from the
role, a demonstrative attitude of
‘showing’, rather than a subjective
attitude of ‘feeling’ emerged. The
actor was now to play ‘the situation'

conﬂicts concurrently. Sharp dramatic

rather than involve himself with
playing ‘character’, or assuming
‘characteristics’. Brecht felt that

contrasts could also be achieved
in this way. Such a ﬂuid sense
of dramatic structure makes one

human beings reacted very differently,
and often in diametrically opposing
ways in dilferent situations. For
