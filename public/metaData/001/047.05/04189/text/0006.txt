the good docile wife, like the
adultress. Changed circumstances
were responsible for differing
reSponseS. Therefore neither
human beings nor situations were
viewed as perennial, but held

the possibility of change. That
Shen-te is also Shui-ta, that Galy
Gay is also the Human Fighting
Machine, that Mother Courage is a
mother as well as the person who

sells her children, amply illustrates
the point.
The logical conclusion to these ideas
was, that it was no longer possible

for the theatre to remain a peep-hole
to illusion, but to be the platform
where a job is in progress. The
actors were performers, the stage
hands did their work in the open,

the sets revealed their ‘canvas’ and
‘paint’ quality. In short reality
was seen for itself! The constant

change of scenes interSpersed with
songs helped to break a continuous
emotional involvement. The singers
spoke to the audience directly,

as did the actors.
To be able to convey the meaning
and idea of this kind of theatre
which spoke in a new dramatic
language of social reality and was
geared to social change, Brecht
needed co-workers committed to the

same approach, where theatre no
longer remained an isolated aspect
of their lives. He was fortunate
in having the collaboration of
like-minded theatre personalities of

an extremely high calibre. Gifted
actors, designers and composers
joined him in laying the foundations
of the Berliner Ensemble which
was to become the most eminent

theatre centre of the Western world.
It saw classic productions of
Brecht’s plays, and it was through
these, that the dissemination of
his ideas occured, and an assessment
made of his genius.
His style at once resembles the

magnitude of Shakespeare in
panoramic sweep; the inﬁnite

attention to detail as in a Breugel
painting, and the brevity and
austerity of expression as found
in the work of the cartoonist,

George Grosz. Like a cartoonist,
Brecht possesses biting humour and
the ability to relate the individual
to the larger canvas of his times.

, In his work one ﬁnds the excitement
of taking sides, as in a boxing

match. But above and beyond all
this Brecht’s commitment was to
human dignity which sprang from
the compassion he felt for man.
