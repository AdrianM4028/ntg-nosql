brother-in-law the new Kotwal.
The Sipahi sees that the poor
Hawaldar, who is rightfully entitled
to the Kotwal’s post and waiting
for his promotion in order to marry
Mainavati, has become a victim

of this “family promotion” system.
He sets off to give this news to the
Hawaldar.
Mainvati, impatient to get married
to the Hawaldar, wonders when

he will be promoted. The Hawaldar
assures her that their dreams will
soon be realised, for the Kotwal is

on his death-bed. Happy with this
news, Mainavati sings and dances
for him. The Sipahi arrives with

news of the Kotwal’s death. The
Hawaldar directs Mainavati to
prepare for their wedding.
The Hawaldar and the Sipahi are

charms. He becomes her daily
visitor, bringing her many priceless
gifts stolen from the palace.
The Hawaldar, Mainavati and the

Sipahi wonder at Maharaj’s
complete unawareness of the
numerous thefts. They decide that

this time Mainavati shall demand
the royal bed, for this theft would
surely be noticed by Maharaj.
The Kotwal, reluctant to lose
Mainavati, ﬁnally agrees to her

demand. He orders the Sipahi to
fetch the royal bed. The Hawaldar
is ordered to make arrangements

for the Kotwal‘s marriage to
Mainavati. The royal bed arrives
- but the humble hut is not large

enough to receive it Consequently

on their way to the Kotwal’s funeral.

it is hidden in a haunted house.
Maharaj notices the theft of his
royal bed and is extremely put out.

The Sipahi reveals Pradhanji’s plot

Pradhanji’s suggestion that a royal

to make his brother-in-law the next

ghost may have committed the
theft ﬁnally calms Maharaj down
and he commands that a new bed
be made immediately.
The Hawaldar reveals the truth of
the matter to Maharaj and urges
him to visit the haunted house in

Kotwal. The Hawaldar‘s hopes are
dashed to the ground. He realises
that honesty does not pay and that

he will now have to resort to devious
means. The Sipahi pledges his help
and support.

Preparations are being made for
the new Kotwal who is due to
arrive. Shortly, yelling as if driving
a herd of cattle, the new Kotwal

appears. Upon learning that the
new Kotwal is a music-lover, the

Hawaldar makes a scheme to trap
him and persuades him to listen to
Mainavati‘s song, to which he
readily agrees. The Hawaldar goes
directly to Mainavati and tells
her of his plan.

The amorous Kotwal mistakes
Sakhya f'or Mainavati and f'aints
from the shock. Soon, however, he is

revived and captivated by Mainavati’s

disguise where the Kotwal‘s wedding
ceremony is going to be performed.
Maharaj, disguised as a brahmin,
visits the scene of the wedding and
performs the marriage ceremony.
After the wedding he asks the
Kotwal where he found his beautiful

bride. In a delirium ofjoy the
Kotwal reveals the truth Maharaj
orders the Kotwal to be executed,
; but the bride, who is actually

३ Sakhya, begs that her husband‘s
life be spared. Maharaj grants her
I wish. He appoint the Hawaldar as
the new Kotwal, and blesses him
and Mainavati.
