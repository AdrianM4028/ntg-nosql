A NOTE BY THE
DIRECTOR
unfolds the theme, which

though built on traditional stories
of kings and queens, reaches out

to include a wide spectrum of
contemporary social, political and
administrative problems. and
provides, through the dialogne, an
intelligent and often caustic
commentary on subjects close to
the everyday life of the audience,

thereby securing close audience
participation in the action. The
content of the songs have
contemporary references and very
often border on the risque. They

are naughty without being vulgar.
Excellent team-work, histrionic

versatility, ready wit and the ability
The Tamas/1a is a representative
Folk Theatre form of the people of

Maharashtra. It is a happy, artistic
blend of dance and music, marked
by robustness and vigour of the
spoken word. Lavam’ sangeet and
Nritya are the core of its artistic

to improvise-all help in the total

artistic achievement.
The theme of the Tamas/Ia which
we have chosen to present tonight
revolves around a Hawaldar, who
though honest and efficient in the
discharge of his duties, consistently

expression. Every Tamas/1a has
three clearly marked movements

fails to secure promotion. After

called Gana, Gwalain Swang and
Vaga around which the action

succeed through honest means, he
learns his lesson the hard way.
Taking recourse to a more practical,
albeit questionable stratagern, he

is centred. The ﬁrst is the
opening invocation to Lord

Ganesha. This is invariably followed
by the episode depicting Lord
Krishna sporting with the gwaluns
or milkmaids. Allusions to
contemporary events and personalities ﬁgure prominentlv in the
dialogues between Lord Krishna
and the milkmaids. This scene
is marked by exchanges of wit and
repartee, rich music and colourful
dancing. The third movement

being baulked in his efforts to

turns the tables on the corrupt

Kotwal and the stupid King.
The play, like all Tamas/ms, has

a certain immediacy which is
universally appealing. Though not
fully developed, the chief ﬁgure of

the Hawaldar is truly representative
of common man in contemporary
society and voices his frustrated
aspirations and helplessness, in an
unjust and inequitable social order.
