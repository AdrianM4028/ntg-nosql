We are grateful to Dr. Satish Chandra and Prof. M .A. Ansari for their kind

guidance regarding the social and political background of the play, and to

Shri Robin Das and Shri T.L. Sharma for their suggestions with the set
design.

We are also grateful to Shri Gopi Gajwani for helping us in the designing
of our publicity material.
