A NOTE FROM THE
ADAPTOR

inebriated he becomes human,

दृ

relapsing into his mother-tongue,

हुं

oozing sympathy for his fellow beings l

i
and supporting the proletariat’s
causes of social justice and equality. l
The driver Jamaal, Matti’s Indian

counterpart, comes from a lowermiddle-income group. Although not
committed to any speciﬁc ideology,

he is fully aware of the social realities
and relationships of his times.
The adaptation retains a balance
between the class—antagonism of
Chopra and Jamaal. To make an
effective contrast between the two,

Chopra’s language rings with harsh
sounds while Jamaal’s has the ﬂow
of simple Urdu.
The diplomat, Mr. Gulati, is another
important character whose presence

is a foil to the class-characteristics
and attitudes of other major

characters. The language of this
Though the servant—master class

elite son-in-law endeavours to reﬂect

‘ conﬂict is universal in a capitalistic
society, the basic objective of

his hollowness and hypocrisy.
The judge, the lawyer and the priest
are products of the petit bourgeoisie

democratic writing is to localise and
adapt a situation so that it is

readily identiﬁable by the ‘local’
man. Thus the Finnish setting
of Mr. Puntila and his Man Matti

has been transformed into an
Indian scene localised in Mehrauli.

This play is more relevant in
India than anywhere in Europe
because nowhere else are feudalism
and capitalism so ﬁrmly rooted

despite the industrial progress.
Chopra, the Indian Puntila, is

steeped in feudalistic attitudes and
a rising bourgeois. He is a product
of feudal traditions and nuveauriche Punjabi culture. When cold
sober, he reverts to his inhuman

self, expressing his cruelty in
Hindustani and English. But when

who use Chopra to further their

ends. Their language has a formal
quality.
The language of the four singing
laughing women from the lower

and lower middle class of Haryana
reﬂects their earthy simplicity
through the use of Haryanvi,
Punjabi and common Hindi.
The songs endeavour to give an

eye-witness account of the episodes
on the stage as well as to establish
direct communication with the
spectator.

This is Brecht’s second play that
I have adapted. The ﬁrst was “Lux
In 'I‘enebris” which I adapted and
directed under the title of
“Nishachar” in 1976.
