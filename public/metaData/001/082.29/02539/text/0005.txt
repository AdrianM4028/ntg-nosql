It isfrom this that adventures of culture-heroes were written. The plays adhered
to the unity of time, place and action. There was the Protagonist the main character
of the play and an Antagonist, a secondary main character. The conflict in the drama
was between the Protagonist and the Antagonist.

The tragic actor wore a mask. It ”s features were enggerated and emphasised in
shape and colour could be seen more plainly across the vast distance of theatres seating
very often as many as 15,000 spectators. The wide open mouths are supposed to have
permitted the use of some sort of meghaphone to increase the power of the actors’
voices. The actors costume was a long garment reaching from neck to ankles called
the ‘CHITON’. He also wore an enaggerated headress, the ‘ONKOS’ and thick-soled
shoes. ‘ KOTHURNUS ’. The chorus wore low chiton and wore no mask.
Costumes for comedy were in current style, usually low chiton, except for gods
and mythological characters.
MACHINES : These were the ‘ECCYCLEMA’ and the ‘ MECHA NE ’ . The
Eccyclema was some device whereby the result of the interior action such as dead
bodies after a murder could be shown. It might have a platform upon which a throne
is set and rolled out. It is not known whether it was on wheels or moved on an axis.
The mechane consisted of a hook and pulley set at the very top of the skene to the left
hand side of the stage. By its means divinities could be raised or lowered.

NOTE ON E U R| P I D ES
E URIPIDES : He was born in 486 BC in the region, or on the island, ofSalamis

and some ofhis contemporaries maintained that his parents were shopkeepers. Euripides
beginnings may have been humble—there is no certain documentation—but he is one
of the great names ofEuropean literature, and in his own time he earned the admiration
of no less a man than Socrates. As far as our information goes, Erupides seems to
‘ have been a retiring man by nature, though he held the priesthood oneus at Phyla
for a time, and was a member of an embassy sent to Syracuse by Athens. He lived to
