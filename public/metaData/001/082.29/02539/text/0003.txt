MEDEA A SYNOPSIS
The’ scene is Corinth, before the house of Jason, and the play begins with
the Nurse reﬂecting on Medea’s plight.

Her mistress, the Nurse says, is beside herself at the news that Jason now
rejects her. She has even turned against their sons who have also been rejected by
Jason now that he has married Glauce, daughter of the King of Corinth. The Nurse
is uneasy about Medea’s brooding —— she knows her mistress can be a formidable
enemy.
The children and their Tutor come back to the house from a walk in the city.
The Tutor alarms the Nurse by telling her what he has heard in the market place ——
that King Creon intends to banish Medea from Corinth. The Nurse implores the
Tutor to keep the rumour to himself — such news would drive her mistress to
some terrible deed.

The women of Corinth await Medea. When she emerges from the house
and addresses them they understand her anxiety more clearly. She is not just being
abandoned by a faithless man; she is not a Hellene and neither she nor her children
will have any rights or protection. The King arrives with his guard to banish Medea
himself; he knows that she is a sorceress and wants her out of Corinth that very
hour. Medea pleads on her children’s behalf and gains a small grain of compassion.
Creon gives her one more day; after that her life is forfeit.
After Creon has left Medea recalls her own royal blood; she is a king’s daughter, of the line of the sun god, Helios. And she is more than a match for Jason,

who arrives next. He has brought money for her and the children to make their
