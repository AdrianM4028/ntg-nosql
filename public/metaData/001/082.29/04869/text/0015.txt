The rescue of captive Sita from Lanka, the
kingdom of Havana, as narrated in the great
epic Ramayana, is the opening scene of the
puppet play Sita. Sita in exile, her twin sons
Lava and Kush and the great sage Valmiki are
its principal characters. Lava and Kush have
been projected here as an ideal example of
how young children can be brought up in

perfection under the influence of a noble
mother and teacher in ideal surroundings.
Children of today will shape the world of
tomorrow and if their physical and mental
growth is not complete in all respects, the
future world will be a cursed one unworthy to
live in. This is the message projected through
the ideal characters of Lava and Kush in this
puppet play based on the popular epic, the
Ramayan.
Sita, the queen of Ayodhya, lives here in a
hermitage without any royal grandeur, like
any other mother living ordinarily in poverty.
“an be realised from her instance, that no
royal splendour or special riches are required
to groom a child ideally. Living in a cottage,
she has instilled an eagerness for learning and
many other human qualities in her sons, Lava
and Kush. There is an ideal atmosphere in the
hermitage where man can live in an inseparable unity with nature and the animal world,
his mind and soul ﬁnd a serene climate for
free expression. The great spiritual teacher
Valmiki made Lava and Kush adept in the art
of warfare and at the same time instilled
wisdom with the knowledge of the scriptures
and other sciences. They learnt from him that
mastery of weapon is required only to resist a
wrong and unjust act, and also received the
deep knowlege required for the development
of life with self—realisation.
पों' d Ramachandra, while on the throne of
dehya, performs the solemn ritual of the

merges with the mother earth, a realisation
suddenly enlightens the mind of Lava and
Kush. Their mother and motherland appear to
be one and the same! The play ends with the
following words in the inspiring voice of the
narrator:

‘Rise and be firm, go ahead with your duty;
your mother is mingled with this land, bow
down your heads here and your obeisance will
reach your mother’s feet. Make this world
graceful and strive for its peace and prosperity
your mother will be gratified and be proud of
you. The mother and the motherland are superior to heaven — even the kingdom of Cod!’
