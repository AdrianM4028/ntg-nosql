A few words about the story...

King Dharmasekhara banishes his senior
queen for being childless. The helpless
queen, concealing her pregnancy, accepts the
banishment and lives in penury in a hut out—
side the city with the help of the minister. The
boy born to her is named Lakshapathi and he
grows up to be a strong and virtuous young

man. In response to the King’s proclamation,
Lord Shiva comes down to the earth and asks
for six miraculous objects to be given to him
in six months. The four notorious princes,

sons of the junior queen, go out in quest of
these objects hoping to get the throne for
themselves.

Lakshapati’s identity is revealed and he too
sets out on the back of a divine lame horse in
pursuit of these gifts. Adventures follow and
the efforts of the wicked princes to kill their
brother are foiled. At last, Lakshapathi Raja
. _ cures these miraculous objects, as also a
divine bride who is in possession of these objects, and returns. He becomes the King and
the four brothers are posted as guards of the
kingdom’s frontiers.
And now a few words on the form...

Jogerata is one of the oldest folk form of

rural northern Karnataka. Attempts are being
made to revive this long—neglected rich and
versatile folk form. Unlike other folk forms _
Jogerata has the unique distinction of being
able to imbibe elements of other forms
smoothly, without damaging its individuality
when brought to proscenium theatre.
In the play Lakshpathi Rajana Kathe this
aspect is proved by the director successfully
by adopting elements and techniques from
other theatre forms without effecting the ori—
ginal Jogerata form.
In Jogerata, the emphasis is on entertain-

ment, though at times it carries a message or a
moral. It is a predominantly narrative form
employing song and dance in abundance.
The musical instruments used in this play are
a rarity and almost on the verge of extinction.
Kinnari an instrument which is used by jogis
can also be played like the veena. Hence the
form is called Kinnari Jogerata. Instru—
ments like gajjara are used to adorn bulls’
horns and dammadi is made out of buffalo’s
hide. Though simple instruments, they are

enchanting. Having studied this form int‘en- 4
sively for a year, this was brought to the pros—
cenium with the courtesy of the Central
Sangeet Natak Akaderni, New Delhi.
