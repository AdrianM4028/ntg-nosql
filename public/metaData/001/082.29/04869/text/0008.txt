which he is one of the founder
members): Cardinal Inquisitor in
Galileo and Macbeth in Macbeth. He
has also acted under veteran
directors like Damoo Kenkre

(Vandha). He has codirected Galileo
with Arun Naik and Magova with

Sanjay Mone. He has also done music
scores for productions like Milli
Papni and Magova. Ajit Bhure is
essentially an experimentor in both
content and form, a fact which is

borne out from the various plays
directed by him: Anahat, a
performance based on the dialogues
of the Rigveda which tried to
amalgamate several traditional Indian
classical and semi—classical
performance modes; Galileo, a
production in the Brechtian style
depicting the dilemna of a scientist;
and Magova, a quasi-naturalistic
social play dealing with the problem
of the commercialisation of the artist
in today’s society.
