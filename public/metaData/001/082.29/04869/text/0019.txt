This is a one-woman show. Tijanbai sings,
dances, enacts and narrates the tale of the
Mahabharata in the Pandwani-ballad-

singing style.

Sabalsingh Chauhan’s Mahabharat is the
base of all Pandwani-ballad performances,
but Tijanbai’s presentation has a distinct
mark of its own. Several characters from Kunti to Draupadi and Kichaka to Bhima come
live on stage. Love-scenes and battle-scenes
are enacted and comments are made on the
Gita! The otherwise plain and simple Tijan—
bai becomes extremely attractive on stage.
Clad in the typical Chattisgarhi saree, a big
tika on her forehead and vermilion in her
bhang, traditional ornaments like the surra
in her neck, pahunchi on her arm, twelve
bangles, kakni and chura in her hands, the

nine-stringed kardhan on her waist, payal in
her feet, chapahi mundri in her ears, with

paan-red lips, Tijanbai dazzles on stage. And
there is an ektara in her hands! It is ofcourse
a musical instrument, but for Tijanbai and her
audiences it is also Bhima’s gada and Arjun’s
Gandiva Dhanushya!
Tijanbai expresses herself through her voice,
her eyes, her body. Even the language she
uses is her own. There is a boldness, a sense

of freedom in whatever she does. Her Kichaka
uses language and gestures which would scandalize the sophisticated, urban audiences!
Her sense of performance is so sharp, that she
can instantly improvise and adjust herself
according to the performing—time available.
Tijanbai does not merely tell story. She does
something which falls into the realm of
genuine theatre.
