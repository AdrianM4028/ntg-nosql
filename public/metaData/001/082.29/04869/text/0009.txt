The play is based on the Sanskrit world classic Mrucchakatikam by Shudraka. Being
extremely modern and progressive in spirit,
the play has immense contemporary rele—
vance. A complete cross-section of society is
revealed with its entire complex hierarchical
structure and an optimistic plea for equality is
also made. Yet, the play does not become a
mere prosaic statement. It incorporates the
lyrical and the dramatic elements and goes on
to unfold an epic span.
The translation is interpretative. The title,
whose importance remains unapparent in the

original play, suggests a powerful and apt imagery and gives rise to the leitrnotif of this
interpretative version. The interwoven irnag—

As far as sheer theatricality is concerned, the

Music in the play does not attempt a recreation of the period. Percussion is used
sparingly. There is an innovative use of
voices. Harmonic blends of voices create a
drone background in some places, while lending colour to certain situations. The vrunda
(chorus) sings in duet or quartet commenting
on the narrative, as well as generalising the
dramatic.
The costumes too, are not rigidly authentic.
Several kinds of variedly patterned, textured
and draped fabrics try to bring out the character, mood and theme of the play.
The acting style can be loosly described as
stilted naturalistic or mellowed stylized.
The performance tries to create a blend of all
kinds of styles, conventions and techniques
that might be useful — it is unauthentic and
impure, it is open and flexible.
The greatness of Mrucchakatikam needs no
proof. But great works of art need to be reinterpreted in the context of the aesthetics of
our modern sensibilities — this is the goal be—

play is unsurpassable. The plethora of diverse
characters, the lucid admixture of pun-filled
and poetic, witty and solemn language, the
simultaneous bifocal scenes, the intriguing
intricacy of the plot, the shifts and jumps in
time and space, the combination of the rustic
and the sophisticated in the comprehensive
homogenous texture, the contribution of various inseparable theatre elements —— all this
makes the play a true challenge for the performers.
