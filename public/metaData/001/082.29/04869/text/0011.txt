The ancient oral epic traditionally known as
Chandaini in Chhattisgarh, Loriki in eastern
U.P. and Lorikayan in Bihar, depicts the
extraordinary love between Chanda or Chandra, a married woman, and Lorik, a married

man. The former title celebrates the heroine
and the latter two, the hero.

Hazariprasad Dwivedi in his novel, traces the
legend to Mricchahatikam’s character Aryak,
a cowherd. According to him, the name Gopal
Aryak was abbreviated by people to Loarik
and with common usage finally become Lorik.
The legend is undoubtedly very old, as borne
out by the paintings relating to Lorik and
Chandra found in the museums of Benaras
and Chandigarh. From Mithila to U.P. and
Chhattisgarh, it is still sung by the Ahirs —
cowherds who till the land and deal in milk
or, as in Chhatisgarh, by Sotuamis and other
Bathia, a cowherd:

castes.

.iterary works are created out of this oral tale
right from 14th to 20th century, for instance
in Hindi, Chandrayan in 1379 and Mainasta in the 17th century, in Deccani, Gavvasir’s
Malna Satwanti about the same time, and in
Persian, Hameed’s Astamatnama in 1607.

Our play owes its inspiration to Chandaini
not Lorikayan. In essence, it tells the same
story, but in editing the rich sprawling
legend, we had many choices.

We have used our choice in projecting certain
elements as against certain others. For instance the pastoral element of the story suited
our purpose, so we have integrated cattle
more closely with human characters.
Bidesia is the predorninent style in singing in
Lorikayan while Chandaini has its own
peculiar style and tunes. The Chandainiballadeer takes several evenings to unfold his
tale, to tell you the story in full he requires 18
sessions and sometimes more, just like the
Pandavani—balladeer of Chattisgarh performing his Mahabharata. Usually he is
supported by four or five musicians, who play
their instruments and provide the vocal re—
frain, while the main artiste sings, narrates
and dances his story. In this respect also, the
form resembles Pandavani. The only differ-

damentally the same, many events and small

variously called Chandi Malagar signifying
