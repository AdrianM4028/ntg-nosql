Umbhangam, noted for its pathos, fury and
heroism is a rare specimen of tragedy in the
Indian concept. It is poignant with human
emotions. An episode from Mahabharata
depicting the death of Duryodhana is recreated for theatre by the great playwright Bhasa.

Here in this production it is attempted to rerecreate this theme by creating two Duryodhanas — one is Duryodhana the war-monger and
the other his theyyam which we may call
‘Suyodhana’ — suggesting the good qualities in
him which spring out from him at the moment
his thighs are fatally broken by Bhimsena. 0f
the two-fold aspect of the hero, the mundane
one is the mortal existence of Duryodhana
struggling under the pangs of death; the other
being his spirit, which unveils a supernatural
dimension and is projected in his theyyam.
Theyyam literally means daivam or godhead. It can be his death itself. It is the spirit
7 .lf-released from the wounded‘Duryodhana;

is own conscience advocating all his higher
qualities.

Here is a war hero who decidedly stood for
adharma all through his life. But suddenly
he realises that his belief was wrong. The mo—
ment he faces the inevitable finale of his life
and when he is turned out to be a lump of
clay, he looks back. Even in him the feelings

of dhamm dawn. This is represented by the
theyyam.

When the war continues to be fought in and
around Duryodhana, he realises its futility.
But how can he spell it out? He himself has
unleashed the devil forces. Now it is too late
to withdraw his own commitment.
He succumbs to his doom even as his own son

Durjaya and his retinue march on to the goal
he once cherished.

A word about Dhritarshtra.
Is he blind?
Yes — but no.
His blindness is described

sons.)
His love for his children has evidently made
