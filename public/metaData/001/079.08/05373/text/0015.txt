This’ play is a Hindi translation of Sartre’s Respectable
Prostitute. The drama is set in the United States and deals
with the racial tension in the South America. Lizzie, a white
prostitute has witnessed murder of Negro by a white man is
compelled to accuse the murdered Negro and his companian
of raping her and to state that the white in defending her, shot
one Negro, but that another escaped. The town forms a lynch
—hunt for the escaped Negro, who hours later seeks refuge at
Lizzie's house, and after being discovered escapes once more.
The play poses tremendous moral crisis in which the distiny of
a Negro and a white prostitute is same,

Production design of the play is realistic,
