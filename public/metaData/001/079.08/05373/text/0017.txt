and

rneaninglessness, Waiting for Godot is for the very first time
presented in Chattisgarhi a major dialect of Madhya Pradesh
and perheps, for the first time in any dialect.
The action of the play is simple to relate. Two Tramps Didi
and 6090 are waiting by a tree for the arrival of Mr. Godot.
They quarrel, contemplets suicide, try to sleep, eat a carrot and
gnaw on some chicken bones. Two other characters appears, a
master and a slave(Pozzo and Lucky) who perform a grotesque

scene in the middle of the play. A young boy arrives to say
that Mr. Godot. will not come today, but that he will come
tomorrow. the play is development of the title Waiting for
Godot. Godot does not come and the two tramps resume their
vigil by the tree, which between the first and second day
sprouted a few leaves, the only symbol of possible order in ‘a
thoroughly alienated world.
This production is the latest example of presenting a play
in a dialect. It points to an entirely new ground too. The
production uses the elements of Chattisgarhi folk theatre style,
NAKAL While the version retains the origainal genuiness of the
situation, the confinrnent in hope without hope it adds to it
folk humor and an earthiness.
