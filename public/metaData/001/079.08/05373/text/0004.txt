Theatre Club :
Not contented with the production of a steady stream of plays, ballets
and dance dramas, the I.N.T. has also set up facilities to help younger institutions.

Impresario Department :
Despite its emphasis on the interpretation and use of the country's
rich source of traditional and folk material, the |.N.T. has been the first to
realise the importance of a continuous cultural infusion. It has, therefore, actively
sponsored through its Impresario Department artistes and organisation from
abroad during their Indian tour.

Pro posed Cultural Centre
As a logical step towards fulfilling this task, the |.N.T. proposes to
establish a Cultural Centre which would provide a spring—board for dramatic

It is a dream, a dream Vorworth cherishing, and the I.N.T. is confident
that it will fulfill soon.

Performances of Rangmandal's plays in Bombay are sponsored by the
indian National Theatre.
