Sophocle’s and Jean Anouilh's
ANTIGON E
directed by
Rudra Prasad Sengupta
A Greek tragedy. The scene is Thebes after death of Antigone's
brothers Eteocles and Polynices by each other's hands in a
single combat during civil war in Thebes. Creon, the King of
Thebes announces a decree that Eteocles should be buried as
hero but the Polynices, an enemy of the state, should remain
unburied. But Antigone defies Creon's decree and tries the
burial. She is captured and proudly admits her deed and accepts
death representing the holy individuality of human beings. In
our times the protest of Antigone reminds us how potential
and important an individual human being can be.
In this production of Antigone the version of Jean
Anouilh suited to the director’s prupose more or less. But he
needed to graft into the Anouilh's structure one episode the
Creon-Haemon episode from Sophocles. Yet he feels that this
combination not totally valid for him today as a Greek in ancient
times or a French, during the resistance movement, would find
it. Hence some further twists and turns have been given to the
text so that it becomes relevant to us in our own time.
