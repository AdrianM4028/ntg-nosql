Anton Chekhov’s

P ra sa n n a
This great Russian play of naturalistic tradition is presented
in Urdu and adapted in Indian environment. Three sisters,
daughter of a general now dead, sit surrounded by officers in
a provincial garrison town and repeat to each other that they
will soon return to Delhi which seems sunny and warm compared
with their bleak borne. Like all the ambitions of the sisters, this
hope is never fulfilled and life stands stagnant,
To convey this sterility and emptiness of these people's
lives, Chekhov gives the play a curiously static quality, With
every new act one finds those resonably well-educated members
of middle class still sitting and talking, talking about their personal
hopes that are never to be fulfiled, and even not really listening
to each other.
Production design of the play is realistic.
