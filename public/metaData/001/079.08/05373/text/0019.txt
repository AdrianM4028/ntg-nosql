HAYAVA DA NA

directed by
B . V . Ka ra nth
Devadutta and Kapil are friends, Devadutta represents
the intellect and Kapil physical virility Padmini marries Devdatta
and finds herself attracted towards Kapil also, but fails to
establish a fulfilling relationship with either, because each can
satisfy her on only one level, either physical or intellectual.
The play reveals human desire for perfection and its
limitation. However, Hayavadana, the man with the Horseâ€™s

head, sheds his human qualities and in becoming a complete
horse, finds fulfilment.

The play communicates its theme and content through a
distinct style of its own. The playwright's depiction on the

meaning of the play goes beyond the use of words and assumes
a musical visual character, The spare use of properties, Kali, the
dolls, elements of folk theatre prevalent in the prologue, the
use of music and songs add to the theatricality of the play
