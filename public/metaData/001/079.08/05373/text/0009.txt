A first play of Kalidas and for the very first time produc
ed

in Bundelkhandi, a dialect of Hindi, is a comedy depicting th
e
love of a king amorous and carefree. In the play the love affair
of King Agnimitra and Malvika is the central idea and toward
s
the fulfilment of it all the situations and incidents are planned.
The most interesting aspect of the production of
Malavikagnimitra is the Sanskrit language and its time
transcreated in the Bundeli dialect and its rugged exterior
revealing for us, our time. Its inherent vertuousness, becomes
earthy in this Bundeli version. The organic links between the
classical traditions and folk styles of Bundelkhand are highlighted
and add to the theatrical design.
