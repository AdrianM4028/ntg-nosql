This Danish play is first time presented in Urdu takes
its inspiration from problems of the postwar—period. Its main
concern is the crisis of Humanism and reflects an anguished
search for a new basis for human solidarity,
The play shows the crippling effect of the misanthropic
authority of Judge on his three children as they relive a moment
of their childhood and come to understand the impossibility of
escaping their true personalities In this grim vision sister expresses
some hope for the future. The play is an expression of the crisis
in modern life and shows the extraordinary richness and sensitivity
of Branner's dialogue.
The design of production is realistic which some times
magically converts into fantasy.
