ANDHA YUG

Directed by
Bansi Kaul
The famous verse play of Hindi, produced by all leading
directors of Hindi theatre, Andha Yug is based on the epic
war of Mahabharata which resulted in total ruin. Belieflessness
and despair of broken souls in the post-war darkness tends to
reflect the situation and destruction after the second world war.
The whole play IS like a burning city where people are
blindly running to save their lives from expanding fire, In such
a state of anarchy no body is sympathetic to any body and
every body is accusing every body else.
The design of this production is inspired by the Chattisgarhi
Pandvani recrtal but is not an imitation of Pandvani. Movements
of Chau and Manipuri folk dance make the deSIgn more
strong and theatrical
