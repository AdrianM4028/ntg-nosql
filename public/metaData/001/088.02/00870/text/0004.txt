"ARTURO UI" - a synopsis of the play.

The twenties in Chicago, America - a time of intense, economic crisis.

The commercial world is shaken to its foundations by this crisis. A time
when sudden bankruptcy hits huge enterprises and big banks.

The

share market registers a rapid collapse. The play begins with the efforts
of the Commercial Institution "Cauliflower Trust" to recover from this
crisis.

The businessmen of the "Cauliflower Trust" acquire a bankrupt dockyard dirt heap and ask the City Council for a huge loan on the pretext

that they are going to build a jetty. The plan to secure the loan centres
on outwitting Dogsborough, the old City Mayor, and tricking him into
sanctioning the loan. But problems surface in the City Council with
regard to the granting of the loan and an investigation is ordered. Ui, the

leader of an unsuccessful group of gangsters in Chicago decides to make
use of the opportunity. He comes forward to protect the "Cauliflower
Trust" on the one hand and Dogsborough on the other through law and

public opinion. Chicagoâ€™s businessmen and politicians who decide to
avail themselves of thuggery in a moment of their own weakness

ultimately fall prey to that very gangsterdorn.

In this way Chicago

comes to be dominated by Ui who consolidates his power and goes on
to subjugate a small neighbouring town, namely Cicero.
