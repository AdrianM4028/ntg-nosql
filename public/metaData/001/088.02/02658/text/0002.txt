Ariel Dorfman’s play DEATH AND THE MAIDEN
catapulted him from relative obscurity onto the
international stage and has become “the most performed play

in the world today” (Washington Post). The Traverse is
thrilled to have been chosen by Dorfman to premiere

READER — a compulsive, gripping and intense play about
a censor who discovers that the subversive novel he is
trying to ban is describing his own life.
Out of love for his son the censor allows the book’s

publication, aware that it will lead to his own
downfall. At the heart of READER is a passionate plea for
truth and for knowledge of the past. It’s about the power
of imagination to take over reality and reshape it and about
how the imaginary can erupt in unforeseen ways.
Fundamentally, it’s about censorship — national, international

and, more insidiously, internal censorship.
