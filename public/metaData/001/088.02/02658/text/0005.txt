The Traverse is delighted to be reviving its
production of Sue Glover ’s outstanding and award—winning
play and to be presenting it at the heart of its international
Festival programme.

Richly atmospheric, BONDAGERS is set against the
sprawling landscape of the 1860’s Borders farms. Inspired
by the stories and lives of women who worked the vast
agricultural lands in East Lothian and the Borders,

BONDAGERS follows six women as they flirt and fight
their way through a hard year. But when the hinds and
the farmers begin to demand reform to the bondage system,

the impermanence and insecurity of the bondagers’ lives is
brought into sharp focus.
BONDAGERS was commissioned by the Traverse and
first produced in 1991 at' the Traverse’s former home in
the Grassmarket. It won the 1990 LWT Plays On Stage
Award, a Mayfest Paper Boat Award, and was revived at

the Traverse ’s new home in 1993 winning further accolades
frOm audiences and critics; it toured to Canada in 1994
winning the coveted Winnipeg Press Production of the

Year Award.
