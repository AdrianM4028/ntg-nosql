While the pride we feel in our achievement keeps us going, we cannot shut
our eyes to some bare facts of life. Like other voluntary institutions, the DCT also
suffers from resource constraints. We thankfully acknowledge the generosity often

extended by the Government as well as private donors who have provided much
needed support for the Theatre, its ideals and its objectives. Of equal importance
have been the dedicated efforts of the teachers, the schools and the members of

the DOT, and all those who have taken an active part in our activities.
The DCT is an organisation which survives on the co-operation of the parents
and of all those who are concerned with children. We extend our invitation to all
parents to have their children at our training centres and work with us in our
endeavour to discover and promote latent talents of the child. We believe that
every child is endowed with something which is well worth encouraging. After
training, every child receives a certificate of achievement awarded by the DCT.
We believe we are carrying out a task of immense social significance and
value. We are deeply grateful to all who have stood by us in many different ways,

and hope that many more will join us in our endeavour.
