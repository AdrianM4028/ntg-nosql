grade on stage. But our country’s social condition, that
is, social life, where women have a different society
and different social status ( it does not mean the constiutional rights and status of women, but the standard
where the people truly are and how they truly behave )
will surely misinterpret the irony and the comedy carried
out by these two characters if both of them are performed by actors. Only when Estragon is enacted by an
actress as a male character, the play will be enjoyed in
‘
its correct taste.

Lucky’s Speech of Thinking
In fact, Lucky’s speech of thinking is a problem.

The

translators may suffer the same.
The passage seems noisy and meaningless where the
whole theme of the play expressed through it. It is,
of course, an intellectual speech. If proper punctuation
marks are inserted in the passage, we can achieve a
group of sensible paragraphs of intermixed lines or ideas.
Right from the beginning of the passage it is known that
Lucky attempts to express some idea, which overlaps. ,

After filtering the overlaping lines a final residue is achieved as some small sensible paras each having an idea,
but incomplete in themselves. The idea of incornpletness
always continues. What Lucky tries to say is about the
creation of God, man and his struggle for existence, the
suffering, the human labour, sports and mysteries of
nature etc. Towards the end Lucky is so confused that
the whole ideas reduce to single lines and even to single

words that intermixed each other. In this way, by punctuating and breaking into small sensible paras the
passage is translated. Finally, the translated lines are
intermixed again according to the Text and ready for
perforrnence.
