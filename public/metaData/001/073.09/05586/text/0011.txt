The end of the day will be the night, the night where
all human beings are cold, desperate and isolated. The
night where all human beings are compelled to be left
alone, for the individual sleeps alone. There is no
meaning of company at that moment.

The next day they will meet again and will continue
their game of living afresh. And they will wait for the next
night again in the hope of meeting Godot, without any
certainty. Death could not be the real cure from this
sufferring. Therefore, ‘there is no cure for that’ is a
convincing tragic statement of Samuel Beckett.

“Estragon for female character in the form

of man’ ’
The question is how we are going to count the differences, in today’s world, between man add: woman except
their sex. We need to take off the clothes of the charac-

ters and examine them.

There are a number of complex

ideas involving sex and love in the relationship of these
characters. Embracing for every parting sequence is
seen, and remarkable love situations which can only
exist in between two romantic characters are revealed.
Baseless quarrels (gamelike ), heart moving arguments
and comments, affectionate botherations, submissions,
compromises and the sense of sharing happiness andworries that we come across in examining the relationship of these two characters enhance this argument. At
any concluding ३ points of their arguments Estragon is

always found submissive and Vladimir dominating him.
In the opening of Act II, Estragon enters and expresses
his opinion, nothing but love:
Estragon : Don't touch me ! Don’t question me !
Donft speak to me l Stay with me !
