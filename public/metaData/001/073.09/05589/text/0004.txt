ARYAN THEATRE : Established in 1935 and one of the oldest premier Theatres
in Manipur. As a forum for indigenous peoples culture, it had consistently
worked for the growth and development of a conscious and modern Manipuri
theatre.

ARAMBAM SAMARENDRA : Born 1935. Leading playwright of Manipur. 31 plays
so far to his credit. He adopts the natural, realistic style and presents most of
his characters in the box set. He introduced the drawing room problem play in
Manipur. Along with his thought process, observation and comments on human
problems in contemporary Manipuri society, he sharply underlines a search for
the native identity which is amply reﬂected in Judge Sahebki lmung.

WANGKHEM LALITKUMAR : Born 1950. A senior director of Aryan theatre. An
active theatre worker since 1966 with involvement in Manipuri films as well. He
has acted in more than fifty plays and directed fifteen plays so far. Judge Sahebki
Imung, a 1993 revival, is his latest work.
