On the
Kalakshetra Manipur, do appeal to all lovers of theatre to share the joy and hap-

piness to the glorious chapter of KKM in its effort to promote the theatre movement. KKM has completed 25th years of its existence on 19th July 1994 in the
service of the nation with devotion and sacrifice. We are glad that our initiative
and enterprise towards the revolutionary object of theatre movement keeps up
with the strong support of the well wishers. We wish all our patrons and sympathisers will continue their helping hand in shaping Kalakshetra of to-morrow.
Now, with the festival of plays from 20 to 23 March‘94 at Aryan Theatre, the
year long celebration of the silver jubilee opens. There are altogether four
plays including two plays from two sister groups taking the place of honour in
the festival.
Two plays from KKM, the one, TAMNALAI, the first experiment with tradi-

tion produced in 1972, being preserved in its original form and the other,
KANCLA HOJANC, the latest production adapted from the famous Iapaness ﬁlm,
Rashornan, are presenting.

Aryan Theatre, one of pioneers of proscenium theatre in Manipur, is presenting the play, JUDGE SAHEBKI IMUNC, bearing a true representative of the trend
of 60’s. No less a theatre group of 2nd generation than Theatre Mirror is presen—
ting a play, NONCSIDA NCANKHISANU.
The follow on programmes of the year long celebration has been drawn up
with a view to enhancing the richness of theatre as art and science.
