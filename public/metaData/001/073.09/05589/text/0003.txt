KALAKSHETRA

TAMNALAI
20 March ’94

A Manipuri folk tale has been reversed in the present social condition. A
very simple story it is that the poor boy, Chandrakangnal, is the only hope of his
widow-mother. The best college boy who is hopeful of his bright future turns
to be a murderer as he can’t resist the cruel tortures of the socially evil
e1e ments .

The simplicity of the written text transformed into an unusual powerful theatricality that can project the condition of humanity through its inner text. The
local critics and even Badal Sircar of Calcutta still claim that Tamnalai is the masterpeice of Kanhailal. This was first produced in 1972 as the first experiment
with tradition. Shown in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Allahabad. It still preserves the original production.
