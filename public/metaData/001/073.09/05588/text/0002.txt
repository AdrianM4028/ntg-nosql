KALAKSHETRA MANIPUR
Kalakshetra Manipur was established on 19th July, 1969 with Shri Heisnarn Kanhailal as the founder
director. The main objective of the group was to study, revive and project the culture of Manipur
through the art of theatre and to set highest standards of performance to match not only the best in the
country but the world theatre scene.
The ﬁrst decade was a period of exciting experiments. TAMNALAI (HAUNTING SPIRIT), KABUI
KEIOIBA (HALF MAN HALF TIGER), IMPHAL 1973 and KHOMDON MEIROUBI (THE LAST GIRL)

were the earlier productions. The group presented its plays in Calcutta (1974) and the National School
of Drama, New Delhi (1975). PEBET (1975) was the result of a research based project and it became
a mile stone in the history of Indian theatre. This remarkable production was followed by THAMBALNU
(1976), HURANBAGI ISHEI(Song of the Thief) (1977), 'LAIGI MACHASINGA (With the Children of
God) (1978).

In December 1978 the group put up a great theatrical extravaganza - the production of NUPI LAN
(WOMENS’ WAR OF MANIPUR, 1939) in which non—theatre persons from the LUKMAI PANBI
(MARKET WOMEN) of KHWAIRAMBAND BAZAR and members of the audience joined the artistes of
KALAKSHETRA in the performance. This performance in which over 1000 persons participated could
not be documented for records due to lack of resources. The group is planning to repeat this feat in
future.
The Group moved to Urnatohel, a sleepy village in the remote corner of Manipur valley to prepare a
production of SANJENAHA (COWHERD) in which the whole village participated. In the same year
(1979) the group moved to predominantly tribal area of Churachandpur to do a production of
TANGHOU LEH LIANDOU involving the tribal youth of that region.
In the second decade the group’s effort to go professional failed becuase it could not compromise the
quality of its work and its commitment to do socially relevent theatre.

It started research projects to thoroughly study and practice the martial art, folk operatic theatre and
other folk and traditional performing arts of Manipur to evolve a method of actors’ training.

PEI‘ANOA (1982). MRITYU SHWOR (1985), MEMOIRS OF AFRICA (1986) was followed by RASHOMON
in Manipuri iii 1987 and was performed in calcutta.
Kalakshetra has been touring all over the country with its productions sincee 1974. It has participated
in importaont national and international festivals and demonstrations cum workshops. The group
touredJapan (1987) with PEBET and Cairo ( 1991) with MEMOIRS OF AFRICA and MIGI SARANG. Smt
Sabitri Heisnam was adjudged best actress for her performance in MIGI SARANG by the panel of critics
at the Third Cairo International Festival of Experimental Theatre, 1991 and the play was adjudged one
of the best six productions.

The group has taken up an experimental project to create inter-cultural performances by
pooling the talents and expertise of artistes from different regions. This project will help the
group to consolidate its methodology of actors training and also take the group out of its
