WHEN A MAN LOVES
A GIRL HALF HI AGE ,

WE CAN APNPCREERCNIATE
HIS CO RIAGE.
ABOUT MAR

Every man has a soft spot for the fairer sex. And
when the girl in question happens to be his own
daughter, that soft spot becomes particularly tender.

For a father, the upbringing of his precious
daughter is always a labour of love. Her grooming,
her education generate a special manner of attention
and care. For him, she will always be his little
princess. For her, he is a haven. Her shelter from
the big, bad world.

So as the time for her marriage draws closer,

the fears and concerns of a parent surface with alarming
suddenness .
“Will we find the right boy for her?”
This is exactly where The Pioneer Matrmonials
step in.
The Pioneer treats rnatrimonials qualitatively,
unlike others who make it a proverbial free-for-all.

Precisely why our circulation concentrates on a
specific kind of person.
Someone like you.

The kind of man who would go out of his way
to amass a plethora of information on world events.
Upwardly mobile, distinctive, intelligent, articulate.
Affuent, yet sensitive.
The kind of man your girl would be happy with.
So remember. Don’t sell yourself short.
Pick up The Pioneer.
