The play 18 a celebration of ’rnsrgnriicant' , and "illogical
tlmrgs in life nhrch t
shape the way we really are. It's a reaction against using particular human situations ।
as metaphors for general human condition. "General human condition" however
broadly defined is reductionistic. Such plays use situations as metaphors and as a play
it claims to be a metorryrny of society - “slice of life" -- Jacobson. In the play nothing
is metaphorical. The Whole play is a metaphor which does not represent but
comments on history. llistory nr' as an account of what happened but as a memory
with all its disbrtions variations and wishful thinldng's. hrlact it is this history and not
the accurate text book history which operates in shaping a society’s future. Our
intellectual tradition has been trying to write objective history and counter the
talsilication of it. The fact that this attempt cannot bring aout any change in
society is proved by the demolition of the Babri Mosque. As a few sub-altern
historions have realised history operates in society as memories and counter memories.
The play attempts to reclaim some of the memories which are lost. By its sheer
irrationality and vigor -- the play attempts to stir the memories of a community which
urban living has consciously forgotten in its love for rationality
