। GGM In one interview 1 was asked what a noyel is. I replied that any novel is a1
।. process
of unravelling the world. And when I was asked what I meant by that I could ।
not answer the question. Strange and unusual things occurred with One Hundred
Years of Solitude. When a publisher from Buenos Aires said that he wanted to bring
out fryc thousand copies I got very alarmed. I wrote a letter which is still there, and in
which I advised him to be cautious. I wrote that my other published books had a
circulation of 700 to 1500. He, ncyerthcless, brought out 8000 copies in May,
1967. He calculated that by December Ire would be able to sell them all. But before
this he decided to giye the book to a journal. I think the name was The First Plan.
BelOre its release in the market sonre copies of the book were given to critics,
readers, reviewers, with the idea that these people, known for their publications in the
journal. would introduce the novel. But when the issue was practically ready the sixday war in the Middle East broke out. 'I he editors had to immediately change the
cover and shift the contents of my book from the bookshops. By the time the next
issue of the journal came out. i.e.. the following week. all the copies of the book had
ah'eady been sold out. Not a single one remained of the eight thousand. Then it so
happened that for the next three or four months the publisher neither had the paper
nor the chance to reprint thc noycl, and it was impossible to procure eycn a single
copy of ( )ne Hundred Years of Solitude from anywhere. So it was then really that a
direct contact between the writer and the reader was established. But how this
contact came about remains a total mystery to me. Because the publisher himself said
that the book was mainly selling on the streets of Buenos Aires, at the entrances
of the underground metros. etc., rather than in book-shops.

Since then ten thousand copies of the book have been reprinted every month. And
now it is impossible to count how many copies have come out in Spanish - two or
three million. And then a pirate edition ofit has also been brought out. This, to tell
you the truth. only rrrakes me happy because in this case the i only loser is the

publisher. I, on the other hand, lose very little, because in any case the publisher
keeps accounts with me according to his whim and fancy. And then. the pirate
I publisher reaches those whom others cannot reach. In this manner he ﬁlls the Void 1
l and the chinks that have been left out by the legal publisher.

३। Q.

Does that mean that you haye nothing against pirate publishers?

।

i

GGM I am told by my literary agent and publishers that a pirate publisher is harmful
for me. But whatever one might say a pirate publisher will not publish a book that has
। no saleability. He takes no chances and neither can he allow any failure. Then he
। sells it a lot cheaper. In that way it is bought by those readers who would not be able to
l
।
। procure it otherwise. I know of one case where ten Columbian students pooled in to ।
।दृ buy one copy of One Hundred Years of Solitude. I saw this copy. It was worn out.
।1 falling to pieces and coyered all o\ er with notes written by these ten. I presented
५ each of them with a copy and took theirs in exchange. I still keep it.

।३ Coming back to the book. One Hundred Years of Solitude. I am most of all interested

in the life of this book. In the history of literature there are an enormous number of
works that make their appearance with a bang. but then they go into oblivion and
nobody remembers them. And I ask myself: where are all those amazing novels of
chivahy which were selling like hot cakes and being read over and over again. These
were the One Hundred Yearrs of Solitude of those times. No one knows of them...
Well. I haye been anxious about the effect time will haye on my book. As far as One
Hundred Years of Solitude goes. the importance for me is not its success. nor the
enormous number of copies sold or that are continuing to sell. nor the number of
languages into which it has been translated. It has been translated into regrorral
languages of the Soyiet Union. For rue it is important thaLthe now! gets passed on
