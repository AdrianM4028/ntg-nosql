think that l‘rsula resembles their aunt rather than Sophia loren. for instance. let her

Q. Do you feel that the ﬁhning of the novel can bring about
unage?

the destruction of an ३
r

!
GGM Yes. that's just it. It means the destruction of an image because the moment
you are told in a ﬁlm: "Look, this is what he looks like". you are invariably
disappointed. By the way. when I told them that I would sell One Hundred Years of
Solitude for three million which would help to bring about a revolution in I .atin
America. Ernesto Cardenal rang me up and said: "Sell the book. We are going to
bring about this revolution". But they managed it even without my book. So it is still

। waiting for its hour. for another reyolution.....

Q. We had a lot of discussions in our circles about the ﬁnale of One Hundred Years '।
of Solitude. What did you want to express through the universal flood?

r
I

I

GGM When I reached the ﬁnale of ( )ne Hundred Years of Solitude I did not know ।
।
'how to end it. I just went on dragging it. The moment I realized that I had reached
the ﬁnale I felt I must write something to lift the book. because were I to complete it r
in the usual manner the book would collapse. Something was required to lift it. I
r
At ﬁrst I thought as follows: when the last Buendia discovers that a son with a pig’s tail ।
has been born to him and this child dies soon after. he locks himself in the house and l
remains there to die. The ﬁnale turned out to be weak. not saying anything.
Although it ended with a full stop every thing remained in the air. This was a bad .
l

ﬁnale for abook which severely criticized a particular historical reality.

।

the characters and the world which was described in it. In other words. this was not a

।

ﬁnale.

Now, until the last moment. I did not know what Melquiades wrote or what was there I
in his parchnrenls. l lclt it hanging and when my Melquiades wrote I used to think: l

"When will I decipher what he is writing?" and would reply to myself. "whatever I (
might say about his writing it'll be weaker. worse than the secret itself. \Vhatever
explanation I might give will be worse than their realization that it will never be
known what exactly was written there. " But when I reached the ﬁnale and reread the
entire book I once again asked myself this question: "Well, what could h-lelquiades

।

have written?" And I remember. I woke up once in the middle of the night: ".\h!, I t

know what l\'lelquiades is writing! h-lelquiades is writing the book which I. at present. i
am writing. And he, of course. knows that .\Iacorrdo will be erased from the face of1
this earth by the wind. " This was there in the book. An Evil Hour. written in l 955. ten I
' years earlier. But if I ﬁnished it in that way I would have to decipher the language in '
which the notes were written. Once I decided to decipher the text it became clear that
the notes had to be written in Sanskrit. because \lelquiades was a gypsy. Such is the
writer's kitchen. which the r cadcr' does rrol get a chance to see. liul because today we
have br'o.'u‘ln‘<l this subject l can say that these are the real confessions of a .
writer ..... And so. I did not know how to ﬁnish the book. But now I quite like the

ﬁnale and cannot imagine ending it in any other way. The book is now compact.
there is no way out, there is a lock on the book.

I guess it is time to say good-by c. It was a very enjoyable meeting. Some of what I
said here I've mentioned earlier. but most of it was expressed tor the first time. For me
it was a real relaxation to chat and recall things which one does not get a chance to
. do. ("me is forever busy. ln (act it was like an old man reminiscing. lmagine
l_diseovering suddenly that y ou're talking like a grandfather.
