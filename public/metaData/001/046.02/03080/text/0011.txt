Some six years ago, while gin'ng me an inteniew, Mahashweta Desi said, "people are
। very intelligent and strong. they know how to survive even in this cruel, uniust and
( hostile system. We must learn from them." This statement saved me from becoming
I either a snobbish intellectual or ८1211८1'८1'०१'1८11 director.

i The play is the celebration of the capacity and tenanacity of the people in a living
है community. Here. in N81), we are not very much alienated from this source of
j strength. Lonely in our attempts to protect our self-respect in a city, we try to impose

1 "culture" upon ourselves and think that what we have been back home is backward
and unsophisticated.
Our attempt is to show that part [of our beings which is not allowed space in
"modern". respectable society or theatre. We wanted to see what will happen if we
speak on stage. the way our fathers or grand fathers have spoken, or the way we too
speak but only in peer groups.
Nowhere do we want to justify or moralise. If there is any message in the play, it is
just an appeal to accept the past the way it is lived and remembered so that the future
would not be like a narrow road but as an expanse, with altematives.
