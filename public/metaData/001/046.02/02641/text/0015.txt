William Shakespeare

In the thousands of years before him, or the 400 years since, no writer has so
profoundly captured the heart and admiration of the human race as has William
ShakespeareHis plays have for ever enlarged our comprehension of those
inner forces that drive and haunt,agonize and madden people.
He was born in Stratford-On-Avon, north east of London, in 1 564.At the
age of eighteen he married Anne Hathaway, 26. By 1592 the young man from
Stratford had made a name for himself as an actor and a poet.
‘VENUS&ADONIS’, a senuous love poem was his first printed work; it was a
huge success, dedicated to the Third Earl of Southharnpton. Shakespeare
quickely wrote and published’THE RAPE OF LUCRECE’ to equal acclaim. In
1594 Shakespeare joined a troupe of actors, the celebrated Lord Chamberlain’s Men- later called the Kings men.He was popular with his
colleagues,according to their writings;in addition to writing his own plays,he
probably rewrote others’to enrich the troupe’s repertoire.
Through many of the brilliant lines of his work runs one ‘theme’
Shakespeare’s profound melancholy,his constant awareness of the
inevitability of death,which conquers love and beauty and all desires in the
end and the end is never far away.On April 23,1 61 6 after a merry evening spent
with Ben Jonson and another friend,Wil|iam Shakespeare died. He was 52.
He left the world 154 incomparable sonnets,and 38 plays.
Jonson wrote’He was not of an age, but for all time’.
