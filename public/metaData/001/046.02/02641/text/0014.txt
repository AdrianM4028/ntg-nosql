About the play

Scholars agree that the play was composed around 1596, and they also
assume that it was written for performance at an aristocratic wedding
celebration,although it has never been possible to decide which particular
wedding the play was designed to celebrate(South hampton’s in 1598,
Essex’s in 1590, or Derby’s in 1595). Whatever may have been the intention

of the play, it is clear that ‘A M IDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM’ was aimed at
the regular, paying, public playhouse audience and had to appeal to them
in order to survive commercially, and survive it did. The first quarto’s title
page(1600,set from Shakespeare's foul papers) tells us that byothat time it
had been ‘sundry times publicly acted’. After Shakespeare's death the
play went through a varity of metamorphosis. Between 1661 and 1816 there
were nine published ‘improvements’ on the text,some omitting the lover
entirely,some omitting Bottom and his fellows,and one interpolating the

performance of”PYRAM US& TH l SBE’ i nto”As You Like lt’ , immediately after
the masque of Hymen.
In recent years the Royal Shakespeare Company has introduced its
own distortions. Charles Laughton in1959 reduced the ass’s head to a pair

of furry ears and hooves. He was followed by David Waller in Peter Brooks
production in 1 970, this time Bottoms face had the appearance of a circus
clown. The play has gone through various interpretations,due to commercial
viability and artistic discretion, but it remains to be seen whether the director
should respect the text or the stage can afford the flexibility which the play
naturally offers.
