In 1969 the charge of directing a play was entrusted to some and else other
than Amar Horc. That year Ajoy Chatterjee and myself directed a drama each.
The short play ‘Shapath Nilam’ was creditably directed by Ajoy. In 1970 once
again Amar took up the reins and directed two plays—~‘Kumeer’ and 'Bhanru Dutta'
written by Dr. Sisir Das of Delhi University.
However, the activities of the club came to a standstill after 1970. By then
many new drama groups were formed and some of our members joined them to
ﬁnd out new avenues oftheir talents. So, for the time being we had to stop our
activities.

But 1975 brought in new hopes and aspirations. The club has been
reactivised by the remaining members. A very enthusiast group of young men and
women have also joined the force. Already three plays have been staged in one year
one full length and two short plays. This year it is intended to stage at least two full
length and two short plays.
When I look back to the past, I ﬁnd that inspite

of toils and turbulations,

there is enough reason to be satisﬁed. During the last twenty years, Shoni Chakra
has made a remarkable progress. To keep alive an amateur drama organisation for

a period of twenty years is a credit in itself. But mere living is not enough. Shoni
Chakra has put a permanent stamp on the dramatic ﬁeld of Delhi. It was the club
which for the first time brought in Delhi the concept of group theatre. Of course,
many other organisations like Jajabar Gosthi, Kaal Chakra etc. came forward
thereafter to propagate the same idea, still Shoni Chakra will always be remembered
as the pioneer in this ﬁeld. This in itself is a reward for all those who participated
in this pioneering movement.
