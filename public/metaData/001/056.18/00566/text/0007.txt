About Shoni Chakra

‘J’

Since its inception in 1956 Shoni
Chakra stands for purposeful drama.
The theatregoers of the metropolis.
are well aware that during early
sixties a sense of “Group Theatre”
emerged in the Bengali drama
movement. In this the contribution
of Shoni Chakra is not insigniﬁcant.
During this period we Staged ‘Jhumur’
‘GhumNei’ ‘Labanakta’ ‘Nilkantha‘
‘Dwiper Raja’ ‘Samudro-o—Manush’
and several other dramas which set
this trend in motion.

Shoni Chakra felt the necessity of
encouraging local playwrights also
and

Sisir Das,

Phani Bose, Arnar

Hore. Dipak Ghosh and Brojen
Bhaumik
were
introduced
as
dramatists for the ﬁrst time in Delhi.
While staging modern plays, Shoni
Chakra has not neglected Classices—
either by Tagore or by Pirandello.

The last two

decades

saw

Chakra tirelessly working

Shoni

for

the

enhancement of standard of Bengali
drama. To this the institution might
not have always succeeded but the
endeavour continues.

In

this

Shoni

co-ope‘ration and hopes to get the
same in future as well.
