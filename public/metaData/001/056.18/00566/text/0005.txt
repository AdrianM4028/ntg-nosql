The founder of Russian realism is
usually said to be Nikolai Gogol (1809-52),
the first ever writer of commanding genius,
who concentrated his attention on small
common place themes and men and women
of an undistinguished vulgar sort. He was
not a realist in the strict sense of the word.
In his characterisations he was an artist of
sentiment, satire and caricature. Gogol's
creations were never well-rounded potraits

and his creations were of a negative sort
swindlers, Spendthrifts and lazy people.

“The

Inspector General"

(1836)

is

basically a satiric comment, an attack on

graft and dishonesty.

The scene is laid

among the officials of a small town and is
based on a personal experience of Pushkin
which he narrated to Gogol. On the basis
of that story Gogol produced a hurnerous
masterpiece.

Even after so many years, one finds the

theme of the play has all relevance with the
present.
