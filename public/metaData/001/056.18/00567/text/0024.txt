It gives me immense pleasure to know that Sada Arts Society is bringing
out a souvenir on the occasion of concluding session of Theatre
Workshop and staging a play on l 0111 June, 2008 at L . T. G New Delhi .
The efforts ofthe group have been commended by one and all. I do hope
that workshop would be able to inspire young artistes.

My best wishes for success ofentire endeavour.
