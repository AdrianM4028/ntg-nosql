President '3 Note

Theatre workshop is the best medium to promote self confidence in each
individual. The sooner we are exposed to this, the better it is. Such theatre
workshops are blessings in disguise . I, personally feel happy to witness
young minds working under able facilities so efÔ¨Åciently.
I wish all the young ones a very bright future.
With best wishes
