Our teachers took care ofus as we are there children. I enjoyed a lot and worked
a lot, actually I learnt a lot. The learning was like a leadership, how to lead small
children and others. Over all it was a great experience and did things I always
wanted to do and I have never done it before and I also loved the dance which I
learnt from KaiÔ¨Å sir.
