The workshop generated a lot of enthusiasm in me and was the best first step
one could take as a beginner in the ﬁeld of acting and theatre. Over all it was a
good fun.
Prabal Poddar

During this workshop I have learnt many things which are still in process. We
have been taught many things like voice exercises different body movements,
learning how to get into a character and the best part of this workshop I
personally felt and believed that is, in this workshop people really listened and
cared for each other. There was a great team spirit in this workshop.

My last year's experience was very good that is why I have j oined the workshop
again. Actually this wOrkshop teaches us acting but we learnt more than just
acting. The credit goes to our director Danish sir, he is a kind of person from
whom one can learn a lot. He always inspires me to do good work. I enjoyed
each and every moment of this workshop but dance and theatre games I liked
the most.

It has been a great learning experience here. I always wanted to do a
Shakespearean with a different interpretation. Good fun.
