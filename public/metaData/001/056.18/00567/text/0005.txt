In 1964, Shoni Chakra turned a new comer when we staged its
first full-length drama 'Labonakta’ and also got the club registered. Since
then it has never looked back. Many outstanding performances were staged,
both short plays and full-length dramas—'Politics’, 'Dwiper Raja', 'Dinanto'
'Keya Kunja', 'Faryad', 'Sher Afghan’, 'Gateman', 'Jyathamoshai'. (See the list
of our performances).
After a gap of about five years from 1970, when our activities came

to a standstill the club was rejuvenated.

A very enthusiastic group of young

men and women joined the force and staged a number of full-length and
short plays within a very short period.
During the last two decades, Shoni Chakra has made a remarkable
progress. To keep alive an amateur dramatic club for a period of twenty-four

years is a credit in itself. But mere living is not enough.

Delhi. This is the club

which for the first time brought in Delhi the concept of group theatre. This
is a reward for all those who participated in this pioneering movement.
As we look back we feel

proud of our achievement in the last

twenty-four years. Today as we enter into Silver Jubilee Year we humbly
extend our heart felt thanks to all those who helped us to reach the Silver
Jubilee Year.
