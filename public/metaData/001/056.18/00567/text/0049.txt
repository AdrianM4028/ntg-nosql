Moments Shared by senior group
I have been participating from the last years workshop organized by the Sada
Arts Society. I truly appreciate the work of Sada Arts Society nurturing the
talent of acting through this workshop. This year I enjoyed more because I
had an added responsibility oforganizing this Theatre Workshop.

It was a wonderful experience to work with Mr Danish Iqbal. I have attended
so many workshops but this was different from others

The experience was enriching to the extent that one learnt to interact with
others. One also opened up and in the course wasn't shy from doing different
things. It was a conÔ¨Ådence building experience.

The Workshop was an eye opener. I always thought how it would be to act in a
Shakespearean play, guess what I am actually acting in one now. Acting is
tough my friend . . . and if someone tells you its not .... . . tell them to contact
me. The exercises and acting tips really helped me out in realizing few things
about my self. For starters really need sessions of Danish sir. Whenever and
wherever the workshop happens I'll make a point to join it. Thank you for all
your encouragement and support Danish sir.
