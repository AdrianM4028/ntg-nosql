Bhalomanusher Gappo — based on

Brecht's play Good Women

of Schletzoan’ depicts the struggle of Abhimanyu amidst the rat race of
our present society in which everybody is out to gain undue advantage
at the cost of others.

The greed, petyfogging mentality and corruption

against which Abhimanyu has to fight a lone and loosing battle brings
into sharp relief the tragedy of our present times where a 'Bhalomanush’

is crowded out of existence through the machinations of a few while

the society as a whole remains entirely apathetic to his struggle.
