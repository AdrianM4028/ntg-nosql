Of

All you put before us is victims, acting yourselves
Like helpless victims of inner impulses and outside powers.
They receive their pleasures like dogs, tossed to them by unseen
Hands like unexpected crusts, and just as
Unexpected the nooses drop around their necks, the cares which
Fall from above. But we, the spectators
On the lower benches, sit with glassy eyes and goggle
Fixed in your grip, at your grimaces and convulsions

Sensing at second hand the proffered pleasure and
Uncontrollable care.
No. we cry form the lower benches in our discontent

Enough. That will not do. Have you really
Not yet heard the rumour which says
That this network was knotted and imposed by men ?
Today everywhere, from the hundred-storyed cities
Over the seas, cross-ploughed by teeming liners
To the loneliest villagers, the word has spread
That mankind's fate is man alone.
T h e r ef o r e

We now ask you, the actors

Of our time - a time of changes and of boundless mastery
Of all nature, even men’s own - at last
To change yourselves and show us mankind’s world
As it really is : made by men and open to their improvements.
