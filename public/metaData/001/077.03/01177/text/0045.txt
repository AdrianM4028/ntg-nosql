A rejoinder to Daura Laat Sahib Ka
Ma noh ar Verma

(National Mail, Bhopal 6 August, 1993)

This refers to the report published in the National
Mail of the July 27 regarding the performance of the
play Daura Laat Sahib Ka; S atyagarah Moteram Ka,
presented at B harat B haw an by the Theatre group Nat
Bundele. Certainly the theatre goers 0fthe town expected
a better critical treatment of the play in your esteemed
daily rat-her than this superﬂous, negligently worded
report loaded with hastily drawn conclusions.

theatre-goers equally share my anguish.

This causal dealing of the report leads me to
believe that perhaps the reporter has neither cared to
read the stories of Premchand about Moteram nor its
dramatization in question. Consequently he has made
some very damaging and derogatory remarks about the
performance. He rates it as poor, complains of over—
acting and buffoonery points to obscenity in a scene
and hopes for an edited version and better music in
future performances, in the concluding lines.

I believe that the repoter has failed to locate the
very spine 0fthe play ie. the delicate handling of farce
with a view to honestly protray the hell—hole of
corruption, exploitaion, sex, violence and the immoral
alliance between bureaucracy, merchants and prieststhose who betrayed the struggeling masses in the
national movement for Independence for their vested
interests.

Had the performance been really poor, failing in
its objective and losing its impact I would not have
cared to reach out to the innumerable, readers of
National Mail. On the contrary the performance was
good, interesting and really satisfying and I immensely
enjoyed it along with hundreds ofother spectators till

the end.

It is a story 0fthe past but every minute reminds
us of today's tragic existence stuck deep in the sandy
quagmire of moral decadence. It is really unfortunate
that the farcical element in thepl ay making imaginative
use of clowning and buffbonery which is the very
strength of the play is being.interpretced as its main
weakness.

I feel that one should not be so completely
blinded by the stereo typed aptitudes, regirrlerrted
aesthetics, preconceived theories and conventional
preferences that he may find it difficult to evaluate
sympathetically any new ideas, deviated art work oroan
unconventional performance done obliquely.

The reporter has totally missed the point that
this deliberate designing of the clowning antics in fact
aims at building up the ess. . tial cathartic impact which

Obscenity in art and literature is an age old issue
and tones of books on the subject raising mountains of
arguments (kicking a lot ofdirt as well) have failed to
draw the demarketing litre between the two. It is the
dexterous tight rope walking that saves art from
obscenity. The symbolic night scene at the Kotha of
