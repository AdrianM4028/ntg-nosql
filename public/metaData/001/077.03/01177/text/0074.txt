blending tradition and contemporaineity.

Achieving this conﬂuence has been one of Nata
Bundele's superhuman efforts, and the manner in
which it celebrates the culture of Madhya Pradesh
without acquiring merely regional shades is reminiscent
of Mark Twain, who once said that for the writer 'his
experience and its ennvironment is like a small postage
stamp which belongs to one particular country, but that
small postage stamp can travel the world'. Madhya
Pradesh is like Twain's postage stamp to Nata B undel e,
with it, Nata Bundele will travel the world.

The dream has taken shape: it has come of age.
And it is here to stay. Nata Bundele is one theatre
group, as oftoday, whose activities span the whole of

Madhya Pradesh, from the major centres to the deep
interiors. Theatre workers and community workers
who have beneﬁted from the theatre training workshops
organised by the group are actively involved in the
public education and literacy drives that have been
undertaken. The range and its expansion achieved by

Nat Bundele extends from street theatre to National
Theatre Festivals, and the group succeeds in giving
precise and exact, aesthetic and creative expression to
its points of view at both levels of theatre.

Just as it has most of India. Its -plays have been
performed in Madhya Pradesh and in major theatre
centres all over the country, in signiﬁcant National
theatre Festivals. It has participated in 6 National
Theatre Festivals organised by the National S‘angeet
Natak Akaderni, New Delhi. Nata Bundele has
represented Hindi theatre in the B a1 Gandharva J anma
Shatabdi Samaroh, organised by the South Central
Zone Cultural Centre in 1987. It has also left its lasting
impression on the staging of poems by well known
poets, and is continually engaged in the quest for new
dimension of expression to fulﬁl its creative urges.

Relating theatre to society through the generation
oftrained theatre and community and literacy workers,

Nata Bundele has explored hon‘ zons and in transcending
them, has added to the meaning and relevance 0ftheatre
in times which can be said to be difﬁcult for the art
form.

The dream has taken shape, but it is not over. In
fact, it mightjust be beginning. lftheatre has to live and
sustain, it cannot do so without dreams. For dreams
mean hope, dreams mean a quest for the ideal, and as
long as these things remain, the world will remain, and,
more important, humanity will.

Among the landmarkproductions ofNata Bundele
figure plays like Chanda Bedni (which took the theatre
world by storm and featured Ran] ana and lrfan Saurabh
in the leads) in Bundeli , as also Bharam Ka Bhoot,

Murga Desi Baang Videsi; Kishanlal, JagarMagar
AndherNagar—a tr'endsetting , novel collage ofsome of
Bhartendu Harish Chandra's Plays; Daura laat Saahab
Ka Satyag rah Mote Ram Ka. A ndhere Mein was the
stage presentation ofa long poem by Gaj anan M adhav
Muktibodh. Several jewels string the necklace of
children's theatre done by Nata B undele including
Laakh KiNaak, AndherNagari ChaupatRaja, Salom'

For Nata Bundele, the dream is beginning. A
new one. And going by its record, it will pursue it to
fulﬁlment.
