Political satires are fraught with the risk ot‘
degenerathin into non-sensical farce i I‘ not handled
properly withshaip understanding ol‘political realities.
The danger is all the more likely if bul‘t‘oonery is
de l i be rat e 1 y used in acting to expose the hypocrisy of
the religio—political and bureaucratic system. Against
this background presentation of Daura l .at Sahab Ka
Satyagrah Moteram Ka was a chal 1 angi ngjob l'or Nata
liundele. Based on the stories of Prem Chand's
famous character Moteram Shastry, the play was
designed 10 expose bu l‘t‘oonery in the system through
bu 11३८ ionery on the st age.

as has been adtiot Ly potrayed by । ’rem (‘hand The play
assumes astonishing relevance in the context of the
Ayodhya tangle. Needless to say that the religio—
political skulduggery being resorted to by the leaders
on Ayodhya is only an extension ol‘the black—comedy
in the misleading Satyagrah ol‘Mote Ram Shastry. The
farcical style of acting accentuates the situation and
provokes the audience to wonder i 1३ religit )n has such a
great mischiefpotential.
It is a story ot‘the past but every mi nute reminds
us of today's tragic exist ance st uck deep i n the sandy
quagmire ol'moral decadence. l l‘we remind the poem

Certainly the play does not lit in the sten‘o-typed
ilk t । ng methodology. ln the play-bul‘l‘oonery is intended
and it does serve the purpose. The unholy nexus
between the politics and religion is not a new
phenomenon. liven in the pie-independence days,
raligion was being misused to break people's movement
