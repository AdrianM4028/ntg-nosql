integrating more with the needs of the play. The
multiple strains of fol k elements are blended to create
a new kind of symphonic effect.

A brahmin youth falls in love.Chanda, a girl
belonging to the B edni Community. Chanda treats this
as a j oke and sets conditions impossible for the youth
to fulÔ¨Ål -oouditions which would mean the repudiation
ofthe entire Brahmin tradition. But the youth accepts
all the donditions. Chanda is moved by the youth's
sincerity and dedication, and cannot but reciprocate his
love. A crisis ensues in both the communities. The
brahmins appeal to the king to reSolve the issue. The
king, who himself is in love with Chanda becomes

problems. the same problem is faced by the ropedancer Chanda Bedni, hence the play is a unique
interaction betWeen a modern poem and a folk legend.

The fol-k elements that are in the play are not
