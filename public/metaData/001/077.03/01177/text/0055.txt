Bhartendu ‘s plays, poetry and B haj ans and weave these
all in to a full length play in such a way that cumulative
effect ofhis creative strength come to the force. In the
.l agar M agar Andher N ag ar, the group has used pieces
of Sabai .lati Gopal Kee, Basant Puja (small farce)
B andar Sabha (parody of lnder Sabha), a song of l’rein
Yogi ni play and some poems and a Bhajan ofgreat poet
KAB IR I )AS . However, the story revolves round the
main theme of Andher Nagari.

Bhartendu Harishchandra has heralded a new
age oinndi literature. He has not only moulded Hindi
plays in a new shape but has also lent a new vision to
contemporary Hindi literature and, by extension to the
Indian literature. In B hartendu‘ 5 creation we can easily
discern tradition and its continuity. His plays are
synthesis of tradition, Indian theatre and i rnitable
concepts ofthe West. His plays provide us reassuring
continuity of tradition with contemporariness always
ﬁnding its proper place.

The play is designed in a very different way.
Audience sit in the centre and performers enact the play
in surrounding. This aim is to keep the thought process
of the audience astir. The audience is made to think
partly due to innovative style of presentation but the
main motivating factor is lihartendu himself, in a
similar way as alienation owes its effectiveness to
Bertolt Brecht, a pl aywright and not Brecht, a presenter.

His plays have tremendous strength to underline
the inherent ironies ofconternporary reality. His creative
