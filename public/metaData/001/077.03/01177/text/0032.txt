ALAKHANANDAN, playwright and director, recently

presented Chanda B edni at the NCPA'8 Experimental .
Theatre and at the Ravindra Natyamandir; just one
evening each. Those lucky enough to catch the play
were regaled with a roisterous, energetic unfolding of
the legend ofChanda a famous prostitute ofthe B edni

it is not individuals in the form ofheroes and heroines

that carry the play forward but situations and the
narrative.
Through all this, Alakhanandan’s mode is not

realistic in terms ofgestures and emotions, he analyses
the tense under currents of society for example, the
moral issues raised by Chanda and a young Brahrnin
youth falling in love with each other. Chanda is not
aspiring to a rise in caste status; rather, she asserts
herself by upholding her right to love the man of her
choice. This shocks her own community, her brother
and the king himself. And the B rahmi n youth, instead
of keeping Chanda as a mistress, which would have
been quite acceptable to everyone, gives up his own
vocation i [1 order to learn hers and be hertrue companion.
The B edni s, as much as the B rahrnins , are affronted by ३
this reversal of caste roles. Finally, as Chanda falls
from the tightrope and acquires the status ofa legendary
heroine, what emerges is not the simplistic triumph of
the underprivi l aged or the cynical assertion ofauthority
but the confused mess ofcontemporary morality. Who
is the martyr? Who is the saint? The stunned people on
stage as well as the audience are left without any pert
answers.

community, a favourite of the king, to whom he
promises halfhis kingdom i f she will dance on a 100foot long tightrope. Hearing of this, the queen is
jealous. By seducing a local shoemaker she convinces
him to cut the rope while Chanda is dancing on it.
What attracted Alakhanandan to the story was
the triangular relationship between authority/power,
the dancer/artiste and the shoemaker/labourer. Using
this as the base, he has constructed a dramatic structure
involving other characters drawn from contemporary
semi-urban society. There is the sadhu, outside the
formal pale of society, who believes in nothing and

nobody, not even God perhaps. He swirls seductively
and swings his hips more provocatively than the
dancing girls in the play. The brahrnin priest in red—
framed sunglasses reads out geneology in one breath,
then takes a deep drag on a much-needed cigarette,
surrounded by his little troupe of apprentices who are
quick to learn the ropes of exploitation. Chanda's
drunken brother, who lives offChanda‘s earnings , and
the motley group of B ednis, who are morall y confused
about the right course of action, are the other lively
characters.

The story of Chanda Bedni could lend itself
quite easily to a melodramatic format. But Alakhnandan
has worked quite systematically and consciously against
certain standard conventions. Thus the presence of
Chanda, the king, the mochi, and the B rahrnin lover are
all kept to the minimum. There are no props, no
monologues, there is no rnirning. And except in the one
scene where Chanda invokes the Devi, no single person
is allowed to dominate the entire stae. Even in the
crucial scene where Chanda walks the tightrope, she is

Certain scenes were extremely well worked out
in terms of movement and mood . . . for example, the
scene when a whole phalanx of soldiers enters; they
walk across the stage to encircle and trap Chanda in the
forest, then spring apart as the king enters and arrange
themselves at the back of the stage, almost like a line

of trees, facing away from the king and the audience.
denoting a private moment between Chanda and the
king. Again in the court scene, the rather sti ff and

formal atmosphere is lightened with a court dance
' performed by a man dressed as a woman. This dance
is not played as broad comedy but rather with great
