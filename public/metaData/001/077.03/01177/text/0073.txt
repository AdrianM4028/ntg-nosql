NATA BUNDELE: A DREAM TAKING SHAPE
S achi n 'I‘iwari

the Rang Mandal, sharpening and honing his creativity
till he reached a point where the restless artist in him
asserted himsil f to compel him to explore directions
which were immediate and demanding because oftheir
relevance, and, in spite of it, their neglect.

This is the story of Nata Bundele. A story,

which has its beginnings in a vision, which inspired a
handful ofpeople to dream ofwhat seemed so beautiful
for theatre, an exploration and fulﬁlment of its limitless
possibilities: and yet, it also seemed impossible.
Undaunted by the magnitude ofthe Herculean struggle
which lay ahead, undeterred by the stumbling blocks
which must necessarily lie in the way of any quest for
artistic excellence, this heroic handful continuted to
follow their dream, dreaming it, a little like 'I‘ E

It was then that Nata Bundele was born, as a
dream. A dream which could ﬁll the required gaps in
theatre activity, restoring its focus to where it was
required and necessary, not merely for projection, but
communication with audiences. Dreams have difﬁcult
births, and they can easily die, in the absence ofproper
sustenance and 'shots in the arm' to give it strength.
Strength-giving shots in the arm came along in the
form of two other members of the dramatis
p ersona e : Ranj ana and I rfan S aurabh. Who shared the
dream totally and equally, coming across with the grit
and determination as and when required on Nata
B undele'sjourney. They eventually emerged not merely
as people who gave ' shot s in the arm' bu t as people who
proved to be the strongest arms that could hold the Nata
Bundele banner ﬂying high. It is not surprising that
both have emerged as the ﬁnest artists who are among
the ﬁnest, not just in Madhya Pradesh, but in the
country. There were the others, of course , who shared
sometimes part, sometimes more, of the journey, and
everyone had something to give, something constructive
to contribute.

Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), 'not with their eyes

closed in the dark recesses of the mind in the dark of
night, but with their eyes open, in the light of day. '
And that is what made all the difference.
Beginning with the slow realization of that dream,
leading up to the scaling of greater, yet greater heights
in the contemporary theatre of Indi a, carving for itself
a meaningful and focal niche in the performing arts,
Nata Bundele continues to grow from strength to
strength, enriching its quest for a purposeful, relevant

theatre.
So much for the genesis, so much, for the

Even before its formal registration by the
Regi strar of Societies of M adhya Pradesh on October
16, 1989, Nata Bundele had been active and had already
proved itself as a creative theatre group of quality
which was set to transcend each succeeding multi
faceted theatre horizon. So far, the range and scope of
