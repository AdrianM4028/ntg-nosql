are not in a position to have a concensus, a young man
(Deepak 'I‘iwari) manages to tempt hungry moteram to
do justice to the basket of sweets he had brought with
him. Moteram grabs the sweets and the people and
satyagrahis are able to break the strategy built by the
‘
magistrate.
The spicy dialogues and powerful satirical
comments on social and political life made the theme
important. But over-acti ng , buffoonery in the name of
folk-presentation could not hold the comedy. It lost its
impact. The night scene at the dancing girl Chamel ii an
( Kayn at Kausar) slipped easily into obscenity.

BHOPAL : Nat Bundele's new comedy Daura Laat
S ahab Ka S atyagraha Moteram Ka drew a large crowd
on July 25 at Bharat Bhavan All the tickets were sold
out, still the people wanted to manage a seat and see the
play. But the performance was disappointing end many
left the hall during the interval. Had it been properly
edited, the comedy would have made a mark.
The play is a drama adaptation ofPr'emachand's
story by Safdar Hashrni and Habib T‘anvir. In the
presentation directed by Alakhnandan, one felt there
was a disparity between the concept of the veteran
director and the preform ance by the group.
What remained was a place in preindependent
India where the Viceroy is to a Pay a visit and the local
magistrate (Praveen Gautarn) summons his ofﬁcers to
have the p]aceready for His Excellency's visit. Inspectors
ofvarious departments give fantastic ideas which were
difﬁcult to implement. Ultimately it was decided to
have Pt. Moteram Shastri agree to go an indeﬁnite fast,
so that the proposed strike is stopped. Moteram (I rfa n
Saurabh) agrees without assessing the difﬁculties to

The clever use ofchorus in the change-overs and
having some activity in the front portion of the stage
helped the continuity but that too was not effective
towards the end.
० Hope the future presentation of the play will
have an edited version and better music.
