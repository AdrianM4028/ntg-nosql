Alakhnandan : Do you forsee more poetics in the future
the atre?

R G B : It is already there in abundance. There was
some aberration for some time. But now that
the illusion of European realism is giving
way to prose writers like Borkhes, Things ..
are changing for poetry. Poetry is inherent in
the very character of theatre .
Alakhnandan : Do you know I am angry with you for
certain reasons?

R G B : Why not? I know it for sure. Your anger is not
unjustiﬁed but blame it on time. And, does
it affect you any way?
