The stories travel in between
past and present and they have
been presented in the same
order. The atmOSphere of the
stories is like an irnpressionstic
painting. Loneliness and its
agony as borne by human
characters, their fine emotional

nature, create the atmosphere
of the presentations.
The emotions of the
characters long to belong and
errupt to explore the meaning of
life.
They are travelling in

mirages of happiness and pain.
'There is no fear in
unhappiness, but that we call
happiness is always surrounded
by pain'.
'We stay in the mist of pain
and to give it a name is to open
the Pandora's box.
The characters of the story
Ira, Fatty, Nihal Chandra are

searching for the meaning of
life.
That is why they carry
deep inside them a strong will
to live.
