THE PLAYWRIGH'I‘
_
Franz Kafka was born in Prague
in 1883, the son of a rich Jewish

Czech merchant. After studying
literature and medicine for a
short time, he turned to law,

which he believed was the profession that would give him the
greatest amount of free time for

his private life and for his writing. He took his doctorate in law
at Prague University, obtained a
job with an insurance company,
and later became a clerk in the
semi-Governmental Workers’s Insurance Office. In later years the
necessity of earning his living by
routine office work became an intolerable burden, and he broke

away altogether, settling down
in a Berlin suburb to devote himself to writing. In 1914 he became
engaged, but broke it off, feeling
unable to face marriage. He
made one more attempt to
marry, but it was discovered that
he was suffering from tuberculosis and he went to a sanatorium.
His unsatisfactory love affairs,
his relationship with his father, a

self-made man who cared nothing for his son’s literary aspirations, and his own inﬂexible

intellectual honesty and almost

psychopathic sensitivity finally
broke down his health, and the

’hunger years’ of post-1918 Berlin added the finishing touches.
He died in 1924. Although he
was a Czech, Kafka's books were

all written in German. Seven of
them were published during his

lifetime.

The Trial first appeared, after the
author’s death, in 1925.
