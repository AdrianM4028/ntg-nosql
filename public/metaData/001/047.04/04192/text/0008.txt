Directorâ€™s Note

In 1975 I was asked by Mr. Ebrahim
Alkazi to direct a play for the
National School of Drama Repertory

Company. Since then I have been
always a dupe of next year.
Eventually, I have made it in
1981.

On the contrary, Manohar and his

colleagues are very alive and

and suggestions; they are warm,

I was on the wrong track or was
trying to dish out vague
generalities.
Regarding the production itself, I
doubt that I have anything to say.

If it does not speak for itself, my
apologia would not save it.

I shall look forward to working
with them again. It was good
theatre experience for me; it was a

compliment insinuating that the
Repertory people are not upto
