The next day Sundari, while apologizing to Nand for her
behaviour pleads with him to forget the unpleasant episode.
What follows is a delicately crafted love-scene in which she
persuades Nand to spend the day with her. Just as Nand,
while helping with her toilete, anoints her forehead with a
motif, they are interrupted by Alka, Sundari's maid. Alka
informs them that Gautam Buddha himself had visited their
mansion for ’Bhiksha’ but had to return empty handed. On
hearing this Nand seeks her consent to leave her promising
to return and complete the motif after having apologised to
his brother.

Despite his promise Nand fails to return. Sundari is full of
misapprehension. Finally, he returns but with his head
Shaven. Sundari, fearing that he has become a Bhikshu,

breaks down. Nand on his part is disillusioned both with
Budha who has shaved his head against his wishes and by
Sundari’s reaction. He leaves home to find other solutions to
his questions.
