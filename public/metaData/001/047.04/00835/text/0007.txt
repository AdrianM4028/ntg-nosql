We tried to play with this duality in the overall design of
the production — whether it be the music, or the set design
or the way the characters move on stage. This was indeed
a major challenge for all of us as a team. Our attempt is
to explore the meaning of the text at as many levels as
possible. How far we have succeeded in this will be

borne out by the actual performance.
At this point I would like to express my gratitude to Shri
Kedarnath Singh who despite his other preoccupations
agreed to translate some verses of Saundaranand at a very
short notice. Some other friends and colleagues especially
Nibha Joshi, Bansi Kaul and Anuradha Kapur helped me
through their valuable suggestions. And lastly I would like
to thank all the members of the team whose creative
participation made this entire process very exciting.
