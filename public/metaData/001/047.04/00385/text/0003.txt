BEGAM KA TAKIA
‘Begam Ka Takia‘ is the tale of two brothers who share
the same blood, the same bread and the

same roof. A rift

appears between them with the advent of woman and wealthblood turns into water. and bread into dust and ashes. Greed,
desire, lust, Karma and non Karma are locked in a tussle. The
Invisible weaves the web of prearranged destinies, and mortals

struggle on with their dreams and ambitions. The intricate and
absorbing patterns of the vississitudes of life are unravelled and
their reality revealed to us by the seer

Dariyashah through

the eyes of his disciple Oatrashah.

The locale of the story is set in a small village of masons
and bricklayers. This is the story of their lives as told by
them.
