JOHN CLARE

JOHN CLARE (1793-1864). Born at
Helpston, a Northamptonshire

village, the son of a country labourer
and of a mother who could neither
read nor write, Clare was put to
work in the ﬁelds before he was
seven. But he loved the ballads that

‘over his horn of ale’ he heard his
father sing; and a copy of Thomson’s
“Seasons” that had somehow come

his way inspired him with a
passionate love of classic poetry.

His “Poems Descriptive of Rural
Life and Scenery” and “The Village
Minstrel” appeared, and were
fovourably reviewed, in 1820 and
1821. He was introduced to
Coleridge, De Quincey and Lamb,

and won the approval of John
Keats. Two subsequent collections,
his “Shepherd’s Calendar” and
"Rural Muse”, produced between
Portrait of John Clare by W. Hilton.

1827 and 1835, were comparatively
unsuccessful. Always wretchedly

poor, in later life he developed
symptoms of insanity, and was
relegated to Northampton Country

Asylum, where he died in 1864,
after twenty years’ conﬁnement. His
best-known poem ‘Written in

Northampton County Asylum’, has
a particular poignant music:
I am .’ yet what I am who cares,
or knows ?

My friends forsake me like a
memory lost.
I am the self-consumer of my

woes;
They rise and vanish, an oblivious
host,
Shadows of life, whose very soul
is lost,
