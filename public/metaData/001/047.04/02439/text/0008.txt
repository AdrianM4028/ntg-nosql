ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
OF THE PLAY

By 1750 the average English

no doubt, very real. But all this

village had settled down, or rather

does not alter the fact that the

relapsed, not into the ordered
stability which it had enjoyed during
the Middle Ages, but into a
tolerable composure. Rural life was
far from being moribund. Customs,

peasantry (what was left of it)
suffered because of it.
The lord of the manor, the parson,
the free-holder and other improprietors took good care to see that

folk-lore and folk-song were still

they were more than amply

honoured although only in restricted

compensated for any changes that
occurred. The cottager was without
means of redress. From now on he
lived a hand-to-mouth existence,

forms: the community spirit had
survived. At least 75 per cent of the

population still earned a llving
from the land.
No sooner had the affairs of the
lower orders begun to mend,
however, than the Agrarian
Revolution upset them again. Old
wounds were reopened. In the reign
of George III no less than 300 Acts

of Enclosure were passed; and
though the change-over was

accomplished piecemeal ( — the last
fell swoop was delayed until the
Act of 1845) nobody knew whose
farm might be the next to be taken
away. Enclosure was a sword of
Damocles threatening most villagers.
In the interest of progress the

open-ﬁeld system had to go. It was
imperative that waste lands and
commons should be placed under
cultivation in order to supply the
needs of a rapidly growing,
industrial population; and may be
it was in the public interest that the
landed gentry should be given a
greater measure of control. The
alternative of wholesale famine was,

dependent on a day-to-day pittance.
Throughout the eighteenth century
Enclosure had produced a general

upward trend in prices, and the
Revolutionary and Napoleonic
Wars forced them up to famine
level. For a few years after 1830 a
spell of unusual agricultural prosperity set in — too late : and in any
case the farm labourer had no
beneﬁt Of it, for already the man
was being replaced by the machine.
This, then, was the economic
background of the period which was
to see the “Peasant Revival”. If
the spiritual opportunity seemed

good the economic situation was,
to put it mildly, not so good.
Throughout their lifetime, before
their own eyes, all that these men

stood for was being swept away.
Before they died the bottom had
dropped out of their little world.
