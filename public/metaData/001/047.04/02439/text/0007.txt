And yet I am — I live — though
I am toss’d
Into the nothingness of scorn and
noise,

Into the living sea of waking
dream,

Where there is neither sense of
life, nor joys,
But the huge shipwreck of my own

esteem
And all that’s dear. Even those I
loved the best
Are strange — nay, they are
stranger than the rest.
I long for scenes where man has
never trod —
For scenes where woman never
smiled or_ wept —There to abide with my Creator,
God,

And sleep as I in childhood
sweetly slept,

Full of high thoughts, unborn. So
let me lie, —
The grass below; above, the
vaulted Sky.
