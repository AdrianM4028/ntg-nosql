CULTURE

All men must answer in their lives

Those questions whose answers are enormous
Because when one man decides how he lives

He changes all men’s lives
There are no small questions for small men
All men are Hamlet on an empty street
Or a windy quay
All men are Lear in the market

When the tradesmen have gone
No man eats sleeps or loves for himself alone
Harvest and dreams and teaching the young
Don’t take place in a small room
But in the spaces of other men’s lives

How we eat decides justice
Our homes measure the perversion of science
Our love controls the meaning of words
And art is whatever looks closely
In the human face

If there were only irrational ways
To make the world rational
Art would still be reason
And so our race not left to rot in the madhouse

Reason is the mark of kin
Poetry destroys illusions and doesn’t create them
And hope is a passion that will not let men
Rest in asylum’s peace
EDWARD BOND
