A NOTE BY THE
DIRECTOR

I have so far directed only a few plays
and hardly ever written a ‘director’s

note’. In fact I never suspected the
audiences sensitivi l y and receptivity.
Nor did I ever feel the need for
leading them on. As a director I just
like to play the role of an interpreter
\\ ho is only a link between the two
—-the actor and the audience. A
director to me is an interpreter who
simply solves the language problem—
ﬁlls the communication gap between
the two—w it h an element of
honesty. That’s all his role is about.
That is why in certain ways he is
non-existent. I try to play the same
role, not becoming any kind of an
artiﬁcial barrier between the play and
the audience. or to feed them any
‘particular interpretation’.
Begum Ka Takia is now running in
the third year. Till now it has been

very well understood and appreciated,
without a ‘note’. As the ‘note’

was not needed all these years, I do
not feel that it is necessary even now.

I just wished 10 avail of this opportunity to have an informal dialogue
with my audience. But, please don’t
treat this as a formal ‘note’.

My personal opinion is not
important, at least in the context

of this particular play. Therefore,
it would be better to forget the
director as a 'person’ in this

play in order to enjoy the totality of
feeling of this absorbing play.
