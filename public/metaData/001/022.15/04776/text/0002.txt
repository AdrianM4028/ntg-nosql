The author's note

Avudai Akkal, a remarkable 18th century woman saint from

Shenkottai was an advaitin who sang passionately about the
ecstasy of spiritual union with the Absolute. A desolate and
stigmatized Brahmin child widow, she was initiated into Vedanta
by the master S hrid ha ra Venkateso Ayyawal.
Her songs, a radical elision of the metaphysical sublime and
personal devotion are narrated through existential tropes sourced

from daily lite. This made them available to all, especially women
barred from shastroic learning. They also offer a powerful critique
of the oppressive orthodox socio-religious practices of that
penod.

Running parallel is another historical detail from Ayyawal’s lite his encounter with a Chandal iamin - that outraged the Brahmins

as much as the saint's initiation at Avudai into the knowledge at
the Self.

’Transgressing Boundaries',
