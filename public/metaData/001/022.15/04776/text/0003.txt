The d i rector' s note

When Seerna offered her script to me to make a performance with
Di Ii p and herself, I was a bit shaky because of its off-beat content.
The three main characters coming out from Seemaâ€™s script were Avudai Akkal- a child widow, Chandal - an outcaste, and

S hreedha ra Venkatesha Ayyawal- a saint.
We thought of exploring the text without entering into particular
characterizations. The performers, on their part, tried to play

different roles, sometimes shifting to each other's roles as well, so
that they bring out the central idea that the 1self' is not bound by
the body.
This sort of Pakarnattam, or transformation from one character to
another as we see in traditional performance was, therefore,

adapted as the perforrnative language.
Simultaneously, the dancer and the actor also tried to transfer or

transgress their boundaries of dancing and acting.

Our design team has explored through video, light and sound
design the experience, on the one hand, of the large cosmic
space and, on the other, the lived situation of the Chandal. Songs

and the music of sounds are gathered from day-to- day life which
create and un-create, erase and counter-erase personality and
mood .
