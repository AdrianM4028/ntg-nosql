ORUKOOTAM URUMPUKAL
A community of ants — black and red - resides in a valley. It is not
a united group and they always quarrel. On the upper part of the valley
there is a large spider, stretching its blood-thirsty, red tongue outside.

The two races of ants - red and black are hostile to each other. The
spider orders that every day a few ants should come to its presence as

its prey. The black ants opine that the order is applicable only to the red,
while the red ones feel that the order is meant for the black. The spider

makes it clear that the colour of the ant is no problem to it, every day,
without any break four ants should become its prey. The ants think of how
to free themselves from this danger. At last they think that unity is the
only solution and they, forgetting all their enmity and hostility, decide to
fight the spider jointly. and to save their life. They approach the demon
on the mountain to collect arms.
They consider the straws which they collect from the demon as the

weapon to defeat the spider. When they start to go the demon calls them

back and asks them, to tie the straws together. otherwise it is impossible
to fight with the spider. The straws are tied together. They defeat the
spider.

The demon wants its weapon back. The ants recollecting the
shattered straws, make the broom and returns it to the demon. Then the

demon tries to destroy all the ants. .

Some ants have become the victim of the demon, others cry aloud.
The ants decide to act and they join together and attack the demon. The
demon with a' loud voice falls down and the ants again make the sounds

indicating victory.

The ants decide to bury their differences and live together forever.
They understand that unity is strength, and annouce this principle to the
world jointly.
