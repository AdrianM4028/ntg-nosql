Produced by Living Theatre, 24 Parganas

SYNOPSIS
Ahalya is an assemblage of excruciating images projecting woman's oppression.
There is no promise of liberation. Only a tormenting sense of failure. For, the sort
of society that the middle class male has organised for himself, leaves no scope for

equality. She is therefore a mere representative of her traditional and
contemporary reality.

The production is not bound by a convent ional storyline. it is a new point -- here
the woman's hopes, her pains, her deprivations are conveyed with all the sincerity
that has been possible to muster. if these fragments which have been bound
together into a coilage, succeed in conveying that Ahalya is a human being, the play
would have succeeded in its purpose. For , it is not a revolution that is attempted; it
is only an impression that it seeks to engrave.

D l R E C TO R ३ 5 NOTE
Ahalya, like all our other productions, is created in a workshop through the
participating involvement of the actors. ln this process, a written script and a
playwright are rendered futile. We draw our inspiration from folk traditions, rituals
and the martial arts of different regions. For example, in Ahalya, some of the forms
that we have used are Bengal‘s Chhau and Raibanse, Assam's Kabuinaga, Kerala's
Kalari and Tamilnadu‘s Kolat t am. We are however not out to present an attractive
choreography. On the contrary . our aim is to discover roughcut diamonds out of
the prevailing chaos.
