JATR A 'OF OR IS SA

Various forms of traditional folk'theatre are prevalent inQrissa and they are broadly divided into 3 categories,'namelyh
Leelas, Swangas and Jatras. Amongst all the forms, Jatra is
w
[the most vital, popular and living form, Though there are ‘
some formal similarities with the Jatra of.Bengal, it is '

distinctly more operatic in character and the musical contentﬁ
based on folk tUnes, has a characteristic regional flavour;

' गां

Traditionally Jatra is performed as a localised arena theatre,
the audience sitting all round the dais meant for performance,f

Movements of the actors are accordingly stylised..Participation
of the choral group in repeating the song-lines of the actors,‘m
use of stylised prose dialogue and chOreographic moVemcnts.of ‘
the actors are characteristic features. Invariably themes are ~
taken from episodes of the two great epics, Ramayana and

r

Mahabharata.and also from Puranic literature.
There are a number of professional Jatra parties in Orissa,
but unfortunately, they have lately distorted the form by
bringing in cheap filmic-elements..Amateur theatre workers,

however, have diligently renovated the form about a decade
ago and Utkal Jatra Mandali of Bhubaneswar is one such amateur पृ

group who present this evening.a traditional play "KARTAVIRYA“

SANGHAR" written by the most prolific and talented Jatra play—,
wright, Baishnav Pani.
