a humorous interlude between the

shikaris and the guard,

the

latter trying to show off his valour by saying that the
tiger ran away from him frightened.

The Shikaris call a

shephered and ask about the tiger. The shephered promises
to locate it with the sound of Surnai. The tiger re—appears
and the two Shikaris along—with the forest guard kill the
tiger.
They are happy and proud that they ha o killed a tiger
but the guard makes the claim that it is he who killed the

tiger. Finally they decide to ask the tiger who had killed

it. The dead tiger is first asked by the Shikaris but
there is no answer. When the name of the guard was taken
it shakes its head in affirmative.

The guard is happy and

jumps around to express its happiness.

BATTA FATHER

This is one of the most ancient plays in the repertoire
of Bhand Theatre. The theme of the play runs as follows:—
When Rama,

after defeating Ravana comes back with Hanuman

people felicitate him in a festive mood. Artistes are
invited and all start singing and merry making. When the
artistes are sent off, the actors depict agricultural life
of the people from the sewing stage to the harvesting. Then

they begin preparation for a festival in which the actors
depict and redicule the evils of the day — dice-playing,
drinking etc.

They also sing humorous songs

and conclude

the play by thanks—giving in the traditional manner.
