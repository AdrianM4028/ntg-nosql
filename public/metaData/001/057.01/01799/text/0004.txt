Shri Ashokji Paraniape, Director of the Marathi Section of
the Research Centre of INT, Bobrnay has retained the original structure of the folk form with a few interpolations in
the form of improvisatory techniques. This is to adapt the
performance in the context of contemporary theatre
product ions.

Another innovation is, some of the artistes of contemporary
theatre are participating along with some traditional artists.

I n Vag/zya Mum/i traditionally, the story which is enacted is
‘K/zandovac/za Lagin’ because Khandova is the main deity of
the VagIIJ‘a Mara/i artistes.

l n fact the jagran is known as

“K/zandovaclza Jagrarz‘. Occasionally tales from Mahabharata
and Ramayana are also enacted.
Khandova is an

incarnation of Lord Shankara.

The tale

relates his love for the daughter of a shepherd. The girl is
a devotee of Lord Shankara and refuses to marry Khandova,
who appears before her in the guise of an old man. Later
the old man performs many miracles and the girl comes to
know that he is Lord Khandova himself. Their marriage
takes place with pomp and splendour.
