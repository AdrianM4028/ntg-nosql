This was an irnprovisatory play based on the traditional
tale, enacted in the folk art form of Vag/zya Mum/1' Jagran
The traditional story which has been preserved over the
centuries through oral tradition was compiled in a written
form by the traditional Vag/n'a, Shri Shankarrao Dharnnikar,

and re-written in the contemporary structure of a play by
Suresh Chikhale.

The story is a simple narration of Lord Khandova and his
love for his devotee, Banai.

The Lord has a spouse, Mhalâ€”

sabai, who is a loyal wife. But the love which Banai has
for the God, draws him to her dwelling where he goes
incognito. Through the performance of miracles, the Lord
reveals himself to Banai and the marriage or lagin of
Banai with Khandova takes place.

Lord Khandova resides in divine splendour in his abode at
the temple of Jejuri, with his wives, lVlhalas and Banai.
The saint poets sing of the of glory Jejuri in which Lord
Khandova with Mhalsa and Banai, grants boons to his

devotees.
