delight of children the artists dance representing animals
such as a tiger or a fox.

An unusual aspect of Ranma/yem

is the shifting of scenes which is carried out by a clever
convention. The characters on the stage immediately make
a half-turn and stand with their backs to the audience, as a
well arranged curtain, before the next scene begins.

The opera opens with an invocation to Goddess
Sharada and then to Lord Ganesh. It is to be noted that
Goddess Sharada appears on the stage at the beginning of
the performance only in Rmnna/yem whereas in all other
performances Lord Ganesh is invoked at the beginning of a
performance.
The performances take place every year on Gudi-Padwa

and Renaga-panchami. The earlier settlers of the village
called Gaonkers generally
present
Ranma/ri‘em.
The
Gaonkers are also known as Kulii'arz’i or Samrkar. The
accompaniment

is

on

percussion

instruments — D1201,

G/mmat and KantS'a/em.
Ranmalyem was unknown to most Goans until recently.

The Kala Academy in its search and identification of folk
forms combed the jungles of Sattari and Sanguem talukas
and discovered this lost folk medium. Its presentation
attracted the attention of artists and scholars alike, for its
vigour and organised form. The Sangeet Natak Akademi
subsequently granted assistance for the promotion and
preservation of Razzirz(rl)-'enz. The Kala Academy of Goa,
Daman and Diu has now recognised some groups in both

these talukas to develop this form.
