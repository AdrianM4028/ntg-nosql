INTRODUCTION
The

new

research-oriented

production which

is to

be

presented is based on the folk art form of Vaghya Murali,
which is very popular in Kheda Tehsil

in Poona District.
In this art form a group of 3 to 4 male artistes called

Vag/n‘as and 3 to 4 female artistes known as Muralis narrate
a tale through music, dance and dramatic enactments, over
a period of three hours.

This form of narration is known

as jagran. A unique feature of jagran is that the rag/zyas
and nmralis themselves enact all the characters involved in
the story, without a break in the narration.
Vaghya Murali is a very ancient form of folk art, for there
is a mention of the Vag/zya Murali songs in Lali'r which is a
folk art existing from the 11th Century onwards.
Vag/zya Myra/1' Jagra/z has a definite dramatic structure. It
begins with certain religious rituals, during which the
stamna (establishment) of symbols of prosperity and fertility
such as wheat, sheaves of grain etc. is completed. A

mas/zaal (fire brand)

is lit, which burns throughout the

performance.

The performance opens with gana (prayer to Lord Ganesha)
and is followed by panclzapadi, five songs to Lord Shankara.
The play is then introduced and performed by the Vag/rt‘a
Mum/i group.
