KRISHNA PARIJAT OF MYSORE
__ mm mm

Mysore has a strong tradition of Bavalatta,

which literally

means, open—air drama. Yakshagana of the coastal Canara region
and Krishna-Parij at, Doddatta, Sannatta, Sangyabalya, Dasaratta,
etc. in the north Karnataka region are the various forms of
Bayalatta. They difier from each other in presentational
style as well in the organic form.

Krishna—Parijat was originally conceived by a saint-poet,
Apparaly Tammanna on the pattern of a Yakshagana play, but
later Kuligodu Tammanna, another renowned poet—actor, shaped

it into a stageeble form.‘

'

Krishna—Parijat has a highly developed operatic character.
The musical content based on classical ragas, is beautifully
blended with folk and traditional elements. Singing of the
actors punctuated by short crisp prose-dialogue and dance—like
movements of the female characters are the distinctive features
of the form.

Clad in almost their normal dress,

the actors

recreate the episode with powerful rendering of the music.

As the name suggests, the main plot of the Krishna—Parijat
is woven around the mythical celestial flower "Parijata" to
possess which two of the royal~consorts of Lord Krishna -

Rukmini and Satyabhama, vie with each other.

दृ

The troupe presenting Krishna Parijata this evening is led
by Shri lppalal Nadaf Jamkhandi, who has received awards from
the Mysore State Sangeet Natak Akademi for his service to the
traditional theatre of the region.
