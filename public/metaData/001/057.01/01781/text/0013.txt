Director’s Note

Once I happened to go to the ﬂower-nursery just behind the busy
trafﬁc-way of Bahadur Shah Zafar Margin New Delhi. Adjacent to

The Speed

Hundreds of graves dot the yard in all their grirnness. The Keeper
informed me the antiquity of the yard dated back to the Moghul days.
As I stood there, brought by sheer curiosity, I was overcome by a
curious feeling about death, with a fear and anxiety that goes with the

silence and that of the atmosphere, yet something impinged on me

primordial End, the unknown Continual. I knew neither.
As I stood there Death became a subject for dance.

Turning back, soon I was back on the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg,
with all its traffic, the speed, the multitude of Life, and the nonchallance to the pervasive mysteries of Existence. In that fast and
voluminous traffic it seemed anybody could have got killed any
moment, cut short of his fulfilment, as though an abruptly halted
destiny. Yet, I knew, underlying all the uncertainties and abruptness

in our human affairs, is also the calm acceptance of death as the only
certainly that inheres in our personal selves. When the affairs of life
are shouldered and the milieu fulfilled; when there is nothing more
left to be fulfilled, comes the desire to depart: happy and contented, a
willed end.
The episodes in the dance-drama are derived from everyday living,
as we enjoy and confront it in and around ourselves. The theme that runs
through all of them is death— a certainty both glorious and
inglorious.
