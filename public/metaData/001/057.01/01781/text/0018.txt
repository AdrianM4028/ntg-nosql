SACHIN SHANKAR
Groomed at the Uday Shankar Dance Centre, Sachin Shankar
founded his Ballet Unit 28 years ago which made a mark with its first
production RAMAYANA in 1950. A series of successful works
followed that placed him amongst some of the most eminent
choreographers of today.
His creative work has been inspired by the music of Pandit Ravi
Shankar, Salil Choudhury and other eminent artistes. He has made a
consistent effort to incorporate folk and modern dance into his

choreography, to incorporate such modern ideas as a Football
match or the working of a machine into contemporary dance.
He has won kudos at the World Festival in Helsinki (Finland),
Poland, Japan, Turkey etc. and has performed with his troupe widely
all over India.
