Synopsis

This is a dance drama telling the story of
Ganga, both in .ancient mythological terms
and in modern concept. To the universe
today, what is the deep meaning of the sacred
waters of the Ganga? Through the centuries,
men and women have worshipped these

waters Yet today in this country, where basic
values have been destroyed, the Ganga too is
polluted. A mighty cleaning process is being
undertaken this year. But will this cleaning
process be relevant only to the Ganga or to
the people of India? We see it as a symbolic
force to revitalise and re-evaluate our culture
and its basic ideologies.
