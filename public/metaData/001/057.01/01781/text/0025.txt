‘The Peg’ is a dance composition based on a poem by Sarveshwardayal
*‘Saksena— ‘Coat’ winner of the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1983.

Sarveshwardayal’s is a renowned name in the field of contemporary Hindi
literature. His play ‘Bakri' translated into many Indian languages has been
a tremendous success as a stage production and has proved the genius of .
the writer. ‘The Peg’ is a homage to Sarveshwardayal’s achievements as an
exceptional poet.
This particular poem deals with today’s conflict in the search of reality. It
describes the tensions of the individual who is continuously trying to come
to terms with a situation from which he finds no escape. The poet portrays
this through the central charactr who compares himself with a coat which
hangs from a peg. The choreographer has added a further dimension by
introducing ‘the wearer’ of the coat who in fact becomes the coat’s alterago. The situation of the two is asymmetrical in the sense that while the
wearer is totally independent the coat’s identity lies only in its belonging to
the wearer and yet their anxieties are counterparts of a single conflict
within the same individual.
The images of the tree, the storm and earthquake referred to by the poet
are visualised by the choreographer in the form of a group depicting them.
But, the storm which rises within the individual is real and the earthquake
actually shakes the very ground under his feet.
We are all captives of our situation. Are we not all hanging from pegs?
