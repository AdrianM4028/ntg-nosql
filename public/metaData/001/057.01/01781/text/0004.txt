AMALA SHANKAR

Smt. Amala Shankar received her training in dance under Uday
Shankar and while still a very young girl, she gave her first
performance in December 1931 in Amsterdam. Six years later when
Uday Shankar returned to India and opened his Culture Centre at
Almora she joined him as a dancer. In 1942 they were married. She
danced as a member of his troupe, toured the world over, and taught
dance alongside.

Smt. Shankar has continued to dance and choreograph in the same
style, though essentially Indian in spirit, is totally individualistic. Since
the death of Uday Shankar she has carried on with his work.
