SYNOPSIS ' Rain 8: Storm together make the day a mixture of laziness and awe. The
setting is an outer compound of a Temple and worship is conducted by the
Priest of the Temple.
Suddenly there appears a strangely dressed young girl, gay and laughing
followed by some male admirers.

The Priest evidently does not like this and asks them to stop the dancing
and the music. The girl refuses to oblige.
But gradually the girl is persuaded by the Priest to follow a better way of
life,a life dedicated to God instead of this earthly and momentary joy and
desires.
He preaches and teaches her everyday for purity of mind and to be free
from the wor’ldly love & attachment.

Strange is God’s will. The Priest slowly grows restless and unknowingly
finds himself in love with the girl while the girl is drawn towards spiritual lfe.
When the girl finds out the state of mind of the Priest she is shocked and
ﬂies with disgust. The Priest is miserable and is repentant.
" All of a sudden there is sound of music and the noise of the males
surrounding her in her original costume dancing and singing loudly. She
has no more faith in the Priest nor his way of life. Rain continues.
