In which the question is posed— how do» we remain
whole; how do we energise ourselves; how do we renew
ourselves; through principles known in our culture, of
putting the body at the centre of our world connecting it
to community, society, environment, cosmos.

ANGIKA is the story of the body projected through
examining inter-related physical traditions in India. It is
conceived as an alternative to the archaic and decorative
image of dance which reduces it to the status of a
consumable commodity.
The aim is to look at the material origins of dance in India,
freed from the trap of ‘divine origin’ theories. It is to
remind ourselves that body is situated centrally in our
concepts and philosophical traditions as a source
material and as an energising principle.

ANGIKA is conceived as a theatre-in-the-round, as a
cluster of non-linear sequences held together by the
thread of overlapping physical traditions.
SEQUENCE in which body is tuned and centred through
totemic representations that explore the body to the
limits of its possibilities. Body becomes a mediu‘m
between earth and sky, reminiscent of ageless cosmic
images of elemental power.
SEQUENCE in which we see a glimpse of pre-Natya
Shastra society where martial arts developed around the
principles of control, balance, coordination, endurance,
alertness, lightness, tension, relaxation. These were
principles derived from nature, animals, birds, elements,

life activity, work activity — the material foundations
from which the principles of dance evolved later.

SEQUENCE which is examined the progress of this body
language across time leading to a subversion of its
essential energy content:

० First, the transformation of the body as a vehicle to
serve gods, religion, priests.
0 Then, the transformation of the body as a vehicle to
serve kings, courtiers, men. The shift of dance from
temple to court, of its content from ‘bhakti’ to
‘shringara’, of the focus from the abstract divinity of

gods to the concrete ‘divinity’ of kings.
0 Then, the transformation of the body as a vehicle and
victim of moralistic society. Devadasi becomes
‘deivaradiyal’, becomes ‘deivadiyal’ becomes
‘thevadiyal’, becomes ‘thevadiyar’ or a prostitute — a
linguistic transformation equating the devadasi dancer
to a plain prostitute.

SEQUENCE in which we look back to reappraise
ourselves of the power and potency of the human body
— a memory of the past vibrant and alive with images,
symbols, cults, rituals — images of fertile forces, of
women with weapons in their hands, of women riding a
bull, a tiger, a lion, a man.

SEQUENCE in which is pursued a vision of wholeness,
integration, harmony by synthesising the several physical
traditions in an exuberant, joyous ‘tillana’.
