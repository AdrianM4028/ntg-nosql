SYNOPSIS
King Dasaratha is in court with sage Vasistha when sage Viswamitra

arrives. The latter says that while performing a sacrifice he was stopped by
two Rakshasas, Marich and Sabahu. He asks the king to send his eldest

son Rama to destroy the Rakshasas. Dasaratha is anxious as Rama is very
young, but on advice of Vasistha lets Rama and Lakshrnana accompany
Viswamitra.

They make their way through dense forests and come upon dernoness
Taraka. A battle ensues and Rama destroys Taraka.

They go on their way and reach Viswamitra’s ashrama, where the princes
keep vigil. The Rakshasas appear and are destroyed by Rama. The Rishis
rejoice and bless him.

Viswamitra, Rama and Lakshmana leave for Mithila. They come upon
Ahalya, wife of sage Gautama, turned to stone by his curse for yielding to
lndra’s desire. As soon as Rama touches her, the curse is lifted.
On hearing of Viswamitra’s arrival, Janaka, King of Mithila, welcomes him
to his kingdom. One day, Seeta, Janaka’s beautiful daughter meets Rama
and Lakshmana on her way to the temple.

Soon after, Janaka announces a Swayamvara for his daughter. He places
the bow presented to him by Shiva in the assembly and promises Seeta to
whoever succeeds in stringing the bow. All other kings and princes fail.
Rama succeeds and marries Seeta.
