Keibul-Lamjao, the ﬂoating Sanctuary around the Loktak Lake of Manipur
is the home of Sangai, brow-antlered-deer which is known as the ‘animal
that looks at you’. At one time the Sangai population was numerous, and
covered the entire hills and valleys of Manipur. In course of time however,
the population of the brow-antlered-deer reduced, and is now facing a
serious danger of extinction. They have many enemies. And the greatest
of these enemies is man, even to this day.

Legend says—In Moirang principality during the Hunting Festival, Kadeng
Thangjahanba, a young chief was assigned by the King to lead a hunting
expedition. His lady-love, Tonu-Laijing—lembi implored-“My beloved,
please bring a live deer for me”. Kadeng brought her a hind. But when he
arrived... . Tonu—Laijinglembi was taken by the King’s men in a palanquin.
Kadeng-Thangiahanba, disappointed, let loose his hind.

Even today, killing a Sangai is taboo among the Meiteis. It is believed that
this brings pangs of separation.
