Under such conditions the uninterrupted presentation of ‘Dhruvswamini' was difinitiy
enjoyable. Dr. Rastogi took no chances with the play and did not force anything which
would appear a patchwork on Prasad's creation. For one who had seen Karanth‘s direction
of Skandagupta the difference between the two was quite apparent. Karanth's choice of
castume, headgear it all artistes and music were unconvincing Dr. Rastogi in a talk,
appeared to be a perfectionist. It was clear from her choice of Arnrita Sarkari for the lead
role. Her grace and pose befitted the role she was cast in. Also one noticed that stress had
been laid on pronunciation. The incongruity lay in music-especially the one used for the
marching song.

Jay Shanker Prashad's ‘Dhruvswamini' a production by Roopanter, Gorakhpur was
remarkable for its sleekness and good acting. The period costumes, decor and light effects
added to the production values.

In 'Nahush' as a director Dr. Rastogi impressed the audience. The scenes depicting the
asceties carrying a planquin were imaginatively Inacted. Anand Rai as Nahush gave a
good account of himself. Shambhu Tarafdar and Jitendra Pandey as Kathabars acted well.
