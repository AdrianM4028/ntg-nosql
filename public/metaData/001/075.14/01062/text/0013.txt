religion. cultnre and art. in recent past~pre Mughal and Mughal periods, it continued
to be a centre of classical music. folk lore, minature. Part of academic research in this
field is being conducted by Gwalior Shodh Sansthan of Jiwaji University Gwalior
under guidance of Dr. Harihar Niwas Dwivedi.

We at Shanti Bardhan Revival Group are interested in [a] surveying the whole
area, [b] indentify those places rich in folk lore, folk music and folk dance. The urban
and/or semi urban forms shall be immediately documented and classified. After that
SBRG will move into sthinic groups, tribes and adiwasi-which will demand lot of
work, time, efforts. persuation, coaxing and expenses.

Besides areas of Gopachal and Bundelkhand which are lesar known todayS BRG intends to do some intensive work among Bhils, Gonds [and many sub castes
and sub-cultures among Gonds] and the Chhatisgarh belt. Although art lover know
about this region, but what is presented in the name of Bhils, Gonds and Chhatisgarh
need lot of correction, in depth study and re~evaluation.

Besides documentation, classification. record the Shanti Bardhan Revival Group
will do two different things in preserving these fast disappearing art forms.

1.

To include such arnatenir/nonprofessionaI and/or semi~professional groups
in it own repertoire and expose them to audiences all over the country.

2. Invite the Gurus of these and encourage them to teach dances and
theatre forms [in Danut theatre workshops] to experienced and professional artists of

Kala Samooh's folk dance Ensemble.
3. And then urge other dance institutions to conduct such workshop in their
regions with shanti Bardhan Revival Centres active support.

4. And lastly publish the work of the Revival Group with illustrations when
the project is complete. That includes audio visiual [both motion picture and video].
