The president of the ruling party in

a special invitee at the

meeting.

According to him the weak leadership of Mr. Kaushal was mainly
responsible for lack of progress in
the state. A resolution tabled by Mr.

immediate resignation of the Chief
Minister, Mr. Kaushal in view of

K.D. Kaushal will also stand for
elections. Today is the day that
will test his mettle and guage his
skill at the game of politics. The
ﬁrst person he comes across after
his morning prayers is Padma Devi,
his wife, with whom his relationship
is now staid and formal, and in
whose presence he feels an inexplicable twinge of awe. Upon entering
his ofﬁce, his ﬁrst political encounter of the day is with Sudershan
Dubey, President of the State Party
and his chief opponent. Assured of
the dissidents’ staunch support and
bursting with self-conﬁdence, he
puts certain demands before K.D.
