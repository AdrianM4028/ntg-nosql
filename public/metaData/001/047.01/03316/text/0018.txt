P LAYW R | G HT’S NOTE
The seed of Bhookh Aag Hai was blown over to my
mind by a breeze from my distant youth when I used
to dream, along with my friends, about the red dawn
and a classless society, a society without poverty,
without exploitation. without inequality, without hatred,
without hunger.
Our mouths red with paan-juice and our breath occasionally redolent of beer and our heads sporting
imaginary shrouds, we used to stalk the streets
singing "Bhookh Aag Hai—our hands clenched and our

eyes glued to the overarching sky.
Bhookh Aag Hai invokes the anguish of the memory of
those times, it is an effort to quicken the ashes of
those unfulfilled dreams, it is a sort of search for a
surviving spark.

Paradoxically, this play is an elegy for the death of
those dreams and a chant for their resurrection.
