A Note on John 0sborno

John Osborne was born in London in 1929 into a working class

family. His father was a barkeep and occasionally a commercial
artist of sorts while his mother was a Cockney barmaid.
Describing his background he wrote of his mother’s family:
“Even if they did get drunk and ﬁght, they were responding,
they were not defeated . . . To become angry is to care.” He
did not go to university, wrote for trade journals and eventually

drifted into theatre, starting his career as a small-part actor in
1948 in Sheﬁield and later in the fringe productions at the
Royal Court Theatre in London.

LOOK BACK IN ANGER was produced in 1956 by the English

Stage Company at the .Royal Court Theatre. The play was
directed by George Devine, one of the key ﬁgures in the
encouragement of young dramatists. Mary Ure, then Osborne’s
wife, played the role of Alison. The ﬁrst night of the
production, May 8, was to mark a signiﬁcant turning point in

the history of British theatre. Not only was it for England the
most important play of the decade," but it also gave a name tO
the bitterness and anguish of a whole new generation. Never
was a theatrical event so precisely timed as to given in a single
dramatic statement explosive expression to a new consciousness.
Not since the plays of Shaw had the eloquent invective of a
character against the Establishment so seriously jolted the
theatre, playwrights, directors, actors and audience, as this
play did.
It was LOOK BACK IN ANGER that provided a measure of stability

Vito the. Royal Court Theatre and opened the way for other new
३ playwriting talent, apart from winning adherents from already
established and distinguished theatre personalities. Laurence
Olivier acted the chief role of the music-hall comedian in
Osborne’s next play THE ENTERTAINER (1957), while Richard
Burton did the main role in the screen version of LOOK BACK IN
ANGER. Almost each year saw a new play of Osborne’s:
EPITAPH FOR GEORGE DILLON (1958), THE WORLD OF PAUL
SLICKEY (1959); A SUBJECT FOR SCANDAL & CONCERN (1960),

LUTHER (1961) - his next big success, with Albert Finney in
the chief role; PLAYS FOR ENGLAND (1963), INADMISSIBLE
EVIDENCE (1964), A PATRIOT FOR ME (1965), A BOND HONOURED
(1966), THE HOTEL IN AMSTERDAM (1968), WEST OF SUEZ (1971).
