You have instructed me in my hatred for thirty years. You
have perfected it, and made it the blunt, obsolete instrument

it is now. I only hope it will keep me going. I think it will. I
think it may sustain me in the last few months.

Till then, damn you, England. You’re rotting now, and quite
soon you’ll disappear. My hate will outrun you yet, if only for
a few seconds. I wish it could be eternal.
३
I write this from another country, with murder in my brain and
a knife carried in my heart for every one of you. I am not
alone. If we had just the ultimate decency and courage, we

would strike at you —— now, before you blaspheme against the
world in our name. There is nothing I should not give for your
blood on my head.

'

But all I can offer you is my hatred. You will be untouched
by that, for you are untouchable. Untouchable, unteachable,
impregnable.
If you were offered the heart of Jesus Christ, your Lord and
your Saviour — though not mine, alas — you’d sniff at it like
sour offal. For that is the Kind of Men you are.
Believe me,
In sincere and utter hatred,

Your Fellow Countryman
