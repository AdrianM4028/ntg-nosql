In Budapest in 1975 the well
known Hungarian writer Fereiic
Karintliy \ery kindly presented me

with his two plays in their English
translations. While translating one
of them under the title of Garam
Kumra, whose subsequent
performance in May 1983 marked
the ﬁrst production of an original
Hungarian play in India, 1 felt that
the theatre of Hungary should be
more widely introduced to India.
Unfortunately I could read
Hungarian plays onl y in Engl isli,

English, it was produced in Hindi.
