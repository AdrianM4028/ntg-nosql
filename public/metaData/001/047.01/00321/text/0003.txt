The Playwright

Totek (Pri'yi‘atum Tote) written in
1964, is Orkeny‘s best known

play. He says, “when you see it
you will laugh, but hidden
behind that laughter will be a
shudder of fear. That is
why this is not a comedy but a
tr; gi- comedy" ३.
in the world of Orkeny the
scenes which appear absurd to
logic~free wisdom are played
out within inevitable lifes‘tuations, and the playwright
makesa stand for human

dignity threatened by the onslaught
of dehumanisation, A critic writes
that when Orkeny turns the

playwright, was a novelist before
he turned to playwriting. He
believed that a playwright writes
the collective biography of human
beings, that is, by using the device
of a strange tale on stage he
dramatically unfolds before us the
violence of our collective nature.

At the end of Priyaiam Tote, when
Tote is driven to chop the sadistic
Major into pieces, the intention is
to show that there is a limit to
human endurance, and to express
the playwright's faith that in every
humiliated human being there resides
the moral ﬁre of revolt. When
asked as to what question the play
raised and what answer it gave,
Orkeny replied: it asks, do the
oppressed have unlimited endurance?
and it answers, no, a limit comes
when endurance snaps and we

explode into revolt. This
play is an absurd realistic
tragi—cornedy' which contains a
deep social meaning.
Istv'an Orkeny died in 1979.
