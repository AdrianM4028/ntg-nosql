Mahabhoj —-As Seen Through the
Eyes of a Writer
In the long sessions with hIannuji
spanning over the last nine months,
which was the time spent on
adapting the play, she often
modestly referred to the fact that
she had never personally experienced
all the situations she has written
about. Her friendship and
acquaintance with journalists and
writers was obvious from her
conversations, she even mentioned

her close’ knowledge of a man
like Da Sahib on whom she 'had
modelled the character.- As for an
insight into people like Bisu and
Binda, she relied on newspaper and
magazine reports and incidents
recounted by friends. Mahesh
obviously arose from her close
encounter with students whom she
relates to easily, being a lecturer
at Miranda House.
Despite the lacuna she felt in her
actual experience when writing
on political issues andanore
especially on those concerning the
rural areas,one slowly begins to
realize that hIannu Bhandari
is referring to a personal dilemma
through them—that of the validity
of the written word. “In the
context of today’s need to contribute
more concretely to society, is it
not perhaps an indulgence to
write?” she asks.
Besides this there is a concern
and questioning of the written
word per se which runs through

the entire novel (and play) and
constitutes what becomes the
sub-text of the piece. Taking one

form 0r another this questioning
links the different individuals and
groups together so that all these
threads ﬁnally coverage to form the
author’s personal statement. The
central issue which concerns all
four groups viz: the politicians, the
~ police, the journalists and the
rebels is the investigation and
re-investigation of the cause
*‘of Bisu’s death. Both the ﬁrst and

second police reports which are
prepared on the case are critical to
the political destiny of the ruling
party. In short the written word
(document) is crucial. Da Sahib
being a shrewd politician and
administrator, realizes the

signiﬁcance of the written word
and how it can make or mar his
career and image. For this reason

he effects two important actions—i
(l) to buy over a newspaper
which is writing against him so
as to stem adverse public opinion
(2) to order the re-investigation of
the case (i.e. the preparation of
a new report) in order to stem
criticism from his dissident party
members and to regain his waning
popularity in the Saroha
constituency.
When Da Sahib in Se. 8 discovers
that the second report prepared
by Saxena will adversely affect
his candidate’s chances at the
ballot box, he has political instinct
enough not to tamper with ofﬁcial
documents. Instead he threatens
to exposejoravar with Saxena’s
report and punctuates his threat
with a statement that sums up not
only his attitude, but she signiﬁcance
