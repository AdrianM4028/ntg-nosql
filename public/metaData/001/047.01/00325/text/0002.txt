The Author
The image of woman prevailing
in Hindi Stories till the early 19603
conformed to the orthodox ideal.
Burdened by exalted attitudes and
righteous poses this image of noble
femininity remained stiff and
one-dimensional like a cardboard
cut-out. Among the women writers
who shattered this unrealistic
image and introduced a live, vibrant
woman into the Hindi short story
the name of Mannu Bhandari
comes foremost.
Mrs. Bhandari has also enriched
Hindi literature with her depiction
of the cruel realities of contemporary
life in a language which is simple,
direct and refreshingly free of
artiﬁce or contrived effects.
\Vhether writing on a domestic
theme or of the world outside, she

puts her pen unerringly on the
pulse of her times.
So far her published works
include six volumes of collected
stories and three novels of which
Aapka Banti is the most well known.
Her latest novel [VIa/zabhoj, which

exposes the tragic destiny of
the human being in the ruthless
world of today’s politics, has been
adapted for the stage by the
author—a transformation of the
written word into a visual
experience.
Films like Rajnigandha and Swami
which have enjoyed a fair measure
of success have been based on
her writings.
