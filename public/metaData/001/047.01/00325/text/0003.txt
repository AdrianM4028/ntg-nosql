Author’s Note
Writing AIa/zablzoj ﬁrst as a novel
and then as a play were two
different creative experiences for
me. Naturally so, for each art—form has its own peculiar
requirements and conditions. While
the novel was being written, the
Reader’s existence became so much
part of the situations, characters
and issues that it never struck me
as a separate entity. But the play
had to begin with the Spectator.
The continuous presence of the
Spectator in fact influenced the
shape of my work. Then, gathering
the sweep of the novel into
a. tight and effective arrangement
of scenes, absenting my own self
totally and letting dialogue and
action build the characters and
situations, compressing the entire
work into the alotted playing-time
and space—these and other
conditions had to be observed
without distorting the basic meaning
of my work. This continuous
balancing of the content with the
dramatic— form was for me, a
novelist, an entirely new experience.
The whole process deﬁnitely served
to widen and enrich my outlook
and understanding.
Ma/zabhoj, as a novel, is neither
character—oriented nor issue-

oriented. Those kinds of plots are
easily fbcussed around a particular
character or issue which gives a
tight, one-pointed quality to the
work. Mahabhoj is a situationoriented novel, an exposition of the
apolitical atmosphere of today. It

is no more men of vision and high .
ideals who control politics today;
rather, politics has created its
own special breed of characters—
characters whoare compelled not
by their conscience, inner courage
or convictions, but by the pressure
of situations. Such characters
are no more than slaves. The
ambition of each slave is to have
the whip-hand and this vicious
desease is corrupting all the classes
of our society. But does man give
himself up so easily to the pressure
of situations ? Does he not revolt
at all? On this level the novel
is situation-oriented as well as a
protest against ,the existing
situation.
_
The sprawling structure of the
novel with its teeming characters
had to be mercilessly edited,
altered and even re-written to ﬁt
within the given playing time.
This endeavour was shared
equally by Mrs. Amal Allana,
director of the play. The script,
prepared along the lines suggested
by her, underwent so many more
alterations during rehearsals that
it would be more appropriate now
to call it a joint experiment
conducted primarily by Amal
Allana, Prem iVIatiyani and myself.
I am specially grateful to Dr. Shail
Kumari for providing a regional
ﬂavour to the dialogues of the
village characters.
