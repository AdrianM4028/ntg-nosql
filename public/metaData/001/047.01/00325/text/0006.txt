And yet the play is not pessimistic
for it explores the possibility of
generating those moral attributes
which are desirable in the quest
for a clean and ethical democratic
system. These regenerating qualities
manifest themselves in the ﬁgure
of Mahesh, the young student from
the city who has come to Saroha
to do his ﬁeldwork related to
his thesis on “class and caste
. struggle”, which is the same conflict
which the playwright herself has
set out to explore. We, the
audience, then begin to perceive
the play through Mahesh’s eyes, as
it were. We witness his descent
into the real and seething class and
caste tensions which manifest
themselves in the events that take
place in Saroha. In an attempt to
exist truthfully both socially and
personally Mahesh becomes at ﬁrst
a concerned yet hesitant participant
and ﬁnally one who is willing to
commit himself totally to action.

through characters like Rukma,
Saxena and Mahesh as they try to
prevent Binda from resorting to
violence and revenge. Instead she
banks on the educated, urban
student, Mahesh, whose sensitivity,

rationality and consistancy are
necessary ingredients to carry on
the long and persistant struggle.
Thus Mahesh becomes, to some

extent, the central protagonist
of the play although structurally
he is only related obliquely to the
main action. This has to do with
the manner in which Mannu
Bhandari has conceived of the
play and herself within the frame
work she has set up. For if
anything, Mahesh is deﬁnitely the
writer’s spokesman. For the ﬁrst
half then, Mahesh theatrically
exists on the periphery of the play
which is in keeping with his
reluctance to become involved. As

his engagement intensiﬁes the

playwright gently shifts him
towards prominance and only
ﬁnally does she completely focus
on him. Thus by not giving us
a deﬁnitely central character we
note that the playwright is
attempting to maintain a balance
so that we can view the events
as unbiasedly as possible. In keeping
with this objectivity the end of
the play is neither despairing nor
of the audience. Binda, we realize,
naively optimistic. The audience is
does not posses the lasting stamina
led to the point where lVIahesh
and rationality to carry on Bisu’s
is fully aware both of the situation
struggle. This is a kind of blind
and his potentialities. What he
fury that can only lead to disaster
will do with his awareness and
by consuming itself in one large
knowledge of this experience is left
act of violence. NIannu Bhandari
senses this and voices her reservations u nsai d.

It is interesting to note that
Mannu Bhandari avoids the
romantic approach of casting a
Harijan in the role of protagonist
to ﬁght oppression and violence.
The Harijans are the victims.
Nor does she cast Binda whose
theatrical character is suited to
the role of arousing the emotions
