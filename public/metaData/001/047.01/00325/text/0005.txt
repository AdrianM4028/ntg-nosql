Director’s Note
Mahabhoj—A Documentary
AIahab/zoj the title of the play and
“Vultures peeked at the abandoned
corpse of Bisesar,” the opening lines
of the novel express both succinctly
and precisely the author’s manner
of perceiving and interpreting
the events she sets out to narrate.

If the characters in Mahabhoj
do not literally feast on the corpse
of Bisesar and each other, they
effectively do so by destroying the
humanity and moral scruples in
themselves. This then becomes the
central theme of the work.
Brieﬂy the play reveals the class
and caste conﬂict inherent in
today’s society and how it is
engineered and inﬂamed in the ﬁght

relentlessly attacks the power of
privelge and the evils of a corrupt
society where oppression and
violence are witnessed everyday
and where most of the characters
see no alternative but to take part
in, and thereby perpetuate the
existing situation with the eventual
scene of feasting erupting as a
nightmare. As an ironic backdrop
to this enacted drama of the
Great Feast: .\Iannu Bhandari has

the phantom— like, omnipresent
Bapuji, the father of Indian

democracy. Relegated to becoming
merely lifeless symbols in the new
order of things, I\Iannuj i comments
on Gandhi and Nehru :—
“T/zc country nererforgol Gandhi and
Nehru for a moment. One (oula'ﬁnd

for political supremacy. Through

with their presence, though lo be sure,

each scene Mannu Bhandari

only in lifeless pictures.”
