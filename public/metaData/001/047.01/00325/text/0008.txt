public by the newspapers is the
second area which Mannu Bhandari
explores in questioning the value
of the written word. The will'ul
sensationalization of events through
the written word is explicately
revealed in the attitudes of the

editors ol“'i\lashal”. Here too truth
is twisted around with words for
ulterior motives. \Vhen Da Sahib

subtly bribes this organ of “public
conscience” as he calls it, the

attached to the written word in
our system offunctioning. “As long
as it remains simply verbal, its
nothing special. But once its in the
ﬁle, it becomes difficult!” VYith

Joravar, Da Sahib is shown to be
interpreting Saxena’s report
the way Saxena intended, but for
his own ends. A while later in the
same scene Da Sahib deliberately
misinterprets Saxena’s report
before the D.l.G., manipulating it
to suit his own purpose. \Vhat
then is the relevance of the
written word? Can it not fully and
clearly express the truth? In this
shocking scene of his revarsal of
stand 'Da Sahib explodes the myth
of the adequacy of words.

The ‘facts’ as supplied to the

journalists reverse their stand and
prostitute their work without any
qualms of conscience. Thus the
written word becomes a
dangerous weapon in the hands of
the unscruplous.
The actual truth concerning the
burning of the Harijans which
points a ﬁnger at the murderer of
Bisu is contained within the written
proofs that Bisu had compiled.
Ironically, these documents never
see the light of day.
However, the most signiﬁcant
questions Mannu Bhandari raises
concerning the validity of the
written word are expressed through
Mahesh. His decision to given up
writing his thesis in favour of
direct action arises from his
growing awareness that reality can
not be studied through books
and neither can commitment be
expressed through writing.
His outburst at the police station
in Sc. 7A is revealing:—
“ Only books can provideyou with such
simplistic and ready-made answers, and
howfalse is the world of books—a
farce! how can one known reality without
total involvement?”
