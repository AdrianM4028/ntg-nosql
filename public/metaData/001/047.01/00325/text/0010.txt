exerts pressure upon them and to
which they contribute. It is the

context which throws light upon
various aspects of these characters
and not vice-versa.
The eleven scenes of the play are
spread over about one month and
their construction is such that they
become episodes ftom the lives of
these people. What comes between
the Scenes is not presented for it
is both unnecessary and at the same
time implies that the ‘gaps’ are
taken up with the same motivated
exploitation. Thus the structure
denies overall coherence of
Character in the traditional
Aristotalian sense.
The style of acting, then, arises
from a particular view of the world
held by the playwright, a view
of how people react to their
circumstances. What is being done
to the character and what does the
character do? Since one is describing
the process of society in Afa/zab/zoj
it is very often a question of what’s
being done to the character. What
one sees here is not a character
going from a to b to c, but a
character whom we see from point
a, point I) and point 6. What is,
therefore, asked of the actor is to
act the situation. It is pointless
asking “How did I get there?”
Rather in a play of this sort the
actor should ask “How did it (the

situation) get there? The situation
are designed by the writer not
to show the development of his .
character but to show the crucial
situations he has to cope with in
order to produce what is of value to
him. Each scene can therefore only
be played with reference to itSelf
and to that speciﬁc situation.
It is possible, but misdirected to
attempt to play a scene purely in
terms of the preceding scenes.
To do so implies a steady growth
of character and a situation
designed to demonstrate growth of
character. Instead each scene is
written as an entity with no
possibility of dissolving into the
other. The actor therefore has to
play the moment and allow the
audience to thread these moments
together.
The ability to watch the play with
a degree of detachment is certainly
the intention both of the play
and the production. For this reason
the play emphasises development
of events and situations rather than
the internal growth of characters.
For the actor, therefore, in such

a play it is important to interptet
roles as social roles or social
functions, to deﬁne themselves in
relation to other characters
and to consider the nature of
the action rather than the nature
of the self.
