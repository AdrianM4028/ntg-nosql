The Playwright

Totek (Priyatam Tote) written in
1964, is Orkeny’s best known
play. He says, “when you see it

you will laugh, but hidden
behind that laughter will be a
shudder of fear. That is
why this is not a comedy but a
tra gi - comedy ’ ’ .
In the world of Orkeny the
scenes which appear absurd to
logic-free wisdom are played
out within inevitable life-

situations, and the playwright
makes a stand for human

dignity threatened by the onslaught
of dehumanisation. A critic writes
that when Orkeny turns the

absurd into the human he does
not mean to say that man must

ultimately give up in despair,
Istvan Orkeny, modern Hungarian

playwright, was a novelist before
he turned to playwriting. He
believed that a playwright writes
the collective biography of human

beings, that is, by using the device
of a strange tale on stage he
dramatically unf’olds before us the
violence of our collective nature.

on the contrary this style of
his becomes a vehicle for social
citicism.
At the end of Priyatam Tote, when

Tote is driven to chop the sadistic
Major into pieces, the intention is
to show that there is a limit to
human endurance, and to express
the playwright’s faith that in every
humiliated human being there resides

the moral ﬁre of revolt. When
asked as to what question the play
raised and what answer it gave,
Orkeny replied: it asks, do the
oppressed have unlimited endurance?
and it answers, no, a limit comes
when endurance snaps and we

explode into revolt. This
play is an absurd realistic
tragi-comedy which contains a

deep social meaning.
Istvan Orkeny died in 1979,
