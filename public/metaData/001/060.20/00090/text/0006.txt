trying to save
girl as a Muslim daughter, only to repay the moral debt of his old cherished friendship.
Sharmaji still cherishes his lively child hood friendship with Gafoor and the gap

created by the partition of our country in 1947 has tarnished his dreams. The boundries laid by man has separated two loving hearts and the threads of the old friendship
has been lost.

Abdul remembers the frienship of two bosom friends Shambhu Er Shafiq who
got other friend's name tatooed on their arms but they had to pay a heaVy cost
for it when Shafiq was slaughtered by the people of his own religion and Shambhu
had to cut his own arrnzbecause he felt that he was responsible for the curse on his
friend Shafiq
The exploration of past and the question thus emerged does not go

fruitless

and prove to be a powerful landmark in the transformation of the heart of the indifferent Sikh youth and his sentiments burst out with a powerful rejection of the violence.
Let us hope that our this small gesture prove to be an important link in explora-

tron of peace and truth in our motherland.
