“Athan Wele", the Punjabi version of J. P. Das’s Oriya play. One cannot forget the
scintillating performance that entertained the Delhi audience with “Murghi Khan" by
Kewai Sood .

NOW the group is going to stage another of Kewal Sood's play “Kata Hua Saw".
I am sure that it will be of as much entertainment to the audiences of Delhi as the
previous stage performances of the group had been. It is for the Delhi theatre fans to
see to it that they patronise such groups in such an over whelming manner that they
do not have to have long pauses between performances.
