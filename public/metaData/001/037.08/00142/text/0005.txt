Director’s Note
Basant Jagrit is a Hindi Translation of Frank Wedekind’s ”Spring Awakening.’

V

Written in 1890, the play is as relevant today as it was iconoclostic then.

Conceived’

only a decade after “Doll’s House", it seems a creation a century apart.

The play

moves through vigorous vignettes into the slower moving finale with the adults.

All

through, it is as vital as Wedekind’s own life; which had left Bertolt Brecht thoroughly
impressed by this "man of tremendous energy. ”

The play reveals the deep hypocrasies prevelant in society about the sexual
attitudes

and

mores

symbolised

by

the growth

of eight children.

While they'

remain in total darkness about the truths of life, they get stiﬂed by the educational;
institutions.

While one boy ends his life after failing in the exams, another is.

sentenced to the Remand Home.

One of the girls accepts her fate of being beaten

at home, another gets pregnant and dies in abortion.

Finally, in the graveyard, the

two boys meet — the fugitive from the remand home and the spirit of the dead boy.
Just as both are about to be united, the Man in the Mask arrives and whisks
the alive

boy away —— “to experience life and the living.”

Ultimately leading as to believe im

self determination.

The process of work was difficult with actors and
actresses running into
difficulties about depiction of 15—16 year olds.
The innate vigour of the script and
the vitality of imagination led us to solutions.
