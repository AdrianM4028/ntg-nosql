“Director Nigam Prakash has evidently
rehearsed the play extensively with his players because each one of them carried his
or her lines quite eﬂortlessly, or rather,
adroitly, and managed also to combine
superb/y wit/1 others. Sushma Mehra convinced us that no one in the Delhi amateur
theatre can wench around with such aplomb
and, indeed, sophistication as she did this
evening in a very exacting role which placed

her between three men—all in their ways
diﬂicult to satisfy. Prakash Mirchandani
as her self-eﬁacing husband dropped hardly
a single false note in a very full (with well

worded lines) part. Siddharth Kak

made

aﬁttingly exuberant young lover.”

the extreme. Sushma Mehra, Prakash

Mirchandani and Siddharth Kak provide an
