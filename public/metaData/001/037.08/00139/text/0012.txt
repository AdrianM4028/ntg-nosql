by frederic knott

[3A popular thriller which has been staged
and ﬁlmed successfully in the West, DIAL
M FOR MURDER,

was adapted

into

Hindi by Kewal Kapoor. In this play the
problem is not to ﬁnd the murderer but

with the murderer known from the begin—

towards Rachna, acts only as a starter.
Once the thought of murder occurs in his
mind, the money motive dominates completely. He bends Michael to his will by his
shrewdness and cunning, but the best
laid plots are liable to miscarry. So it is

in this case— Michael gets killed accidentally instead of Rachna. Rakesh

writer of crime stories displays his theoretical skill in collaboration with Iqbal
Singh, the astute though stereotyped inves-

ning, the problem is to unravel the machinations of his plot.

an established evil character,
who he
knows has been indulging in underhand

dealings. His motive is to grab Rachna’s
enormous wealth, willed in his favour, in

order to live comfortably through life
when his tennis career has come

to an

end. The faint streak of jealousy shown
