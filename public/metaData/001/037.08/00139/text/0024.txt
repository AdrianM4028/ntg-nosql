“Play wit/z a Joyous Mood”.
Comedy in the English theatre has been
largely sentimental. The formula has been
one part acetic acid and nine parts saccharine. Sentimental comedy allows enough
license as long as we are kept on the leash
of convention...Ann Jellicoe develops a

comedy from

situations and

shifts in

relationships. ..In her lines and situations we
are often reminded of the ingrained realities of our everyday life.
The story, or rather the situation revolves
round Nancy (Anita Seal) who inno-

cently stumbles into the digs of

three

young men : The extrovert Tolen (Kabir
Bedi) claims to have the knack with

girls. Colin (Mohan Varma) is an introvert longing to learn the knack and
Tom (Lawrence Bantleman) is hardly
bothered with

the

Tom is a capable funny man. He helps
maintain balance between the extremes

about each other in the process.
Their
characters are revealed by their hopes,

fears, and palpitations.”

Yatrik’s final offering
of the season,
THE KNACK by Ann Jellicoe started
out by giving us a glimpse of a nutty
threesome—Tom, Colin, and Tolen—who
lo and behold, are soon joined in their
pad by an equally neurotic girl, Nancy.
They are all types who yearn to be individuals. Tolen, the strong aggressive youth,
is the kingpin who bosses over everyone
and boasts of his knack for getting the
girls, as he terms it. . . .

With its cast of four, Yatrik’s THE

Not much of a plot—Miss Jellicoe too
agrees, but if we may quote her “You see,
