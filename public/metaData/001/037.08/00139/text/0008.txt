DEMAGH

KA,

a Hindustani adaptation by Ken'al Kapur
of George Axelrod’s hilarious comedy
The Seven Year Itch. . . . .it is a measure of

Yatrik’s reputation for good theatre, and
of public response...that the performance
drew a full house.
Kapoor, who also directed Sunday’s production, has a

creditable adaptation in

‘Khalal Hai Demagh Ka’. The language is
colloquial, the erotic pursuits at home in

Delhi. The delusions of romance, raddled
with timidities and hesitations, the crabwise
approach of middle-age to illicit love;
these evoked understanding mirth among

the audience.
