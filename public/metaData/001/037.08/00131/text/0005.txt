DAY TIME :

THE STAGE OF A THEATRE

The play has neither acts nor scenes. Its performance will be
interrupted twice ; once—-though the curtain will not be lowered
—when the PRODUCER and the principal CHARACTERS go
away to write the script and the ACTORS leave the stage,

There will be a 15 minute interval between Act | & Act II.

YATRIK is deeply grateful to the Canadian High Commission
and to all those who have assisted with this production.
