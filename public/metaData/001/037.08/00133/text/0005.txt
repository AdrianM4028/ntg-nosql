We are deeply grateful to

Max Mueller Bhawan for their interest and support

for the theatre movement in the capital by making available to theatre groups this
intimate Studio Theatre.

YATRIK is fortunate to be the ﬁrst to use it.

Our special gratitude also goes to Maya Rao, Director of the Institute of Choreo—
graphy and her staff and students, who have contributed an important visual
dimension to the play.

and to the many others who have assisted with this production.
