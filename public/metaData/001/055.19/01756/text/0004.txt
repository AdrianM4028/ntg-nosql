been ably assisted in this by Guru Olek Niranjan Bisoi &
Guru Sai Baba. Similarly, the music composed by Shri
Atul Desai, while retaining a totally Indian flavour,
manages to make a fusion of the classical and the
contemporary—the latter especially in the audio compre-

hension of the state of Manu and Shraddha when they
attain spiritually a higher level of consciousness.

Tapas Sen’s lighting is different from that in other ballets
in as much as he will be using light effects and
projections to highlight the dance and music sequences
on a theme which is basically philosophic in nature.
