SHRIRAM' BHARATIYA KALA KENDRA
For any institution, the completion of 35 years is a
landmark- and an occasion for happiness and self congra-

tulation. For Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra, which started
in _a very small way but has been able to revive many
dying arts notably Kathak and now Chhau, to have
established a College of Music and Dance which has
produced many artistes of high professional excellence,
to have made dance ballet a living medium, and popula—
rised among the masses, both in India and abroad an
appreciation of the best in Indian culture, is a significant
achievement.

MAYURBHANJ CHHAU STYLE
This dance style has evolved from the original tribal and
folk movement in the regions of Bihar, West Bengal and
Orissa. Since it was patronised by the monarchs of the
past and was eventually elevated to the stature of a court

and abroad. Hence the viewer and particularly, a student
of dance, will discern a peculiar and beautiful combination
of the stylization and detail of classical form, juxtaposed
with the martial character of the tribal flavour and the
natural carefreeness of the folk idiom.
Mayurbhanj Chhau hails from the district of Mayurbhanj
in the state of Orissa. Traditionally, it has been a
male-oriented art-form, with men also playing the part of
women, wherever the theme of a dance piece demanded
