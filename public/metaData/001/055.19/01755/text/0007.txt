he goes to sleep with his head on Karna’s lap and an insect bites Kama and
blood begins to flow. But he remains unmoved. Parshuram awakes and curses
Kama for deceiving him that he is a kshtriya and not a Brahmin. He curses him,

that at the crucial moment Kama would forget the strength of the words.
imparted to him in training.
SCENE X
The dice game is on amongst the Kauravs and Pandacs. The Pandavs lose their
Kingdom and also ﬁnally their wife, Droupadi. She is brought to the assembly
and is rudely disrobed by the Kauravs. Kama protects Droupadi’s chastity by

covering her, with the only sacred garment he had — a shawl.
SCENE XI
In order to avert a ﬁerce battle at Kurukshetra, Krishna and Kunti go individually to Kama and tell him of his real parentage. Kama, however, tells them that

this knowledge has come to him too late and that he is indebted to his friend

Duryodhan and that it would be cowardly to let him down at the last moment.
He also tells Kunti that apart from Arjun he would the lives of all her other four
sons and thus she would always be the mother of ﬁve.

SCENE XII
The Mahabharat war is on and Kama is made leader of the Kaurav’s army.

Yudhishtar, Bhim, Nakul and Sahdev all come before Kama but due to the
promise he had made to his mother he spares them their lives. Krishna himself
speaks to Arjun and extols the war-like and humanitarian virtues of Karma.
A ﬁerce battle ensues between Kama and Arjun but as fate would have it the

wheels of Kama’s chariot get stuck in mud. He is attacked from all sides by
Arjun, under the instructions of Lord Krishna. Kama pleads to Arjun for a war of
equality. Krishna tells Arjun to immediately kill Kama.
Kama realises that his end has come and lays down his weapons. He looks up to
the shining Sun who was not only his father but had also been his mentor. Arjun
shoots and arrow and Kama’s end comes tragically.
Kunti is heart broken at the death of her son. Krishna, however, extols the
virtues of Kama and tells her and all the Pandavs that even in death, victory had
been Rama’s.
