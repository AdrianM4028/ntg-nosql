condensed and presented as solos, ducts and group dances — as the need may
be .
The ultimate aim for him was to classify Chhau as a classical dance form and it is
heartening to note that institutions such as the Sangeet Natak Akademi and the
local State Kala Parishads are presenting Chhau along with other dance styles
and thereby giving it the status of a classical dance form.
'lhe two ballets being presented this evening are Khajuraho and Karna which
were the two famous ballets of Guru Krishna Chandra Naik. Khajuraho, especially. was appealing to him because he was able to defy all people who had

thought that Chhau was a martial dance form . He showed with the movements
in Khajuraho, that Chhau can be lyrical and pristine in quality on the one hand
and martial on other.

Karna was another famous ballet ofhis, in which, for the ﬁrst time, he made use

of the spoken words alongwith Chhau movements.
The choreography of these ballets has been based on Mayurbhanj Chhau style

by Guru Krishna Chandra Naik. Many choreogrphic innovations are there in as
much as that even for communication of abstract ideas almost complete
reliance has been on dance movement.
There will also be two traditional Chhau dances presented, Nataraj and Dandi.

These items were presented by Krishna Chandra Naik himself during his life at
the Courts of the Maharajahs; and he was famous for these two items. He has

taught these items to dancers in the Kendra one of whom will be presenting
them.

SBKK hopes that with the presentation of these two evenings of Chhau dances.
it can pay, in a very small way, homage to a great Guru who contributed much
not only to the status of SBKK but enabled it to produce leading dancers who
have made a niche for themselves in the ﬁeld of Chhau. Indeed, Krishna

Chandra Naik‘s dream that Chhau Should be accepted as a classical dance form
has come true.
