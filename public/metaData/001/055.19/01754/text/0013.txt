Tansen sings a composition of Surdas in Akbar's
Court. Akbar expresses his desire to meet Surdas.

Surdas is old. He is narrating Udhav Leela. Udhav
comes to Gokul on the errand of Krishna who is in
Mathura now. He preaches the significance of Yoga
philosophy to the Gopies. The Gopies believe only

in Bhakti (devotion through love).

They render him

speechless by their counter arguments. He gets converted to their views and returns to Krishna, a defeated person.

Akbar comes to meet Surdas. He requests him to
sing. One of the courtiers wants Surdas to sing some
lines in praise of Akbar. Surdas starts singing, but
the song is again on Lord Krishna. Akbar immediately realises the total involvement of Surdas in Krishna
and returns leaving him in peace.
Surdas feels his days are numbered. He starts recollecting some of his compositions and the various
incidents of his life. Finally he sees Krishna dancing
Maharas with Radha and other Gopies. As Maharas

is going on, his life starts ebbing. His poet friends
come to give him support. But he is sinking. He
shuffles off his mortal coil at last, his soul merging in
the Divine.
