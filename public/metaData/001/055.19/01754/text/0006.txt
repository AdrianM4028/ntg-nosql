performer. Her talent for research and innovation
has not only added to the repertoire of the Radha-

Krishna legend but has also brought to light the
glorious tradition of the Brij Raas of Vrindavan in
relation to Kathak by adapting to the style the works
of Ghalib, Tagore and Bacchan under the guidance
of Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan and Smt. Naina Devi.
