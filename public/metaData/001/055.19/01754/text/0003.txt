The Bharatiya Kala Kendra has consistently
nurtured talented artistes and not only

brought fame and renown to them but, through

their efforts, presented to an aesthetic
and discerning audience some of the finest

diSplays of the performing arts. It is in this
tradition that the Surdas Ballet is being

presented on 27 February 1976, directed by
the noted Kathak Artist Kumari Uma Sharma,

an old student of the Kendra.
I send my very good wishes for the success

of this performance.
