“Fast, uncluttered and entertaining. . . murderous/y magical. " The Observer
Foreign travel for any theatre company is a very exciting
prospect, doubly so for Northern Broadsides as the
company is only two years old. The invitation to India
came after a performance of “The Merry Wives” in a
disused cloth mill in Oldham, Lancashire — a typical
playing space that reflected handsomely the vibrant
qualities of the cast and the production.

We promise our Indian hosts and audiences a sense of fun,
a commitment to Shakespeare’s language and a generosity
of spirit that recognises no international boundaries.

All this would be impossible without that same generosity
so warmly provided by Standard Chartered Bank and the
British Council.

To all who made it possible, many thanks.

Broadsides is a company
whose arrival is very
welcome indeed. ”
