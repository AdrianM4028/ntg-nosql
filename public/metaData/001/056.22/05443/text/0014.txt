British High Commission
British Council Division

I feel extremely fortunate that my arrival
in India to take over leadership of the
British Council’s most important
overseas operation should have coincided
with such an exciting cultural event as
the tour of India by Northern Broadsides
with Shakespeare’s The Merry Wives. I
should like to pay tribute to the
generosity of the Standard Chartered
Bank which has cosponsored the tour,

and indeed without whose support it
would not have been possible at all.
Colin Perchard, OBE

The British Council Division has brought
many British drama productions to India
over the years, and all have agreed that
the Indian public represents one of the
most discerning theatrical audiences to be
found anywhere in the world. I am
confident that they will thoroughly enjoy
the vitality and originality of what is the
first production of The Merry Wives to
have been brought here by a British
company. At a time when the
entertainment world is increasingly
dominated by the electronic media, the

tour should once again demonstrate the
magic of the live theatre, and show that in
India, as in Britain, 3 Shakespeare play is
still an important event.
