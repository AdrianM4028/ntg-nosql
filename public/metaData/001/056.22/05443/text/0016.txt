It’s not just what he said or did,
it’s all the times he was there for you.

Remember how secure you felt
when he was by your side? You
knew that you could talk to him
and he would listen. You knew that
if you had the questions, he had
the answers.
Never far away, your bulwark
in times of need. Sturdy, safe, reliable.

And that is just the kind of
relationship our customers and staff

share at Standard Chartered Bank.
A family relationship. Where
listening, confidence in each other
and relying on one another go
hand in hand. Like any tightly—knit
if extended, family.
And extended it is indeed. With
millions of customers connected by
a network of over 700 locations in
more than 50 countriesAnd a history

stretching back 140 years, of which

over 154 have been spent in India.
Naturally, the ways and customs
of this land have become our own.
And naturally, in the future‘
as it has always been in the past,
if our customers call us they need
never worry.
Standard Chartered Bank is
always there.

The international family you can bank on.
