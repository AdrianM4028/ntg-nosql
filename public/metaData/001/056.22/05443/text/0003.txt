Standard हु Chartered

Standard Chartered Bank is delighted to have this opportunity to
join with the British High Commission, British Council Division,
in sponsoring Northern Broadsides tour of India. Their UK
production of Shakespeare’s The Merry Wives under the direction
of Barrie Rutter received wonderful reviews and I am sure that
audiences in India will be equally enthusiastic.

This tour forms part of the cultural activities surrounding the
Indo-British Partnership Initiative promoted by Prime Ministers
Rao and Major in early 1993. It coincides with a week of business
related activities in Bombay, when business persons from the
United Kingdom and India will meet with the prime objective of
identifying trading and investment opportunities for the mutual
benefit of both countries.
Standard Chartered can readily identify with the aspirations of the
IBPI — after all our Indo-British partnership started in 1858. It is
therefore appropriate that we should be actively involved in this
major trade promotion in what is our 135th anniversary year.
The logistics involved in organising such an extensive tour are
enormous. I therefore wish to thank the staff of the British High
Commission, British Council Division for their dedication and
hard work, without which this tour could not have taken place. I
also greatly appreciate the help and support of the Indian
Government agencies, which have made it possible for The Merry
Wives to come to India.
On behalf of everyone at Standard Chartered, I do hope this
production of The Merry Wives will give you much pleasure.
