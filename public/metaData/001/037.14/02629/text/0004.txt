REMEMBER

The Greatest remedy for anger is delay.
Anger is a mornentry madness

United we Unisted.

Divided we fell.

Character must be kept bright as well as clean.
No one reaches a high position without boldness.
Justice is the end of Government.
Generosity IS the flower of justice.
Truth never hurts the teller.
True principle of humanity is justice.
Truth is the highest thing that man can keep.
