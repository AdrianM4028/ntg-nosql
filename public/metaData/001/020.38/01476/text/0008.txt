THE GLASS MENAGERIE
ABOUT THE PLAY
The Glass Menagerie (1944). ‘Memory play’ in which Tom Wing
Field recalls his life in St. Louis with his mother Amanda, a former
Southern belle deserted by her husband, and his sister Laura, a shy,

slightly crippled girl who takes refuge from the world in her collection of glass animal figures. Amanda attempts to keep her children
upto the social level to which she aspires. She sells magazines-ubscriptions by telephone, tries to make her daughter learn stenogra-

phy in order to be economically independent, and Nags Tom to
bring ‘gentleman callers’ to meet his sister. During a quarrel with his
mother, Tom accidently smashes Laura ’3 menagerie before fleeing
to cape into the dream world of the movies. On his return, Laura
persuades him to apologize to Amanda. Recriminations follow, and
Amanda reveals that she knows Tom plans to join the merchant
marine. She urges him first to provide for his sister by bringing home
a young man from the shoe warehouse in which he works. Tom
brings his co-worker Jim to dinner. Amanda conspires to leave

Laura and Jim together, and although Jim, whom Laura once knew
and admired in high school, mindlessly parrots the American suc—
cess myth, he sparks affectionate responses in Laura and is in turn
momentarily charmed by her senstivity. However, he soon confesses that he is already engaged and leaves. Tom explains how he
finally followed his fater’s example and abandoned his family as the

audience views a pantomime scene in which Amanda comforts
Laura. Although he has attempted to flee, Tom is persuaded by the
haunting memory of his sister.
