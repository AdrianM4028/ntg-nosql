DIRECTOR'S NOT E

Moliere Tennessee William. Johan Galsworthy.
Choosing to stage play written by them is somewhat like choosing
the works of great playwrights.

‘The Glass Menagerie' and ‘The First and the Last', it has been in my
mind for a long time to stage these plays and finally my this desire
is now fulfilled. The encouraging response to our earlier production
Moliere'siVlock Doctor' inspired me to repeat it. I decided to do a
festival of the three plays.

The three plays show different moods. ‘Mock Doctor' is a satire. The
Glass Menagerie' represents the frustrations of the youth in the
middle class. ‘The First and the Last' exposes the Showmanship in
the society. It was indeed a big challenge to do these classics
simultaneously but i accepted it.
i and my team are cautious about the quality of our productions.
The result of the hard work put in by the team is now before you.
it rust this will be enjoyable experience to the actors as well as to

the audience.
