beaten. A few good blows serve to convince Mustaid M ion and he
is taken to Salaamat Khan’s house, where he begin to enjoy the
attention paid to his absurd medical jargon. Learining that Najjo is
in love with Mehboob Ali and is only pretening to be dumb to avoid
marriage, that her father wishes to impose on her, Mustaid Miyan

Mustaid Main to make her mute again. Of course Mustaid Miyan
cannot do this, but he offers to make Salaamat Khan deaf instead.

marriage upon hearing that Mehboob Ali just inherited his uncle’s
fortune. The play ends as he forgives Mustaid Miyan his part in the
plot.
