About the play... .

There is nothing in M. Argan’s physical system which does not require special
treatment, but the bills entailed make him feel inﬁnitely worse.

The only star in his sky

is the marriage he has arranged between his daughter Angelique and Thomas Diaforus,
the doctor son of a famous physician.

A physician in the family should ensure constant

perhaps for nothing.

medical attention for him —-

He does not know that Angelique is in love with Cleante and is

determined to marry him.

Even worse, Beline his wife, and Angelique’s stepmother, is

scheming with her lawyer, Bonnefoy, to bleed him of a part of his fortune.

It is left to

Toinette, an inventive maid, and Beralde, Argan’s brother to devise a scheme whereby
Toinette persuades Argan that his doctors, and especially Diaforus, pere et fi/s, are
Charlatans : to deal with Belin and show Argan those who really love him.

All ends

happily for Angelique and Cleante but Argan is still left without a doctor .... or is he?
