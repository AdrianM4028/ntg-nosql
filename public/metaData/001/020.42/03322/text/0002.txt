ABOUT TH E_ P LAY
“Final Solutions”, has a powerful contemporary resonance as it
addresses an issue of utmost concern to our society—the issue
of cornrnunalisrn. The play presents different shades of the
cornrnunalist attitude prevalent among Hindus and Muslims in
its attempt to underline the stereotypes and cliches influencing
the collective sensibility of one community against another. What
distinguishes this work from other plays written on the subject
is that it is neither sentimental in its appeal nor simplified in its
approach. It advances the objective candour of a social scientist
while presenting a mosaic of diverse attitudes towards religious
identity that often plunge the country into inhuman strife. Yet the
issue is not rnoralised as the demons of communal hatred are
located not out on the street but deep inside ourselves.
The play moves from the partition to the present day communal
riots. It probes into the religious bigotry by examining the attitudes

of three generations of a middle-class Gujarati business family.
Hardika, the grandmother, is obsessed with her father's murder

during the partition turmoil and betrayal by a Muslim friend,
Zarine. Her son, Ramnik Gandhi, is haunted by the knowledge
that his fortunes were founded on a shop of Zarine's father
which was burnt ‘by his kins. Her daughter-in-law, Aruna, lives
by the strict code of the Hindu sarnskara and the grand—daughter,

Smita, can not allow herself a relationship with a Muslim boy.
The pulls and counterpulls of the tarnin are exposed when two
Muslim boys, Babban and Javed, seek shelter in their house on
being chased by a baying Hindu mob. Babban is a moderate

while Javed is an aggessive youth. After a night-long exchange
of judgements and retorts between the characters, tolerance
and forgetfulness emerge as the only possible solution of the

crisis. Thus, the play becomes a timely reminder of the conflicts
raging not only in India but in other parts of the world also.“
