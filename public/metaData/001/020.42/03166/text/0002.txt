ABOUT TH E P LAY
Depicting lives of everyday mortals "LOG-BAAG" reveals myriad of moods, class
distinctions and various shades of mind and attitude. A play with eight short stories
of Chekhov woven together, each individually depicting a slice of life. Yet, the
common thread that binds them together is the essential conflict between "What
should be" and "What is" and also the typical Chekhovian end that undercuts each
story at the very last moment.
The stories can be seen as seemingly transparently simple yet with great subtlety
Chekhov undercuts mammoth institutions like, bureaucracy, parenting, marriage,
medicine... Yet at the same time Chekhov goes behind social institutions and with
great sensitivity reveals glimpses of human emotions of insecurity, narnelessness,
confusion, pain...

The playwright Neil Simon has brilliantly selected the short stories such that each
one depicts the complex facets of the writer in the play. The writer's conflict at
penning down his experiences as stories, itself is an organic story in the play.
Neil Simon : Greatly acclaimed American playwright who has scripted brilliant plays
like The Good Doctor, Proposals, Second Chapters etc.
Anton Chekhov : The versatile storywriter, playwright who gave masterpieces like
Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters. The Cherry Orchard, lvanove, Seagull. Like life itself seemingly simple but carried within themselves various complexities, and therefore
his stories have immense mass appeal.
