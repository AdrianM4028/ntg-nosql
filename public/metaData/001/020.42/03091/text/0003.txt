ABOUT THE PLAY
'Ek Mamooli Aadmi' underlines those features of an urban middle class setting
which makes the yearning for real happiness an agonising experience. The play
also accentuates the contours of a system in which even biological relations are
bound to breed loneliness and family becomes fatal to individual.
lshwar Chand Awasthi, the protagonist, is to die soon and this fact makes him
realise that it was not life that he led so far. It was death, unnoticed and
unannounced. The perception of this death anirnates him and he turns to be the
source of others' happiness â€” an extraordinary asset to life and society.
