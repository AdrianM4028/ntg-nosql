a politically committed left—wing playwright, the publications and productions of whose
works were banned by the Nazis, forcing him to flee Germany and spend many years in
exile. Some of his famous works are 'Caucasian Chalk Circle', 'The Good Person of
Szechwan',The Life of Galileo', 'The Mother Courage' and 'Three Penny Opera'. Brecht
