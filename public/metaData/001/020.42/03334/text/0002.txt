Bertolt Brecht (I898 ~ I956). the famed German playwright and theatre director, has
been a major influence in contemporary drama and theatre all over the world. He was
a politically committed left-wing playwright, the publications and productions of whose
works were banned by the Nazis, forcing him to flee Germany and spend many years in
exile. Some of his famous works are 'Caucasian Chalk Circle', 'The Good Person of
Szechwan',The Life of Galileo'. 'The Mother Courage' and 'Three Penny Opera'. Brecht
is well known for his theory "Epic Theatre" which he developed in conscious opposition
to the established theatre of his time, as well as for his poems which are sensitive
documents of his times.
