Yet another milestone

in two years of dedicated service
Punjab has attained yet another distinction in energising a record number of 36,770 Tubewells

during 1978-79. The only other State to have exceeded this number is Maharashtra which has energised
48,589 tubewells. The area and population of Maharashtra are six times and four times respectively as
that of Punjab-

In the last two years the daily consumption of power has gone up by 93% and as a result

of more energy being supplied to

the Tubewells, rice

production has gone up by 76.8% in two years

between 1976 & 1978.
