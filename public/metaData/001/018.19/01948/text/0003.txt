About the ‘Play
I do believe that where there is oniy a choic
e between cowardice and violence
I would rather have lndia resort to arms
in order to defend her honour than that

she would in a cowardly manner become or remai
n a helpless witness to her own
dishonour.
-— M. K. Gandhi

A confluence of love, patriotism and sacrifice, the
play pivots around a love- triangle.
Circumstances compel Asha to wed Pitamber, a revolutionary
patriot To avenge the agony
inflicted by her betrayal, her lover Ashok makes up his mind
to do her only child to death.
However Asha’s plea for mercy and persuasion to work for
a constructive cause for the
motherland, transforms Ashok. With a vow to live for
her and her husband. he lets
Pitamber escape and takes the blame of killing Khan Bahadur
, a supporter of the British

Government, at a public meeting, on himself.
