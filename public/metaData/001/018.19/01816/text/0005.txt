SYNOPSIS
Maharathi Karna also known as Ardha Rathi is ironically called Paramrathi. His mother betrayed him, society
rejected him andthe so called upper class opressed him for their
own prestige. While Bhishma refused to accept his greatness.
Drona disregarded him for Arjuna, Krishna always tried to
shatter his will power and Draupadi denied his identity.
Duryodhna favoured him for his own interest, but his argument
towards Karna was justiﬁable which made him his true friend.
Long before the battle of Mahabharata many wars were fought.
Karna struggled and fought for his own identity, rights and ideals.
Although he died yet he was the real winner and this brings hope
for survival. There are thousands and thousands of Karnas of all
castes in our society who are deprived of their rights. Presented
in seven scenes'the play is dedicated to all those Karnas.
DIRECTOR’S NOTE

The Mahabharata composed by Ved Vyas has been
re-written and translated in various languages, number of times
by different writers. The play delves deep into the "I‘reta Yug’
to explore the ideas which are of relevance quite contemporary
to us.
