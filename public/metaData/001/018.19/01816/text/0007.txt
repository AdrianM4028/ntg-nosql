SYN0PS 1S

The tplay deals with the most critical phase of an :
individual’s li e, that is teeenage and its problems. It also tells 5
about the dreamy world around him or her and shattering of the ‘
dreams. At this articular age the individual is a confused
character because e or she is neither accepted by adults nor he
or she is a child now. The individual heart beats in a different
direction which is normally not liked by his or her elders.
Sukumar’s case is the one which is an example of such a tragedy.
Sukumar’s heart craves for doing something different fmm the
norms of the society while his parents want to set up Sukumar in
the usual society trends. That is the reason why Sukumar’s
character has been depicted with the help of two actors, one who
represents his heart and feeling while the other who represents
his physical aspects. The form in which it has been worked out
is a Simple form which includes gayki from "Nautanki", the
contemporary punches from "Tamasha Shaili" of Maharastra.
The costumes and sets have been designed in a simple manner.
DIRECTOR’S NOTE
The famous poet of Punjab, Pash has written that the
worst thing that can happen in an individual’s life)is the shatterin
of his or her dreams. Asgar Wajhat’s play "Veer Gati" deals wit

this thought in a subtle manner.
