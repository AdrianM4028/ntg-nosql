original and exciting story.

it begins and ends in Heaven, coming full circle after having travelled to Earth and focused on aspectsof village and
urban life in contemporary India. The Hero is a ten-year old Boy who hasjust died. God sends him to Earth for him to find
out who he is and to learn the ways of the Earth-people.
The children act naturally, passionately and with humour, mainly because it is their own play. They made it. it says
what the children want it to say, and in their own language of movement, mime, song and dance. it is expressionistic, as
is much of children’s play, with characters such as God, Agni, Devil, Trees, Wind, Water and Polluted Clouds. It is social,
with characters such as Zarnindar, Politician, Policeman, Drug Addict, Prostitute, Teacher, Tribal Shaman. it is epic-and
picaresque, With locales such as Heaven, A Village Well, A Slum, A School, and A Tribal Village.
The play has been created by 54 children of the 5.0.5. Children’s Village, Greenfields, Faridabad, during a one-month
Theatre Workshop conducted by Barry John and the TAG Theatre-in-Education Unit. The music and songs have been
composed and arranged by Mahendra Sharma.
