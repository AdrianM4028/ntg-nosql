CHAPTER Two

George has recently lost his wife. His brother, Leo, a man about town, throws woman after ३

woman at him, in an effort to rehabilitate him. The attempts are often hilarious, always
unsuccessful. Till, as a result of a mistakenly dialled telephone number, he encounters Jenny,
a recent divorcee. Thereby hangs the rest of ’Chapter two’, by Neil Simon.
Chapter Two is best described as a romantic comedy. But that is an inadequate description.
Chapter Two is a humorous, sensitive and compassionate account of a second involvement .

Directed by Barry John, who also plays the lead, Chapter two will be staged at Kamani
auditorium, from the 22nd to 28th of May, at 7.00 p. m.
We look forward to having you in the audience. Tickets will be available at Cottage
Industries Emporium, Janpath, and the Book Shop, Khan Market.

Yours sincerely,
