A rollicking, spirited comedy, set in the exotic, sensual world of the "Arabian Nights",
BAGHDAD KA G H U LAM is one of TAG's most successful productions, a play we are proud
to present once again.
Unfolding like one of Scheherezade's romantic fairy—tales, full of passion, adventure
and unbelievable farce, the play presents the happenings amongst a most unlikely mix of
fascinating characters, during the course of one day in Baghdad.
At the very beginning of the play, the plot bursts into chaotic life, as an engagement party
is disrupted by the appearance of a man previously promised to the same girl in marriage
but now presumed dead, killed in a duel. In fact he is dead, as we discover that it is his sister
in disguise.
And that is only the beginning.
The man who killed her brother is her lover, and she has come to Baghdad in disguise
to search for him. Unknown to either of them, Gulfam cleverly arranges and maintains his
job as servant to both of them, and, at the same time, unwittineg keeps them from finding
each other. . . until the end of the play. The antics, wit and hysteria that Gulfam instigates
meanwhile, creates a captivating tale that will positively enchant the audience.
This production directed by Barry John features Raghuvir Yadav of 'Massey Sahib' &
‘Mungeri Lal' fame, supported by a strong team of skilled performers.
The repeat shows are scheduled for the 1 6th — 23rd of November 1988. It will be staged

at the Shri Ram Center, College Road. New Delhi at 7—00 pm.
Tickets will be available at Cottage Industries, Janpath, Book Shop, Khan Market and
Modern Bazaar, Vasant Vihar.
The shows on 17, 18 & 19 November are in aid of the VOLUNTARY HEALTH
ASSOCIATION OF INDIA.

Looking forward to seeing you,
Yours sincerely
