The director has undoubtedly, gone far towards the inner world ofThakur for the play.
I hope the audience will like the play as well as feel inspired towards Ramakrishna

Sri Ramakrishna's message was unique in being expressed in action. The, message
itself was the perennial message of Hinduism. As Swami Ghanananda points out,
Hinduism is unique among the historic higher religions in holding that neither
Hinduism nor any other religion is a unique representation ofthe truth or a unique way
of salvation. In the Hindu view, each ofthe higher religions is a true vision and a right
way, and all of them alike are indispensable to mankind, because each gives a

different glimpse ofthe same truth, and each leads by a diﬁ‘erent route to the same goal
ofhuman endeavours. Each, therefore, has a special spiritual value ofits own which is
not to be found in any ofthe others.

To know this is good, but it is not enough. Religion is not just a matter for study; it is
something that has to be experienced and to be lived, and this is the ﬁeld in which Sri
Ramakrishna manifested his uniqueness. He practiced successively almost every
form of Indian religion and philosophy, and he went on to practice Islam and
Christianity as well. His religious activity and experience were, in fact,
comprehensive to a degree that had perhaps never before been attained. by any other
religious genius, in India or elsewhere. His devotion to God in the personal form ofthe
Great Mother did not prevent him from attaining the state of 'contentless
consciousness'- an absolute union with absolute spiritual reality.
