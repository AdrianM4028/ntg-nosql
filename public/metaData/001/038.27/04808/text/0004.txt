Your encouragement and support for such causes is only too well known. The world
will remember with gratitude your motivating Sri Sekhar Sen to make his now famous
presentation on Swami Vivekananda which has become so successful. I am sure that
Sri Bapi Bose's presentation on Sri Ramakrishna will also be crowned with similar
success.
With kind regards
YOurs sincerely

I saw Pratham Parth, directed by Bapi Bose and got deeply impressed. I requested him
to do a similarly impressive play on Ramkrishna Parahamsadev, which would create

an impact on audience.
Our discussion on the subject went on. I read out the Ramakrishna Leela in four

sessions. of one and half hour each. He found interest and studied Ramakrishna
literature in depth. Even, he visited the Sadhana Peeth â€” Dakshineswar Temple for
detailed research

After thorough study for two years, the script took shape for the production and I have
gone through it repeatedly.
