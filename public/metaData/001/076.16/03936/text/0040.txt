PRIYA IS A MALNOURISHED
CHILD.

Doesn't every child deserve adequate food for physical and mental development? Isn't it a

disgrace for any child to go to bed hungry? At CRY, we believe they do and it is. If you feel as
we do, join us. Help us ensure that local health ofÔ¨Åcers and nurses implement the
government-sponsored nourishment schemes for pregnant women, infants and children.
This will ensure that India's children grow up to become healthy young adults.
Partner us and permanently change children's lives by restoring their basic right to nutrition
and health.

EVERY SECOND CHILD IN INDIA IS MALNOURISHED
OR UNDERNOURISHED.

TEAM UP WITH CRY TO CHANGE THIS.
