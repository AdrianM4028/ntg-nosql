We were one day tol

dancers at work in a place called Patel Chhatravas. All of us boarders pined to be taken for
an outing and anywhere was a place good enough for us. As our bus chugged along the
dusty road I felt that the expanse of sheer space that passed us, probably too wondered

where this group of children was going in this clattering bus. We finally reached, what
seemed to be the end of the horizon, inward bound the Patel Chhatravas. As we got off the
bus we were told to hold hands with our partners, making a neat dou bl e-li ne . We entered the
building to be ushered up a spiral stairway leading to a huge square hall. We were asked to
sit cross-legged on a durri covered cement floor. The sound of the gong made us sit up
rarnrod straight. Who were these strangely clad people? Their movements seemed even
stranger. What was happening? । was unaware of the privilege l was being given in being
allowed to see the rehearsal of the yet un-performed Bhairavi, choreographed by Prabhat
Ganguli. । later on learnt that the movements were of the Mayurbhanj Chhau and that they
had been taught by none other than Krishnachandra Nayak, the legendary Mayurbhanj
Chhau dancer. (Krishnachandra Nayak made an attempt to teach me Chhau when l was in
the \/111 Standard. l proved to be a bad pupil and missed this rare chance of learning from
him.) 1, of course, learnt of his greatness only many years later, after he passed away.
My inner reactions to those strange stork-like movements rernaln etched in my mind after all
these years. What I found even stranger, was the image of this thin, wiry lady with a cigarette
snugly stuck between her index and middle fingers and the most twinkling pair of eyes one
could imagine. With her was tall handsome man whom I just could not help staring at.
“Anjana Puril Johri didi (Vishalakshi Johri, our principal, whom we all called Johri didi) is
asking for you. . . ” । heard a voice call out from nowhere in particular. । looked around nervously
trying to quickly ﬁgure out what । had done or not done. When I went to her, John‘ didi put her
arm on my shoulder and told this lady, “Here she is.” That was all. The lady and the tall
handsome man looked at me and gave me a broad smile. I was asked to return to the bus,
which by now was ready to take all of us back to the hostel.
A few days later I was again sent for. This time it was in Leela Bhanot’s little room. She was
our mess in-charge and a very kind lady. There । again saw the same pair - the lady with her
cigarette and this handsome man. An ancient black car - something like a Hillrnan - was
