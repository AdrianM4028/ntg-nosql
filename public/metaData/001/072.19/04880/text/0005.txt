Dear Sri R. P. Tatrun,

Today we are celebrating the 90th Birth
Anniversary of Late Sri Anil Kumar Mukherji.
Sri Anil Kumar Mukherji is known not only for his
contribution towardsilleatre in Bihar but also for his

being a very shaft, polite. and kind hearted man.

My association with Sri Mukherji had been for years
until his sad demise and I fully remember what a

fine gentleman he was always smiling and inspiriting
others. His Birth Anniversary celebration by way of ‘
holding Patna Theatre Festival is befiting to his
oaraoter and ambition.
To
