ANIL BABU - AS I KNEW HIM
——C HAT URB HUJ

Anil Kumar Mukherjee (Anil Babu) met me at Patna

Akashwani after his return from European

tour, He was full of praise for

Stanislavsky, the Russian giant of Stage and one of the founders of Moscow Art
Theatre, I requested Anil Babu to give a talk on Stanislavsky system of theatre over
All India Radio, and he readily agreed to do it. I received a number of letters of

appreciation from listeners, This was followed by a number of talks in regard to
Theatre including one on the Act of Directing a play,

Anil Babu once invited me to read out my latest play ‘RANVAN’ to the
assembly of his drama-desciples, It was an amazing thing for many to depict Raavan

as a hero because he has been known as an established villain. The reading of this
drama touched his heart so much that next day he came to meet me in my oﬂice at All
India Radio and expressed his desire to have it staged by the Bihar Art Theatre, He

requested me to direct the play, but as I had no time, I very politely declined,

He

himself undertook to direct the play,
Anil Babu had sympathy for the oppressed, and throughout his life he fought

for their cause.

He was not an idealist,

happens. It may be good or bad, He was not

depicted in most of his
because of this thinking,

but araealist,
a dreamer

He believed in what acually

of idealism,

This has

been

plays including ASSAM MAIL. He liked my drama RAAVAN
In

ancient,

times

Aryans were subjugating

the

NonAryans

and making them slaves, Although son of a Brahmin ascetic and himself a highly learned
person, Raavan took the oppressed and fought for them, At the time of his

fall

in

the

battleﬁeld, Raavan told Rama that he fought in Satyug and in Treta and was defeated
but he would continue his fight in future also and that his real ﬁght would be in Kaliyug
when he (Raavan) would be present in the soul of every man,
