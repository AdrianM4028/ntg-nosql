A MESSAGE FROM THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR
The Traverse is delighted to have this opportunity to bring an award
Winning production of “Great Expectations” as a part of our British
Council, London sponsored tour ofﬁve countries, which, in India, is jointly ~
presented with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.

The Traverse is a unique theatre: we exist to take risks, to try the new,
discover the future and nurture new writers and performers. As an International theatre situated in the heart
of Edinburgh, we look to develop
strong links with the people who
live, work and study in the city, whilst,

at the same time, looking to artistic
developments from all over the world.
Therefore, we take particular pleasure in this visit to India which will
enable us to experience the richness

ofyour culture while sharing something of the spirit of The Traverse
with you.
Great Expectations, which was ﬁrst

produced in 1988 by TAG Theatre
Company, exempliﬁes the aim of The
Traverse to integrate a wide range of

performance skills to create new and
innovative work. This production, which we previewed at The Traverse in
October, before embarking on this tour, is a rare collaboration between
r and
actors, dancers, musicians, composer, designer, writer, Choreographe
and
voice,
