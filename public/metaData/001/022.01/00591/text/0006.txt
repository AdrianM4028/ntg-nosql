THE PLAYWRIGH'I‘ WRI'I‘ES ABOUT HIS
EXPERIENCE IN ADAPTING
"GREAT EXPECTATIONS"
First we read the play together. We sat in a circle and took turns. If
anything struck anyone as important, we would write it on a huge roll of
paper pinned to the rehearsal room wall. The dancers chafed at the inactivity. Each day there was a dance
class: and then the actors ached. The
roll of paper got longer and longer.
Looking at it made me dizzy. Then I
had six weeks to write the script before
the company reassembled and rehearsals began in earnest.
Dickenswrites wonderful dialogue and
creates very strong dramatic scenes.
But what binds it all together is a story
of amazing complexity that can only be
told in a novel. It is impossible to
reproduce on stage. It drove me to
despair : with only days to go before the
start of rehearsal, I still could not get
the script ﬁnished. But somehow at
the last minute, I got to the end, and for

the next six weeks of rehearsals we worked at it together. Dancers and
actors create work at very different paces and in very different ways; the
script had to be endlessly changed. Learning to work together was very
intense, very difﬁcult, and very rewarding. In the end we only did it, I think,
because we were all determined, committed, and all able to trust each other.
