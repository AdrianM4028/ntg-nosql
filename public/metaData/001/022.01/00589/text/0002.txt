Way'ang Kulit
of Bali
Introduction
Wayang Kulit, shadow puppet theatre, is one of the
oldest and most revered forms of dramatic expression in

Bali. The word wayang derives from a root meaning
“shadow”. In this sense the origin of this theatre can be
seen in ancestral worship, where the puppeteer brings to
life the shades of the past and reaffirms their relevance
to the present.
Sitting crosslegged behind a framed and stretched
sheet screen, using an oil lamp suspended overhead for

illumination, the a'alang (puppeteer) recreates the
stories of old by manipulating ﬂat, articulated leather
puppets, whose intricately perforated shapes cast their
shadows on the screen. A banana tree log along the
bottom edge serves as stage, where the central pointed
handles of the puppets may be inserted when these
figures are to be stationary. Two assistants sit on either

side of the dalang, to his left is the wooden puppet

chest, against which he knocks with a gavel held
between the toes of his right foot for sound effects,

punctuating dialogue, and providing cues to the
musicians sitting at the back. Apart from a few
aficionados, most of the audience watches from the
shadow side.
Sources for his stories are two great Hindu epics, the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana, along with purely
Balinese and Javanese variations and additions: local

sources such as the Panji romances, the story of Cupak,
and Calonarang, and recently the Tantari Kamandaka.

Music
The musical accompaniment for the Balinese u'ayang
leulz't is provided by gender u rayang, a quartet of bronze
keyed ‘xylophones’ somewhat like the Western
