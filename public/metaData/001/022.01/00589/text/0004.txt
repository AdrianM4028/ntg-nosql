Meanwhile the monkey army of Sugriva, allied with
Rama, is preparing for battle. Several of the most famous

of the monkeys dance: the bird-like Sempati, the tigerlike Seraba, the goat- like Mendanala who has hair like
fire, and Drawi who has hair like thorns.

The battle begins. Great exhalations from
Kumbakarna’s nose literally blow away the monkey
hordes. 'Iheir king Sugriva continues the fight, uprooting
a giant tree one hundred times the diameter of his own
armspan. Sugriva is knocked unconscious. His general,
the white monkey Hanuman, is able to revive him while
he is being held in the immensely powerful arms of
Kumbakama. Sugriva bites Kumbakama’s nose and
escapes, Laksamana shoots an arrow that rips off all the
clothes of Kumbakama. Vibisana and Laksamana each
shoot an arrow, lopping off the arms of the giant. Two
more arrows cut off Kumbakarna’s legs. Kumbakama,
however, is still fearsome to behold, and he speaks

coarsely to Rama, with the intention of ensuring a quick
death. Rama shoots many arrows into Kumbakama’s
mouth, who still does not die.
Finally, Vibisana asks Rama to despatch his older

brother and give a noble death to the warrior. Rama
shoots the magic arrow Goa Wijaya, and Kumbakama is
dead.
