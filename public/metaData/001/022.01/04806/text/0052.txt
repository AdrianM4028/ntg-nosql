THE PLAY
Jung Ab Nahin Hogi (There Will Be No More Wars) is based on Aristophanes’ Greek
classic, Lysistrata, written in 41 1 BC. in our version, two tribes,Khaebani and Piroo/
Mach/ii, after gaining their independence through joint struggle against foreign
colonial rule, are kept in a constant state of strife and war among themselves by
chauvinistic rulers. Fed up with the regime ofwar and violence perpetrated by

men in the patriarchal social set—up, the women of both tribes ﬁnally decide to
take action and assume control of affairs.The hilarious comedy ends with some

very sobering reflections about the state ofaffairs in our subcontinent.
