THE PLAY

position of a (married) woman without her husband. Unable to accord her any
place in the society, it throws a challenge: be a virtuous woman and die before
your husband, or remain virtuous and bring your husband back to life. There is no
denying that the problem is a typically patriarchal one. However, the patriarchal
system rs also challenged by the very representation of Behula: it is she, not her
husband, who is imbued with the agency of daring to embark on a journey alone
to achieve the impossible.

Quite a few performances in Bangladesh are based on a body of texts that seek
to establish the worship of Manasa, the goddess of serpents. Commonly known
as the Padma-purag or the Manasa—marigal, these narratives in rhymed metrical
verse belong to a genre of medieval literature known as the mariga/akdbya. Two
central characters presented in these performances are Manasa, the ’illegitimate’
daughter of Siva, and Behula, wife of Laksmindar. These two characters may
well represent the Female Other deeply embedded in the Bengali patriarchal
imagination. The Female Other can be a deity or a mortal. As a deity, she is
wrathful, yet generous if propitiated. As the etymological root of her name
signiﬁes, she desires and wills that the whole world submit to her and that she
win her rightful place in heaven in the company of gods. But in order to do that,
she has to conspire against and wreak havoc on her arch enemy, the merchant—
prince and ardent devotee of Siva named Cad Saodagar. In the most vicious of
these schemes, she has Cad’s son Laksmindar killed on the night of his wedding
by snakebite. Where Manasa’s virtue is questionable, Behula’s is not. But if Manasa
can risk the existence of a single woman, Behula cannot. Ifa woman is a mortal
and her husband dies, her existence is indeterminate for she can neither claim a
place in the household of her husband’s family nor in her natal family. However
Behula does not jump on the funeral pyre of her husband Laksmindar. She sails
down a river on a raft with his body, withstands attempted molestation by hostile
men, reaches the abode of the gods, wins Siva’s favour and brings her husband
back to life. Nevertheless, when she returns home, she has to pay the price with
a test by ﬁre. Ironically, despite all these accomplishments, she cannot win her
rightful place among mortals and has to ascend to heaven with her husband.
The female presence that underpins the Padmd—purdrr has been strongly
recuperated in Behu/arBhasan. The text is based on excerpts drawn from six
Padmd—purdh texts and the performance incorporates techniques drawn from
indigenous, rural performances of the Padma-purag. By (re)presenting Behula,
a popular archetype of the Bengali woman, the performance explores a central
problem still unresolved in the collective unconscious of the Bengali people: the
