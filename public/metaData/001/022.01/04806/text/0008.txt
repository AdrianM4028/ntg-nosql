Jamia Millia lslarnia is pleased to join hands with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations
and the National School of Drama in presenting LEELA : SOUTH ASIAN WOMEN’S
THEATRE FESTIVAL.
The idea of organising thisTheatre Festival grew out ofthe deliberations and decisions of the
Conference on “Women of South Asia : Partners in Development"that was held at lamia Millia
lslarnia, New Delhi in March 2009.
Theatre is a powerful and intense medium for creating awareness about sensitive socio—
economic issues such as gender equity, the deprivations and difﬁculties faced by women from
all communities and the need to mainstream their livelihood and development. South Asian
countries from Afghanistan to Myanmar share cultural and social traditions which can help
them learn from each other’s experiences and best practices. This context gives the South Asian
Women’s Theatre Festival particular signiﬁcance and relevance.
It is our hope that the plays from across South Asia presented in this Festival will be a
combined cultural, aesthetic and learning experience for audiences in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata
and Chandigarh.
