During the reign of King Byamadad at Bayanasi, Gotama Buddha
is a mythical bird ofthe Himalayan forests, named Kainaya. His
wife Kainayi and he live on a silver mountain called Sanda. One
day the king goes hunting to the forest and sees Kainayi there. He
falls in love with her and decides to kill her husband. He shoots
Kainaya down with an arrow and tells Kainayi that if she marries
him, she would become his queen. Kainayi rejects him, saying she
would rather commit suicidelhe king departs for his kingdom.
Overwhelmed by grief at her husband’s death, Kainayi invokes the
gods. Sakka, King of the Celestial Beings, is moved by her plight. He
brings Kainaya back to life by pouring holy water on him. Kainayi
and Kainaya pay obeisance to him and leave for their abode on the
silver mountain, happy to be together again. . .
