THE PLAY
Sada/rainaya Jam/<0, based on past events in the life of
Queen Yathawdayar, describes one of the birth stories of the
Buddha. During the reign of King Byamadad at Bayanasi,
Gotama Buddha is a mythical bird of the Himalayan forests,
named Kainaya. His wife Kainayi and he live on a silver
mountain called Sanda. One day the king goes hunting
to the forest and sees Kainayi there. He falls in love with
her and decides to kill her husband. He shoots Kainaya
down with an arrow and tells Kainayi that if she marries
him, she would become his queen. Kainayi rejects him,
saying she would rather commit suicidelhe king departs
for his kingdom. Overwhelmed by grief at her husband’s
death, Kainayi invokes the gods. Sakka, King of the Celestial
Beings, is moved by her plight. He brings Kainaya back to
life by pouring holy water on him. Kainayi and Kainaya pay
obeisance to him and leave for their abode on the silver
mountain, happy to be together again. . .
