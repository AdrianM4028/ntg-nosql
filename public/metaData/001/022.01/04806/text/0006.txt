l am delighted that the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (lCCR) is organizing the first ever
South Asian Women’s Theatre Festival, in collaboration with the National School of Drama and
Jamia Millia lslarnia from March 8-l5, 2010 in New Delhi.

The South Asian Women’s Theatre Festival is a unique concept, as it focuses exclusively on
women’s issues and will bring together talented theatre groups from Afghanistan, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka. in addition to the 8 theatre groups
from South Asian countries, we are also presenting 6 theatre groups from different parts
of India who will present diverse theatre performances. I am also happy that Mini Theatre
Festivals are being organized in Kolkata and Murnbai, following the event in New Delhi, which
will combine foreign theatre troupes with local talent.
South Asia has a rich history of theatre, which has been facing challenges due to the overwhelming presence of ﬁlms and electronic media. We need to strengthen the rich heritage of
theatre in the entire South Asian region, and I am conﬁdent that this Festival will be a catalyst
in encouraging and sustaining the theatre movement across the sub—continent.
