TH E PLAY
Based on Maldivian folklore, Dhonhr'ya/a—A/ifu/hu is a richly evocative tale ofpassion,
obsession, greed, jealousy, love and lust. erat makes the play unique is the setting
ofthe story, weaving elements like fund/tho (sorcery) and other traditional aspects
ofMaldivian culture, but presented with elements from modern theatre. The journey
ofAlifulhu to ﬁnd Dhonhiyala, and the challenges they face in order to be together,
take you on a rollercoaster ride that leaves you exhausted by the imagery, tragedy and
tu rmoi l.

DIRECTOR’S NOTE
Drlrorr/riyu.ki—~Alrtu/hu is a play based on one of the most beautiful Maldivian folk stories
that l have come across, Making a play out oi this story has been a huge challenge
more so because of the high expectations anyone in the Maldives would have ot
it. Another challenge was to select and arrange the cast in such a way that it was
possible to stage the play with lust 8 actors, This production is not Just the work of one

person, but the result oi the collaborative ettoi‘ts ot a dedicated team. We hope it will
turn out to be a success.

THE GROUP
Encore Theatre Productions is made up of a group ot young persons passionately
involved in theatre. It is an amateur theatre group that set out to introduce the concept
of live theatre pertorrnance as a new form of entertainment in the Maldives, Although
the group has no qualiticatinns on paper to vouch for the quality oi their work, the
success of their last per tor mance, l loo, amply makes up for this lock.
