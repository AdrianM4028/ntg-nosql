THE PLAY
Based on Maldivian folklore, Dhonhrya/a—Alifu/hu is a richly evocative tale of
’ passion, obsession, greed,jealousy, love and lust.What makes the play unique
is the setting of the story, weaving elements like fund/tho (sorcery) and other
traditional aspects of Maldivian culture, but presented with elements from
modern theatreihe journey of Alifulhu to ﬁnd Dhonhiyala, and the challenges
they face in order to be together, take you on a rollercoaster ride that leaves you
exhausted by the imagery, tragedy and turmoil.
