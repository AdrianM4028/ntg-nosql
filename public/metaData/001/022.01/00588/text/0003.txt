Artistically, Peking Opera is perhaps

the most perfect thing of its kind existing
in our world today. Its influence is deep
in the hearts of the Chinese people, and
it is as intensely popular in this living

present as it was'centuries ago. A
knowledge of it is one beginning in the
adventure of understanding this quarter
of the world's population.
The classical Peking Opera is amazing
in that it combines so many forms which,
in the Western drama, are separated. It
is grand opera, ballet, an acrobatic

display and an historical play rolled into
one changing and exciting panorama. It

definitely sets out to be something
different from ordinary life, yet on the
other hand it remains intensely human. Its
great figures, for instance, are human —
its gods, its spirits, its generals and
emperors, even its'monks and nuns. The

fiery-old Queen of the Western Heavens,

the immortals who drink wine together,
hate and love as do the legendary and
historical characters whose exploits form

so many of the plots. Moral rather than
material values predominate; filial piety,

love of country, the fidelity of comradesin—arms find equal place with the love
stories common to all people at all times.
Naturally, the customs and thoughts are
those of the day in which the stories were
written, but some very modern
conceptions can be found tucked away

in the old tales. Today’s directors have
been very skilful in bringing these to the
ore .
Just as folk legend and familiar stories
colour so much of the drama of the West,
so in China many themes for classical
opera are ancient tales that have been

handed down until they have become
part of the peaple's thinking. Classical

opera may offer many new clues to those
who would add to their knowledge and
understanding of China and of the
Chinese people.
