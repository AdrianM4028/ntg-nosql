Director’s
Note

It was Shri KN Panikkar who introduced 5 I V 1

me to the world of Bhasa and suggested a

recreation of Bhasa in Japanese. In fact, '
before The Dream, One Night Passion was A
conceived for Bhasa Mahotsavarn, Shri

7

Panikkar himselfhad plans to produce the

original Avimarakam. (The Dream, One
Night Passion was staged at the second
International Theatre Festival of Bhasa
organized by Sopanam 11-13 November

1988 at 'I‘rivandrum. The play Will be .
staged again on 20 November at Ujjain in
the course of Kalidas Samaroh, organized.
annually by the Government ofMadhya
Pradesh.) I acknowledge my debt to Shri
Panikkar for the impetus and inspiration ३
for the production.
'Avimarakam does not lend itselfto easy
adaptation in Japanese because the plot is
intricate and fast-paced. We don’t have
है such plots in Japanese, even though Some - of the Kabuki stories are long enough. But
then these are really strings of stories '
against one episodic backdrop. L0ve
stories in Japanese, at any rate, do not
have a comparable episodic pattern.
Avimatakam attracts us for other reasons.

" The play is not only a story of requited love
but also a reserve of imaginative, evocative A

myth and lore. (Take the relationship of
the hero to the gods for instance, his trials
and ﬁnal triumph.) There are also features

of purely dramatic interest The jester, for _
instance, is cheated of his ring because he 7
is Buddhist— a splendid theatric trick

` Grafting these peculiarities of an Indian
story onto Japanese theatre is really the
raison d’etze of the play.
. -

Among the plays of Bhasa Avimaralrarn, a
melodrama, has a special tempo. The

'

dramaturgy is comparable to 16th-century
European drama, the unfolding of the story
similar to Shakespeare, Moliere or

commedia deI’arte. That is why we have
employed here a gorgeous variety of
Kabuki. Noh provides a suitable structure ३ \
for the action between men and gods.
