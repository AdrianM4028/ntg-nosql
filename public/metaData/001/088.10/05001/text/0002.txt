DIRECTOR'S NOTE
Apart from its emphasis on the humanist aspect of religion, which is
mostly ignored and forgotten, what attracts me to this play is the presence,

as one of the characters, of Nasir Kazmi, the lonely, wanderer poet of the
night. I have always loved his poetry which is a poetry of direct experience,
not of ideas. He appears as a counterpoint to the perpetrators of violence,
narrow-mindedness and intolerence, not at an ideological or intellectual
plane, but purely at an emotional and aesthetic level. This is the level which

I have now come to believe to be of deeper signiﬁcance. Interestingly, the
dialogues that belong to Nasir Kazmi in this play are his own, having been
taken from his letters and writings or from words attributed to him in the

articles written about him.

It is getting more and more difﬁcult to continue to do plays in this city.

Government policies, N. O.C's. , censorship, lack of sponsorship and above
all the non-availability of auditoriurns, all seem to combine to let theatre not

happen. If it had not been for the kindness of Dr. Scherer of the Goethe
Institut this performance would not have been possible. Even this place has
serious shortcomings as a theatre venue. But we have no option. All we can

do is to request the audience to rise above the heat, the cramped space and
the noise of trafﬁc and concentrate on the theatrical experience which the
cast wishes to share with 118131- प नं दृहर
