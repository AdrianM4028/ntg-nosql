deviated because chastity is 11 virtue expected almost exclusively from women throughout the
ages including our own. Because the ideal woman is chaste and therefore pure, because virginity
in woman is the acme of purity, because woman aware of her sexuality is dangerous to the
institution of marriage while 11 man wallowing in his sexuality is not. Looked at from this angle,
the myth begins to be amenable to feminist interpretations. We can say that it narrates the
ordeal of women 11s wives from 11 point of view that is imbued with intractable ambiguities;
it offers 11 reward to these exemplary women that is problematic, if not downright dubious,

for while it endows them with inviolable purity, it denies them adulthood, it relegates. them
' to the status of a kanyaa who is presumably eternally pure and eternally helpless and dependent;
it offers women comforts that are cold and reassurances that are riddled with disconcerting
111111 1111s.

Of course,

one could also argue that the myth suggests an effort 011 the part of the

collective Hindu guilty consciousness to expiate its numerous injustices to women. But even
in this act of explanation, it seems to be offering them 11 left-handed consolation: You are pure

no matter what because we want our women to be pure no matter what. Thus in a manner
worth of the Hindu sophistication and sophistry, this myth “an be taken as yet another example
of the ability of the Hindu male to eat his wife and have her too. Or, perhaps, I am being
too fa nci fu lly feminist.

Ahalya, my favourite among the five, lends herself to feministic speculations best of
all. Being the wife of 11 severe sage, she may have had to deny herself the most. When she
transgresses and sleeps with 11 lustier Gautama, she is curse-kicked into 11 rock by the angry
sage. She is condemend to inertness. She becomes the thing she has always been in the eyes
of her husband, an object She is deprived of her sensuousness, her sensuality, her capacity
to seduce, her vulneiability to seduction. She is robbed even of her right to atone for her sin
by feelingguilty. But I would like to imagine that111 her longperiod of rockhood, she continued
