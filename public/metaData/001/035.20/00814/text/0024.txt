a zombie— a soul in different body, the only body authorised to enter the sexual universe of
Ahalya? Are not the six gods whom Kunti summons to serve as stallions (two of them for
Madri) zombies, surrogate I’andus? Are not the five husbands of Draupadi actually surrogate
Arjunas? Is not Sugriva an imitation Vaali and is not Vibhisana an imitation Ravana?
All the sexual partners that the five virgins employ lose their dentities into those of
the husbands. You do not identify Mandodari as the wife of Vibhisana or Tara as the wife
of Sugriva. They remain, even when tied to these pretenders matrimonially, the wife of Ravana
and the wife Vaali. The five virgins are honest even when they are merry. They are faithful
to their husbands in their necrological code of loyalty. They translate in earthly and earthy
terms the time—honoured ambition of an ideal Hindu wife to join her husband in heaven. They
chalk out an alternate path of virtue, a pluralistic subroutine in a program which is traced
by a monic foot-print.

Indian texts are polysemic but that is not the whole story. There is an eye in the storm,
a point of equilibrium in the chastic dynamics of meanings and words at war with each other.
I do not mean to say that there is "hope in despair" or something equally silly: there is certainly
nothing normative about what the classical Indian mind communicates. The problem of the
livil in the Indian vision is indistinguishable from the solution of the Good. As the Is'opanisad
cryptically puts it (version 9—15), Ignorance will lead you into darkness but knowledge will
lead you into greater darkness. My own gloss on this aphorism is that while Ignorance is absence
of light, knowledge is absence of light and darkness. There is ultimately no reality. Truth is
a disposable cover on an Abyss. However this does not deny the Hesiodic cosmology - out
of the Abyss are indeed Earth, Love and Death born and the virtual reality of the fire-circle
the alata—chakra - called the cycle of life is generated.

What does this tell us about the five virgins? I think that we can find an explanation
