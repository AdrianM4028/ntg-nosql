period 3f our inception, LTO had prnduoed

three misucal plays NAI MITSEX,

IETHOK LHAMO

and ANDHER NAGRI.

.

These plays still remain among the
theatre lovers, 'oause one fxnd
finds theastructuIO, defined characters, language, sense of
drama, professionalism. Besides, LTO participated in different
‘cultural activities held under the auspices of J&K Cultural
Academy, Tourism Depptt; & Information Depptt; in the capacity
of performing arts

group.

Recently LTO

has

celeberated

World Theatre Day,97 on 27th March,97 ac Leh under the

the

chair-

manship of Mr. Thupstan Chhewang, Chief Executive Councillor,
LAHDC, which remain very successful. Our action towards the
success will depend not only
on the active participation of my

artists,

but largely

on an appreciative

public.

WHY A HINDI PLAY §
I feel it is
very necessary
to cover all the
forms
and
style of Theatre by staging
plays of different
playrights and
this time I got the Opportunity to direct the ANDHER BAGRI a

classic of Bhartendu Harishchandra."The intention is only
to
nurture and develop the phylosophy of Theatre among artists of
LTO Land as well as to introduée the various aspects of theatr—'
icalxarts among the theatre lovers through our production
process. I know , it“is hard to enact a Hindi
classic with
non hindi artists, but for all of us
it is not just a Fun,
but rather an experipnce, some days of learning and growing
in the field of Theatre and a warm feeling of
achieving something.
A learning

is not

just doing

something

or undergoing

an

alteration, but infact
it is accepting
the pattern and the
structure of the Process. We have due respect
for each othersi
.ability. The feeling of team sprit and cooperation we have achieved,
although to be in the theatre is a challegge, the more you learn
about it , the more difficult it becomes and there's ,never an
end

to

the

learning.
