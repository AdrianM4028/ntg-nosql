world.
2. Advant ‘of times has brought many changes,

but Performing Arts have retained, nee, strengthened their hold - Theatre being an all time
favourite then and now, with characters whose
delineation makes an indivi’dUal appeal:

3.

It is heartening to know that . our State is ,not -

lagging and groups like “Theatre Mitra”, “are, ,
strengthening the elTorts of Gevemment in
"
promoting and preserving the Performing Arts
and through them not only entertaining but
conveying the universal message of. love, brother. . .
hood, equality and tolerance.

4.

“Theatre Mitra” has made an apt choice; in,

staging Shanker Sheh’s play “BA-RH .KA PANI”
on Dr. BR. Ambadkar Jayahti falling on 14th of '
April, 1996 and paid the richest tribute due to '
Baba Saheb and his efforts of a casteless soc1ety.
5. I Wish “Theatre Mitra” all the best for their
efforts in promoting and preserving the cultural
heritage of our State and Society.
