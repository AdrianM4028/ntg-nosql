I am very happy to kan that some young

and talented Theatre lovers of Jammu. have
established Theatre Mitra in Jammu. Theatre
as a vehicle of creative expression is gaining
popularity in this region and the number of acco-

mplished actors and directors is also increasing.
This is proof that in Jammu the Creative Arts
are being patronised and nurtured. I hope this
trend will continue and serious Theatre dealing
with contemporary topics in modern idiom will
develop faster and enrich the cultural scene of
this State.
