about the play

Judgement andcrime are linked to different yet
deﬁnite societal pressures. Every law of the land
takes cognisance only of black and white
without recognising the ‘grey’. The play ‘Aadhi
Raat Ke Baad’, on the one hand, questions the
distinction between ‘sin’ and ‘crime’ and, on the

other, attempts to probe into the circumstances
which make a criminal.
