ABOUT TH E PLAYS
Delhi fell to the East India Company ! It remains as much vulnerable
even aﬁer ﬁfty three years of independence. Mughalon Ne Sultanat
Bakhshi Di warns of the designs of the current onslaught.
The world is full of man-eaters who are ready to eat up anyone who
goes against them. Paagal Ki Diary is a pronounced comment on the
conniving attitude of the mortals.
