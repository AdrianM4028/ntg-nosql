ABOUT TH E GROUP
"Bahroop" is a theatre group based in Delhi. It came into
existence when a group of students decided to share its
experience with the world and its reaction to the
happenings around with a larger section of the society. It
stands committed to aesthetically innovative and socially
relevant theatre. It takes up contemporary issues to
underline the contours of our time while providing the
best of entertainment. It's very first production 'Kale Kawve
Ne Kaha' (written by Mano] Mitra, adapted by Shahid

Anwar and Directed by Md. Kazim) was awarded by Delhi
Urdu Academy in 1997.

Other successful production of the Bahroop is "Kath Jogi"
(An adaptation of Mollier's Tartufl‘) under the direction of
Md. Kazim.
In its endeavours to encourage a healthy tradition in
दृ theatre, the group also invites noted directors for its
productuions. 'Madhavi' is the result of a one-month long
workshop conducted by Arvind Gaur, the most promising
director of our time.
