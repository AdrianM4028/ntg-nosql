ABOUT THE PLAY
"Madhavi is the daughter of king Yayati who is now an
Ashrarnvasi. Galav, a disciple of Rishi Vishwamitra

comes to Yayati and asks for his help in acquiring
eight hundred Ashwarnedhi horses that he must give
as his Gurudakshina. Yayati, unable to give him the
horses but eager to retain his name as "Danveer" gives

Galav his daughter. Madhavi is blessed with giving birth
to sons who're destined to become Chakravarti Rajas
and the ability to regain her verginity by performing
'Anushthan".
Having found that the king of Auodhya owned
Ashwarnedhi horese, Madhavi and Galav reach there.
A poet is: made with the Raja according to which
Madhavi will live with Raja till she gives birth to a son.

In exchange the king would give Galav two hundred
Ashwarnedhi horses and Madhavi her freedom.
They make the same poet with two more kings and
acquire 400 more horses but then Vishwarnitra buys
all the Ashwarnedhi horses in the land so that Galav
cannot get the remaining 200 horses Madhavi also
disappears.
