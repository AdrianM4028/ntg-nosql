ABOUT THE PLAY
Identiﬁed as an unalloyed comedy, the "Yeh
Bhi Us Jaisa" (Venetian Twins) is endowed generously with wit and. humor. The
play places insight into human psychology,
on the one hand, and the prevalent social
system, on the other. So far as the social
element is concerned, the play offers a very

' sharp commentary on a society in which
women are treated as second class citizens.
It is amazing to notice that the social ambi—

ence highlighted in this Italian play, way
back in l 748, hols immense relevance to this

society at the end ofthe twentieth century.
