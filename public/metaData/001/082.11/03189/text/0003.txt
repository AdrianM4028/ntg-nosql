DIRECTOR'S NOTE
This play has caught the pulse of today's competitive times.
There is bitter cut throat competition around us which makes even

daily survival difficult. Running in this rat race at top gear is really exhausting
and leads to cynical iealousy for those who seem to be ahead of us. The desperate,
futile attempts to keep up with the ongoing pace give birth to defeatist mentality
and utter despair. This despair gives rise to a'feeling of insecurity which is
clearly reflected in this play. There are some materialistic symbols of a successful person as accepted by
the world. To attain those symbols how law would you step down?
Would you let your soul be corrupted in this process?

How are you going to deal with your Sathe?
These are some questions the play asks and makes you think over.
In this sense the play speaks a lot about morality. As Salma says in this play,

”Certain things are iust not to be done, because they stick to your soul and
stain it permanently.”
The play has references, dialogues, questions, madness and boredom of the
current times. Hence it is a fresh play, a play of our generation.
