३ _.KAMBAKHTH SATH E KA KYA KARE हैं
Abhay runs on Advertising Agency, while Salrna is a lecturer of

English literature in a college. They are married to each other and living in Mumbai.
....so far so good. But Abhay has got a chronic problem. He is frustrated
by the success of 'Mr. Sathe'. Sathe is into film-making and according to Abhay
does not deserve the recognition he has acquired. Abhay keeps on competing,
comparing himself with Sathe and falling short, gets trapped into a vicious circle of
self torturing iealously.
He is cynical about Sathe's success and vents his acidic feelings whenever
he is alone with Salrna. Talking with Salrna is his only outlet. Salma tries to
pacify Abhay sometimes by love, sometimes by setting an example by her
own behavior. She even steps into a debate, confronts him, contradicts him and

tries to pull him off this slippery path. At times, she even sets her wishes
aside to understand him. Salrna who wants to live a clean and peaceful life
wants Abhay to do the same by accepting his own limitations and stop cribbing
about them. She also has her own set of problems but she gets over them
and wants Abhay to do the same.
This play is a dialogue between the two of them. It is a circular dialogue between

two tendencies, between two ways of living life. In each scene and also at the
end of the play a cycle gets completed and a new one begins.
