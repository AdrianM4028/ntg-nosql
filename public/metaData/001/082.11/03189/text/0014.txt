D | R E CTO R ’ S NOTE
The challenge of Gurcharan Das’ MIRA is to find a
theatrical form that will preserve its fragile beauty
of language...a form that evokes rather than
imposes...that allows the individual imagination to
flesh out the characters and their backgrounds.
A Visual Enactment lets the emphasis fall on the
words without the distracting detail of costumes,
properties, decor.

To enrich the fabric of the play, the director and

actors working together with artist and musicians
have attempted to create a new form: a fusion between human voice, painting and music. Actress 1 is
not Mira. She speaks the playwright's words which

interact with the projected images and the live
music to evoke a Mira that is individual yet universal...that comes to life in the space between the
stage and the audience. This for me is the true Mira.
