AUTH O R ' S NOTE
MIRA is not a historical play, but a play set in historical time. The assumption is that MIRA could
have taken place in any country at any time. This is
a twentieth century look at the phenomenon of
sainthood, an attempt to understand something
which continues to be a very important aspect of

the Indian world view.
MIRA is the story of the metamorphosis of a beauti—
ful young princess into a saint, a madwoman or a
witch, depending on your point of view. It is also the
story of her husband who has to suffer the tragedy
of this transformation—the price he has to pay, so
to speak, so she can become a saint.
The play is set in early sixteenth century Mewar, a
princely state in Rajasthan, much burdened by a
sense of its own destiny and full of the blood and
ritual of wars and warriors and an emotionally
charged atmosphere of faith and formality. When
the play opens the Rana is preparing to lead the
Rajput confederacy against Bab’u r, the great Moghul.

Historians consider Mira important in helping to
turn people away from ritualistic religion to a
personal love relationship with god. At one level,
then, the conflict between the Rana and Mira is a
conflict between Kali and Krishna, between the path
of ritual and the path of love (bhakti), between
formality and spontaneity.
