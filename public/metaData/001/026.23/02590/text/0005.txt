Director’s Note

Fifteen J MC students were the participants of a workshop in performance skills which

took place prior to the production ; the present female cast is drawn from them.

The male

cast joined the group only at the time of casting. They were chosen from a group of five that

auditioned.

I did not realize it was such a problem to attract men to a wornen’s college.

The women’s involvement in the workshop and their commitment to the challenges
inherent in the production of the play have been commendable, eSpecially in view of
obstacles like classes, examinations, famin concerns and DTC buses.
In the play Annie Sullivan, the teacher, writes about her relationship with Helen, the
student :

The greatest problem । have is how to discipline her
without breaking her spirit......The more I think,
the more certain I am that obedience is the gateway
through which knowledge enters the mind of the child ....... ..

It is a problem that still confronts teachers. And parents. 0f healthy and whole children
as well as handicapped. One hundred years later the same sentiments seem to hold true for
most teachers and parents ; in fact, through the whole gamut of systems of innumerable
educational phiIOSOphies, from primitive rites and religious indoctrination to modern institutionalized education "for all", a similar basic concept of obedience.

Later, towards the end of the play, Annie says :
....... . . to do nothing but obey is no gift:
obedience without understanding is a
blindness too ....... ..
Is that a change of heart ?
