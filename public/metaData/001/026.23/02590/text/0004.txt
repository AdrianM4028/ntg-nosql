Those who perform on the stage and those immediately concerned with production and
direction will, । trust,’ receive merited acclaim from the critics. There are others who may
be forgotten e.g, those concerned with the thankless chores that support the smooth
running of rehearsals and those whose function it is to ensure that enough money is forthcoming for those necessary “extras” for cast and helpers.

While these others, I would

venture to wager, work the harder, and shoulder the more responsiblilty they also benefit the
more from their experience with economics, social living, and perhaps a measure of politics.

The faculty immediately involved with English dramatics in J MC have been readily
available to inspire and to guide and to support, yet it naturally fell to the lot of the student

president of the drarnatics society to accept for herself these thankless chores. With a spirit
of confidence and commitment that is at once traditional and unique Afshaan Shafi of the
111 year English Honours class has accepted and played her role.

And so it is with a

modest sense of pride that । look forward to see THE MIRACLE WORKER.
