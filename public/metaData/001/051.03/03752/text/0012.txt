The sports teacher is taken into confidence. The children are going

to stage a novel kind of protest, he is told. The worried parents
come looking for the children. They are astonished to find the
children in the belligerent formation. The sprots teacher tries to
mediate on behalf of the children. He tries to persuade the parents
by explaining that the communal cracks will further widen if the
children are separated. He observes that this will end up in a
permanent schism in the social body. The parents do not acquiesce
and try to force the children to stop their protest. The children sing
a song of protest, holding the elders responsible for the riots and

violence. Why should children suffer for the deeds of the elders,
they demand to know. Parents do not have an answer. Though
they do not agree to change their decision, they promise to
reconsider. Children jump with joy. Though not a total victory, at
least a small battle is won. A concluding song pays homage to the
killed Auto Riksha driver and the life continues.
