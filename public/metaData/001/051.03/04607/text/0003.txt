The story of the play reveals the fear and struggle for existance in
modern times through interrelation and conflict between trees, human

beings and human mades. The lessening of human feelings towards
living things and the dream of co-existance of plants and machines
the play projects both the ideas equally and progresses to point out
who actually is responsible for the birth of this struggle. Are you
prepared to share the responsibility?

EXPERIENCES
Many things surround us as we walk through our lives. We notice, we
recognize and cherish those we can directly relate with. Other bear no
significance to us. But some day, under some situation when we happen
to see those things from a different perspective, we realise that they
are no less important and they also deserve a thought and a glance
During the process of the play ‘Tulsi.. Tulsi' we got a chance to relate
with few such things. That air, those plants and these toys and with
them the sweet memories of the childhood all came to life. Everything
was so new, so real! Touching the air, meeting the flowers and their
families and peeping behind the still faces of the toys were some of
the most memorable moments.
We were thrilled! Now all that we wish is to share it all with you.
