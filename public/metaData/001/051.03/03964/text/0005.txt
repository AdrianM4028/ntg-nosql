Whenever I have been asked to write a director's
note, I ask myself, 'Why i am doing theatre for a
young audience?’
Over the years I have had many answers but the
bottornline remains the same.
Because I enjoy doing theatre for them.
I strongly feel that Theatre for the Young
audience has a lot ofpotential that we haven't yet
explored to it's fullest. We have just begun. . . .
In my opinion, to take the "Theatre for the Young'
further, we need to understand our age old
perceptions about young audiences, accept them

as individuals not as children, give them the right
to ask questions, make mistakes and ﬁnd their

own answers.
I also feel that doing theatre for young adults is so

gratifying! !
They are uncorrupt, spontaneous,
imaginative and express their feelings
honestly as they watch the play. Ifthey like it
they laugh (mostly in the places where you
least expect!) and if they don't, they start
talking to each other and you don't know
what do!
The next thing therefore, is to improvise
your thought process to get their attention.
For an actor this becomes an enjoyable part
to play with the children during the entire
play. Where else will you ﬁnd this MAS'I‘I
except in the Theatrefor the Young? !
