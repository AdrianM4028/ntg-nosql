About the nlav
The play 'Head ya Thil' tells the story of a
nine-year—old boy, Pintu, who thinks that his
parents love him only when he fulﬁlls their
desires and do not accept him as he is. He
thinks that if he runs away from home, then
they will miss him and may be then .............
In his thought two characters, Lucky and
Badhali, appear before him. They possess a
special power and can turn a situation into a
lucky or an unlucky one by saying head or
tail.
On hearing Pintu's sad tale, the two
characters in his dream try to help him by
granting him a wish. Pintu first wishes for his
parent's unconditional love but Lucky
refused saying that he could only make
wishful thinking came true but could not

change reality.
Pintu then wished for a Princess. He thought
that by marrying her he could impress his
parents and earn their love.
The Princess appears but Pintu fails to impress
her. Since she is aware of his motive, she
corners him by asking a lot of questions until
Pintu confesses.
Through the journey of his fantasy Pintu
realizes, the value of being honest with
himself, learns to accept others as they are and
in the process starts accepting hirnselfas he is.
He comes into terms with himself.
The beauty ofthis play is that it never ventures
into a linear story telling form; on the contrary,
it explores various dimensions: the past
intermingles with the present... reality and
illusion overlap... and a complex web is
woven through Pintu's imagination.
