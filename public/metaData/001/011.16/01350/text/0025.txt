KALO RASTI (The ï¬‚ark Slum)
22 , 1 2 . 95

How for can one go in imagining the lowest possible level of subsistence ?
Beyond that limit, there lies the KALO BASTI where some sullen, dismantled men are
compelled to live in a horrifying state of insufficiency.

Poverty holds them in its toils.

In their insipid life they go without the minimum qu0ta of square meals, the basic
requirements of life.

Even the sun fails to extend its rays to their narrow lanes, refuses

to entire through their windows to offer a little warmth to their cold beds, where a
dying child cries a prayer for a palmful of sunshine.

And the darkness persists.

When they are awfully short of things, men/women have a SUperfluity of
infighting, mistrust, cymicisrn and envy.

The urge to unite weakens under the pressure

of deprivation that strips them of their humanity.

Gods turn away front them.

Goddess of wealth is seduced by the rich, and leaves for sweeter climes.

The

They pray to

the sun for warmth and the sun, scorching and cruel, irnpreguates the recesses of the
slum only to give birth to dead children. who are set to the pyre by their mothers.
Deaths accumulate somewhere else.
The child struggles and assertes his right to live.
