MUAVZE /मु अग व जे

ABOUT T H E P LAY
Muavze is a satire on the present day values of our Society. it is a comment on our
contemporary “inverted value“ system. The playwrite has chosen various characters
with whom we have an encounter every day directly or indirectly.
The play uses the filter of humour to portray the diverse reactions to an impending riot,
without actually enacting it. However, the humour far from hiding the goriness of the
riots, highlights it by bringing forth the machinations of the minds which are one way
or the other affected by it.
Muavze means compensation Compensation for what? For the lives that are lost, for the
wounds that are obivious, but not for the values and the tendrness that is lost forever.
Communal riot may have been a social calamity once but not anymore. All that seperates people from people are tangible rungs of the ladder or personal growth.
