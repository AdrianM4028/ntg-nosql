ABOUT THE PLAY
In today's crowded world, where life itself has become a rat-race, man is tendering
towards forgetting himself Gradually he is moving further away from himself and closer

to a vacuum, which wil l leave him at a dead end in the time to come.
The evening's production is an effort to present this tragedy of middle-class life
through the eye of irony.
