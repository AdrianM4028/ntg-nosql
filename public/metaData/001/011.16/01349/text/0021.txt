RAJ DARPAN/Ua दर्पण
ABOUT THE PLAY
Who are we, the Indians of today? What are the elements composing our psyche ?
Where have we come from ? Where are we going ?

These are some of the questions we address in ’Raj Darpan' Our mirror of the British
Raj seeks to understand and deal with the myriad political and social complexities
which led to the imposition of a totally alien culture on us, repercussions of which are
bound up in our present existence.

'Rai Darpan' consists of three elements : snippets of Ra] nostalgia; Extracts of Indian
nationalist plays and songs which were banned by the British, and the cornerstone of
the play-the Dramatic Performances Act of 1876, which was invoked by the British and
is still in force today; We also deal with the ideas of ’black’ and, white, and the play
ends with a look at thc cultural and economic re-colonisation that is sweeping over
India (and the rest of the ’Third World’) packaged and beribboned as ’globalisation'.

'Raj Darpan’ was first performed in New Delhi in May '94 as the final student production of the NSD class of ‘94,

३ The class was instrumental

in the evolution of the production, contributing greatly

through its suggestions, improvisations writing and exercises.
