tion. Few portions I read
out to Dr. Kambar, he did

feel comfortable with the
structure of the language
from the sound of it. Later
when Bhanuji heard the
translation alongwith the
actors, all apeared happy
including Bhanuji. The Di—
rector, Bhanu was howev-

er slightly worried, naturally, for I had exaggerated
narrative language of
Bhagwat and Mayawati in
the beginning of the play.
Bhanu had, in fact, want-‘

insistant from the beginning that as far possible,
he would not like to use
the Yakshagana or South

ed that the play must be—
gin with the great sense of
somberness ofjapan' ‘Noh’
play and sould move further with the dignity of that
theatrical convention. My
understanding of the starting of the play was different but it was too late and
it was mutually agreed
between me and the Director that the Director will
change the initial portions
of the play to suite his di-

Indian theatrical conven-

rectorial requirements and

tions to communicate the

the Hindi version of the ini—
tial portions as prepared by
me will also be published
when it comes through.

Kambar is an eminent playwright of our times. This
play ‘Siri Samplge’ is wellknown for its theme which
deals with the duality and
ambiguity of mind and
body and is also quite famous in Karnataka and
takes its source from the
ﬂoklore which was also the
basis of Girish Karnad's
play ‘Nagmandal'.
I read the play in English translation which
touched me deeply. The
structure of the play, the
situations,

the

cones-

ciousness torne by the du—
alities and the intense ex—
perience made it difﬁcult

how should I transfer this

structure of the playwright
into Hindi. The Director,
Bhanu Bharti, also was

play in Hindi and, natural~
ly, since this play was specially translated for his

production, I tried to take
theatrical exaggerated conventions, old Hindi,

of

northern region and other
eminent popular folk styles
of my own Mithila-region
and the combination of all
that filtered in my transla-

More over, one did not

have time at that point to
translate two versions together so it was left to
Bhanu in whose sensisbility
one had the trust.
We both discussed and
decided the new title of the

play for the Hindi version
as we thought that the heroine of the play ‘Siri Sarnple’ does not suit to be the
title of the play. According
to our understanding, she
is not the subject of the play
but it is something which
will be better reﬂected in
the new Hindi title ‘Aks—
Tamasha’ (which literally
means playing of the images). Keeping the Hindi
spectators in view, we also
changed the name of heroine ‘Siri Sampige ‘to’ ‘Rani
Saampa’ ‘Kalinganag’ has
been often referred as
‘Nagaraj’ or ‘Kaliyanag’.
Other references have been
kept intact because the
structure of the folk tale
does not create any
hinderance in getting it accepted. During the rehearsals, the Director, the team,

the Music Director and others have improvised, added or subtrated, for which
they are to be credited. Still
because of the language,
the original story Or the
poetry of the playwright
and intensity of experiences, if derailed here and

there (which usually happens in translation) I must
solely feel humble. I am
grateful to the playwright
and

the

Director,

who

thought me worthy of translating it.
