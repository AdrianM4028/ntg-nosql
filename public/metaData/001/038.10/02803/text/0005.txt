54s a part of our 25th anniversary celeBrations, we are happy to have Begun a

numBer of Little ﬁlctors CluBs, located in diﬁ‘erent neighBourhoods of {Delhi ‘Ihese
have Been started Because we at Kuchika Believe that there is increasingly a need

for a new kind of relationship Between the arts and young people. It is an
overstatedfact that the child’s exposure to creativity through actual participation

in dance, drama, music, art etc. forms an essential part of his/her developmental
process. However in an urBan centre such as 'Delhi, the availaBility of adequate
facilities to make this possiBle, are few and far Between. ﬂs a result over a
period of time, young people tend to look on the arts as entertainment, as seeing
the artist as Being a different kind of individual. ’Zhere is an acute need at the

present, therefore, to change this kind of thinking, especially in the field of theatre
where, Because the activity is a group one dealing with tangiBle living proBlems,
the growth process of the individual is not secondary, But really primary.
Instead of merely relying on young people to come and Be entertained in the
theatre, we need to involve them in the entire process of play making. ’Each of

our Little ,‘Zlctors CluBs has Been designed to meet this speciﬁc ijective. rIhey
provide a 35 session program run By experts covering an extensive range of drama

activities. Movement, acting and improvisation, music and elocution, creative

writing and expression, art Based activities and mask making........... all these will
help the child gain in self conﬁdence and self expression, improve group- Based
interaction and put the child in touch with his/her own creativity. ‘Ihrough this
process we will Be preparing the child to eventually Be involved in the entire
production process, including Backstage and onstage skills. The size of each group
will Be limited, so that each child gets individual attention.
Our first group Began in NovemBer 96 in 9.7011, and three more groups located
in Noida (’7’ 9.17011 have Been added since then. 'Ihis evening ’s performance is

the first puBlic performance for most of our 57 memBers.
from OctoBer-DecemBer 97 the Little ﬁctors CluB is proud to Be linked with the
'British Council and the National Museum, to present a production Based on the
ex‘hiBition, "Ihe £nduring Image '.
