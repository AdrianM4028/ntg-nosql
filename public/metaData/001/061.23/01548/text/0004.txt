THE JANPATH KISS
"The Janpath Kiss" is Ranjit Kapoor’s stage version of Akhileshwar Jha’s novel of
the same name. This fantasy underlines the paradox of the hollowness of moral values
in our contemporary society, and it was this paradox which inspired and compelled the
Director to write the stage version.

In the play, Sadanan d Mishra hails from an orthodox family of a remote Village. He
finds himself totally surrounded by the hollow circumstances of the village and its
backward society and by virtue ofhis intelligence obtains degree in Engineering. Under
the pressures and protection of a local politician, Sadanand comes to Delhi and gets a
Government job as an engineer. At Janpath, Delhi, Sadanand forcibly kisses a girl,
Meera Chandani, for which he is caught and prosecuted. The politician meets Sadanand
and persuades him not to accept the crime and that he will prove to the court that
what—ever happened was an action in a state of temporary insanity. Sadanand does not
speak a word in this context and states true facts in the court. He is sentenced to two
year’s simple imprisonment. Meanwhile, his parents, wife and other family members
including the politician cut off their relationship with Sadanand. The only person who
comes to jail to meet Sadanand is the girl Meera Chandani, who now recognises his
righteousness and truthfulness. Both of them fall in love with each other.
Centred in fantasy of a man forcibly kissing a girl on Janpath in broad day light,
the plot brings into play the rot eating into the vital s of the contemporary Indian society.
Each character forced to react to the central fantasy of the kissing on Janpath, explores
his or her ownself, and the audience gets an expose ofthe Indian socio-cultural Society.

A play full of comedy and humour.
