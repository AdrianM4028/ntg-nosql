COURT MARTIAL
A court martial is convened for offence against Civil and Military Law.
Jawan Ramchander is being tried under section 69 of Military Act and section 302
of Indian Penal Code for the murder of an ofﬁcer.
The Military Court scene brings out with vividness the typical atmosphere of such
a court.

The whole trial becomes a metaphor, where each one of the audience has a feeling
of being tried within his self.
