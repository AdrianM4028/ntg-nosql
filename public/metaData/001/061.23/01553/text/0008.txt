MATI GARI

माजी गाडी
(Based on Bidesia Folk Form)

Bidesia—the folk theatre form is no longer strange to the Indian
stage. After nation wide presentation of‘Amali’ (writer—Hrishikesh
Sulabh/Directo-r—Satish Anand) on the modern stage, this form’s
unbelievable communicability, the ability of its theatrical nuances
to reconstruct and give profound descriptions of life and the
immense possibilities that it holds for the development of
contemporary theatre consciousness attracted the Indian theatre
people, the critics and the wide audience. Mati Gari is the second in
the series of presentation of Bidesia theatrical form.
Mati Gari is based on Shudrak’s Sanskrit Play, ‘Mrichkatikam’.
Shudrak was the only writer of his times who wrote on the then
prevelent administration. Bhasa’s ‘Daridram Charudattam’ is a
twin piece.

The songs of ‘Mati Gari’ are based on the folk tunes popular in
Bihar’s folk lif'e. Tunes prevelent in songs like ‘Jhoomar’ ‘Khilona’
‘Pahpat’. ‘Birha’ etc. and theatre forms like ‘Jat Jatin’ ‘Domkach’,
‘Pakhavaj dance’ etc. ‘Musical forms of ‘Kavni’ folk tales and tunes
of various ritual songs have been used. Somewhere these tunes are
in their original form and somewhere with appropriate changes
according to the demands of theatrical presentation.

Presentation: 'KALASANGAM, PA'I‘NA
