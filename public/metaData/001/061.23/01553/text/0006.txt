AMAR B E EJ

अमर ३ बीज
(Based on a Bheel legend)
Dharia (One with an edge) Bheel goes to a lush jungle and selects a
huge banian tree to cut. As he strikes the tree for the first time he
gets fresh and sweet water from it. Second time it is milk which
comes out. But, the third time it is blood.
'

Very soon there is ocean of blood. The entire earth gets drowned in
it and ferocious demons start breeding in the blood.
Dharia realises the folly of his greed and calls the mother nature to
forgive him. The angry mother has gone off to sleep in the
mountains. With great difficulty, Dharia is able to wake her up. She
tells Dharia that he has inflicted a terrible wound and it won’t heel
till he brings the immortal seed (AMAR BEEJ) from the under world
( PA’I‘AL) .

Under world is ruled by the ferocious serpent god Vasuki. Dharia
gets burnet by the poisonous fumes of the serpent god.

Finally mother goddess is compassionate again. She appears in a
lotus ﬂower and manages to get the immortal seed herself. Dharia
and the earth come to life again.
