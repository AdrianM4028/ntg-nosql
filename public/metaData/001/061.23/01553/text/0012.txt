पंचतंत्र - ३ ३ 3 `
(Based on Animal Fable)

The animal fable, one of the oldest forms of secular literature, was
developed by Indian genius into a highly artistic genre: the
intricately woven chain-fable, imbued with deep practical wisdom
entertainingly presented. The PANCHA’I‘AN’I‘RA is unique
amongst these, having perhaps "a more interesting history than any
in World-literature". Hertel has recorded over two hundred versions
in more than ﬁfty languages spread over a region extending from
Java to Iceland. Although, as the name implies, it propounds ﬁve
‘techniques’ of statecraft or political expediency, it is essentially a

story-book, and its stories are woven into the fabric of the Indian
people’s consciousness.
The ballet is based on the second ofthe ﬁve books that comprise the
work : ‘The Winning of Friends’, Combining the features of ballet,
opera and drama, it draws richly from the store of phantasy, and
the inventiveness characteristic of Indian folk lif'e.
