HARICHANNAR KI LADAI

हरि चन्नर कीं लडाई
(Na uta nk i style)

THE PRODUCTION
Nautanki is a traditional folk-theatre form of Northern India with
emphasis on music and narration rather than acting. In this respect
the two styles of this age-old art, namely Kanpuri and Hathrasi
Nautankis, lack variety 3 s opposed to the various South Indian Folk
Theatre forms,. which are a combination of acting, dancing and
music. In Kanpuri Nautanki the lack of Ras tradition of Hathrasi
style has been supplemented by the introduction of some glamorous
elements from Parsi theatre.
The basic theme of our play has been inspired from Sarveshwar
Dayal Saxena’s play "Larai"-a thought provoking story which
throws doubts on the old ideals and values as compared to the
situations in the world to day. The central character of our play,
Master Haria is a renowned professional Nautanki artiste, who
while portraying Raja Harishchandra on stage night after night gets
so hypnotized with the character, that one day he vows before the

Goddess to be truthful and honest like the character he portrays in
his real life also. From this point onwards Master Haria’s problems
really start and provide food for thought and make us wonder if such
a life is possible in today’s world.
It has been our endeavour to preserve the spirit of Nautanki but at
the same time trim out the exaggeration of mellodrama where
necessary. The language of the play is a mixture ofAvadhi, Bundeli
and Brij as spoken in small towns. The entire play is presented as
a combination of Kanpuri and Hathrasi styles, with a few extracts
from Ustad Inderman’s and Pundit Natha Ram Gaur’s Nautanki
"Satya Harishchandra". At certain places use has also been made of
poetry of Dushyant Kumar and Dhoomil.
