MAHAB H OJ

महा भोज
Mahabhoj, a contemporary classic, is a play which needs no
introduction to theatre audiences. This production is merely an
attempt to communicate the playwright’s vision with economy,
simplicity and in a manner that it can reach out to the very people
who are the central characters in the play.
