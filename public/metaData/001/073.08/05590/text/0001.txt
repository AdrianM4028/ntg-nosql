pHouoIBI LANGUN
(MANIFESTATIUNS or THE RICE—SPIRIT MOTHER)
15; PHAYEQEBCHAELEE
A.v 21-1u.- .

The play is a modern Ferti
lity ritual.
The performers
enact a worship belonging
to the pan~animistic tradi
t
i
o
n
o
f
ancient Meiteis.
A drum is consecrated as a
symbol of the
cosmic womb, beeuether of
Fertility and growth.
The lore of
the goddess Phouoibi, the
rice~spirit mother, is ena
cted.
According to the lore, the_
goddess was learnt to have
manifested herself from tim
e to time in different area
s of
Moitei land, to previde prosp
erity and abundance to those
who were true and worthy of
her.
But the Mciteis, because
of tensions and cares ushere
d in by their mundane obsess
ions,
and because of their lack
of true knowledge, forget
the
divine revelation and lost
her in the process,
This truth
from the beliefs and philos
ophy of ancient Meiteis is b
rought
into focus in this ritual p
lay.
F
r
o
m
t
h
e
c
o
s
mic womb, the
goddess Phoucibi is born
unto the peasant communi
ty of
Chakpa Phayeng, an origin
al constituent of the Me
itoi tribe.
The goddess in her earthly m
anifestation fell in love wi
th
Pun
gdinghanba,

a young drum maker

and hero of the community
.

But the jealous neighbours
and clan members destroyed
their
lous.
During a serious famine, t
h
e
h
e
r
e
w
a
s destined to
prepare a drum and the gi
rl was to weave the deity
's clothes.
But the community in the f
orm of evil spirits falsel
y
implicated the lovers and
brought tragedy into their
lives.
This play is thus an exp
loration into the kind
of animistic
world, where gods, men an
d animals interwacted equ
ally in
an intense relationship,
and where death itself was
an
indu
cement to further growt
h.

The

performers act

out these
fantasies and beliefs, pro
viding a psychological ins
ight into
a world which were our o
wn, but which we had for
gotten for
quiet some time.

This play was prepared as
p
a
r
t
o
f
a project for the
Ferd Foundation, New
Delhi.
