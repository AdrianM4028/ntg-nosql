greatness of form, external artistic life and a value system deeply rooted in tradition which also generated

a conservative, feudal temper, the young society ushered in by the forces of the modern economy are
throwing up human beings incapable of facing the new dynamics, thereby making them look inward,

become parasitic in outlook habituated to the dependency syndrome, iosing self-esteem and sense of
upward challenge in life. Others more volatile, amoral dashers make hay, using the best opportunities that
the pro-establishment values of life offer and reach high levels of success and recognition, which is
contradictory to the patterns of life indigenous to the soil. Reputations of artistic excellence and recognition in a value system distanced to the vibrancy of the soil precede the exposure to the inner reality of the
personality and character of the modem purveyor which throw up further contradictions on judgement of
what is good and beautiful or what is bad in the social world of the Meitei. In traditional Meitei values, the
character of the artiste should accompany the beauty of his product - both are ontologically related. But in
Manipur as of today, the beauty of art has been divorced from the beauty of the very character who

generate that art, which is contradiction. Modern Manipuri Theatre does not attempt to resolve this contradiction.

I have always maintained that in theatre, music ana’ dance
have to shed theirgrammar anol take over a new identity.
