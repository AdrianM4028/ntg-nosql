underestimating another creative exercise which we can take up by reshaping the text according to our
own sense of performance. Whereas a playwright in general, especially in Manipuri theatre has the least
information of the intricacies of the signifying process of theatre and the changing language of performance. Moreover in a play we find many things suppressed, excluded or relegated to the margins. In fact, a
text is not an imposition. We encounter with it and create our own performance by taking liberty of it.

From Ethno-text to Ethno-play or Ethno-performance text
We may begin with an issue or a social drama and go deep into a field-based ethnographic study of
the dramatis personae involved in the issue and the issue itself as we did in the case of the IMA KEI’I‘HEL
(1987). Secondly, we may take up a written play and study the contextual implications of the text. After
this we may take up a ﬁeld-based ethnographic study according to the demands of the text. Then we may
try to shape up an ethno-play text or ethno-performance text by taking liberty of the original play—text.
This is what we did in the case of SAK-KHANGKHIDRABA LANMI (1990) and CHINGNUNGI
'I‘HAWAI (1991). This process helps us in freeing the text from gross idealisation and in establishing a
bond between the text and the reality it repreSents.
The actors have to do field study among different people of the group. They have to be with the
people interacting most of the time in different situations. In a way they have to try to be an ‘insider’ in the
group not an ‘outsider’. They will try to experience their social, political, economic and the deep lying

text. The director will then jointly work with his team in a creative workshop style of process to turn the
ethno—text into ethno-play text or ethno-performance text.
