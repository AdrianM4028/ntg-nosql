certain beneﬁcial results, in that a viewer in Bombay has some knowledge of a director from Irnphal, or
one in Madras has occasional access to a production fromChandigarh, even though they may not comprehend what is spoken on stage. Yet the central administration -- prime movers of the credo of unity in
diversity -- has done precious little for such indirectly integrationist theatre, in terms of concrete support.
Unlike the governments of most developed countries which subsidize full—time “art” theatre to varying
degrees, India has yet to enunciate a systematic policy of ﬁnancing theatre, and probably never will, now
that the economy has begun a continental drift toward the free market. Some believe this is as it should be,
for ofﬁcial funds come with strings attached, and also encourage laxity in creativity. Some say theatre
should fend for itself, in competition with everything else. But this path favours the ﬂourishing of popular
entertainment a la Broadway or the West End. Moreover, in a scenario where most serious Indian theatre
workers can never devote their full energy to their ﬁrst love, having to depend on other occupations for
their monthly salary, the competition for time becomes schizophrenic, against their own jobs. Government subsidy is probably more desirable, as the lesser evil. Alternatively, directors have to go begging for
corporate aid, a humiliating process. In fact, one of our biggest and frequent ironies occurs when a leftwing group agrees to perform under the sponsorship of, say, a multinational cigarette company (which of
course functions capitalistically). It recalls Augusto Boal using Ford Foundation Money to travel around

disseminating his “Theatre of the Oppressed”. Besides, as we all know, most mercantile patrons support
only those events that guarantee promotional mileage for themselves, which translates into big-name
spectacle once again. The politics of such deals ensures that not only genuine folk theatre and small-group
theatre, but such socially important developments as the “Third Theatre” and its cousins, all continue to
exrst on the fringe, inadequately represented on the cultural stage and even in educated discourse.

Neither government nor society in independent India has given theatre the status of a truly signiﬁcant activity. In the age of technology, the arts in general have suffered, but theatre in particular has
remained peripheral to the new lifestyle. Through the sheer weight of its popularity and that of its relatives (TV and video), ﬁlm has established itself as a career option; music and dance have inherited re-

spectability from their Indian classical forebears since these are still practised and taught' the ﬁne arts
form the tnost commercially viable artistic profession, now that paintings and sculptures are con
sidered
excellent investments; and literature has traditionally received social approval as intellect
ually elevatin
Theatre, in contrast, has either been frowned upon as slightly indecorous or, at best
passed as ossiblge
after-office hours hobby. Compared to the burgeoning university courses in cinema
studies thealire edu-

cation in India has ﬂoundered -- although the art form is much older than cinema an
d indeed roduces
much of the personnel who go on to become stars in the movie industry. Both

must take theatre seriously, starting at the basic level by introducing it in school
and college curriciielzi,
Visionary as always, Tagore did precisely this at his institution in
Santiniketan' he also advised us “
make the practice of drama and of the histrionic arts compulsory for all children ”
