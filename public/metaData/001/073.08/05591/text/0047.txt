This is heartening to know that the Aryan Theatre, one of the pioneer theatre groups of
the state is organising its Diamond Iubilee Celebrations from September 23, 1995 to December 31, 1996 and a Souvenir will be brought out to mark the great occasion.

The Aryan Theatre, as one among the three leading theatre groups of the State has been
taking an active role in keeping the Folk and Traditional Artforms alive from its inception
and hope this will continue to explorefurther avenues with new experimentations to hold
the banner of our unique cultural heritage ﬂying high.

_ Wish the venture a grand success.
