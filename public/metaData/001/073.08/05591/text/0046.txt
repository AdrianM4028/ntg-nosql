I am glad to learn that the Aryan Theatre, lmphal is celebrating its Diamond
jubilee from 23rd September to 3lst December, I 996 and a Souvenir is also
being released to highlight the function.
The Aryan Theatre, being one of the pioneer cultural centres, has its superb
contribution to the Manipuri society and the seminar on Meitei - Pangal festival
will help develop the sense of mutual existence with the spirit of oneness.

I wish the celebration and publication of Souvenir a grand success.
