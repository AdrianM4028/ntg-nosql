mean the process of evolving a play-text or performance-text with the help of the ethnographic data and
experience gathered from the pre-production fieldwork. Ethno-dramaturgy avoids the writing of a play by
a playwright through an individualized creative process with a mental construct of the entire performance
in his imagination. This aims at the writing of a play-text or construction of a performance-text witl. the
help of the ethnographic data and the experience through a workshop style of creative process with the
performers who are at the same time field—workers. The director will function as a central figure of the
working system.

Encountering Written-text
We have a continuous habit of taking written play as an imposition and the theatre—makers ﬁnd it

very difficult to be free from the constraints it perpetuates. This is perhaps because of the relentless
dominance of textuality and the author in the literate mind of the makers of theatre. Once words are
grounded in written form in a space its performative aspects are tyrannically locked in the form of cornrnitment.

On the other hand performance effects many constraints in the literary text. For example, the playwright has to be well-equipped with the technicalities of the stage presentation because he is not writing

poetry, novel or a short story. He is writing a play with all the performative aspects in his imaginative
construct. Because a play is basically meant for stage representation where primacy of performance over-

rides the litc1-:!ur So in the. tre word is not all and all as it is taken by the traditional and text-centred
literary critics. i' ३ actor and his physical immediacy, his presence in the performance area in relation to
other agents 1i

'३. d, props, light etc. very often speak where written words fail to speak.
