jubilee Celebration and a Souvenir is also being brought out on this

Drama is the mirror of the Society. Through the medium of
entertainment, Drama revives and rejuvenates the rich cultural
and artistic heritage of our people and society. In this direction,
Aryan Theatre has been rendering a great service by recognizing
and encouraging gifted writers andperforming artistes. I wish all
success to the Aryan Theatre in this noble task.
