lt's not just about
relationships
between people.
It's more.

It's about shedding
a silent tear when a tree
comes crashing down.
And planting one
the next day.

It's about fighting
to save the rainforest,
the cheetah the planet

It's about carrying on.
even if you are

a solitary voice.

It's all about an attitude.
your state-of-mind.

About wearing your
heart on your sleeve.
