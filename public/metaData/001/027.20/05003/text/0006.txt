TAG'S FORTHCOMING PRODUCTION :

INDIAN I N K
by
TOM STO PPARD
The play is set in two periods: 1930 (In lndia) and mid- 19805 (in England and
India). Flora Crewe, a young poet travelling in India in 1930, has her portrait
painted by a local artist, Nirad Das. More than 50 years later, the artist’s son
visits Flora’s sister in London, while her would be biographer is following a
cold trial in lndia.

The alternation of place and period in Tom Stoppard’s new play makes for a
rich and moving exploration of intimate lives set against one of the great
shifts of history - the emergence of the Indian subcontinent from the grip of
the Empire.
