'Since they are modern Characters
.....I have drawn my people as split
and vacillating, a mixture of the old

and the new....My souls

(or characterd

are agglomerations of past and present
cultures, scraps from books and news—
papers,

fragments

of humanity,

torn

shreds of once-fine clothing that has
become rags, in just the way that a
human soul is patched together.....l
have avoided the symmetrical, mathematically constructed dialogue of the
type favoured in France, and have
allowed their minds to work irregular—
ly, as people's do in real life ......

'I have suggested many possible
motivations for Miss Julie's unhappy
fate. The passionate character of heri
mother, the upbringing misguidedly
inflicted upon her by her father, her
own character ...... Also, more immediately, the festive atmosphere of Mid—
summer Night: her father's absence:
her menstruation: her association with
animals; the intoxicating effect of
the dance: the midsummer twilight: the

powerful aphrodisiac influence of the
flowers: and, finally, the chance that
drove these two people together into

a private room — plus of course the
passion of the sexually inflamed
man. . o . .
