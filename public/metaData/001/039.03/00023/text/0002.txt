in MISS JULIE

only a springboard iinto deeper
waters as Julie is the mistress
and Jean the servant.

Julie could not accept her
bitch to have as mate a mongrel.
She orders Jean to play with her,
to kiss her

foot,her hand,

to go

in the park, on the lake , to
take beer with her,
And all
lthese, late in the night when
”Sleepinees goes to one's head
and makes one rash"
The play is set in a Mauri—

context.
