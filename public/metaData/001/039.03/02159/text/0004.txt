Director’s Note

A week before our first preview, I
still do not know how the production will find its own feet onstage
and its life in the minds of our
audiences. Its final shape and the
journey of its narrative are not not
yet settled. But I do know that, for
me, the work has been informed by
many talents that I could have
found nowhere else and from
which I have learnt a great deal
about Shakespeare and theatre’s
inheritance and resources.
First of all, the actors, people with
very varied backgrounds and
experience; I have tried to help
them to use their individual
strengths so that Shakespeare’s text
can be realized with its interactions
sharpened and its characters present
in distinct and varied form.

Then the National School of
Drama, itself, as my work—base for
more than two months: behind
What is seen on stage is an encounter with a great text that has been
widely and generously shared, I
hope very much that this will be
evident in the quality of this show.
For me, the best of the work and

the most distinguishing marks of
this production have been what I
have been given.
