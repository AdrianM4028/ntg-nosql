theatre in later ages - the twentieth
century especially — these writers were
interested in more than argument and
analysis. Their audiences loved what
they called “shows” and “actions” as
well as “high astounding” words and
“ravishing” poetry, and the new
writers of Shakespeare’s time were
ready to please both appetites.
Another, less commonly recognised,
part of Shakespeare’s perennial and
wide-ranging appeal is the scope he
gave his actors for improvisation. In
some late twentieth-century productions of his plays, every detail seems
planned beforehand and is carried out
with well-drilled precision. In his day
this would have been impossible
because the acting companies had huge
repertories (almost thirty plays a
season is one instance we know about)
and little time for rehearsal. For
Shakespeare, these conditions seem to
have been a stimulus not a hindrance.
A visit to present-day actors in rehearsal will quickly show how his
playscripts are capable of many different interpretations, different moods,
tempi, emphases, visual realisation. It
will also show how actors thrive by
testing various ways of speaking a
single line and what pleasure is cornmunicated between them as they do
so. Something of all this remains - the
freshness of discovery and the opportunity to share it - in almost every
production. REcognising this opportunity for ‘play’, for invention, and reinvention, is to see more of

Shakespeare’s enduring attraction for
theatre artists and audiences. Yes, of

course, Shakespeare must have been a
genius, but his long-lasting success is in
part due to the theatre for which he
wrote. Even his sensitivity and wisdom
must owe something to the stimulus of
writing for this collaborative medium
at one of its most popular, ambitions,
and adventurous times.
