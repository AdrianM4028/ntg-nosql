DIRECTOR’S NOTE
Gorky’s Summerfolk takes as its theme the
middle-class custom in pre-revolutionary Russia of leaving the city to spend the summer in
a rented villa in the country. The summer
guests are professionals — lawyers, doctors,
engineers, writers - who meet at the residence
of Bassov and somewhat desultorily go about
the day, eavesdropping, quarrelling, fallling in '
\ love. A Chekhovian world of sorts, but with

positive characters like Maria Lovovna and
.‘Dovyetochiye who recognize the sickness of
the summer guests and persuade two of them
to leave. The ones left behind are either too
frightened or too complacent to risk a decision. They pour their wine and wait.
To image the idleness and gossip that charac
terizes the

middle—class, we

have all the

characters on stage almost through the entire
duration of the play. We hope in this way to
portray their inability to escape from each
other as also the absolute necessity of doing
so, if they are to survive courageously and
‘
gracefully.
