Sishu Silpayan staged its ﬁrst production “KHILONO

KA DESH” last year on 29th April, 1974 and it was applau- \
ded by one and all. Various cultural organizations then
sponsored the show for their members.
This year also, the second production ‘CHAKRAVUHA’
has met with roaring success.

We now plan to hold a week-long drama competition
in December amongst the various schools in Calcutta and

we hope that the institutions will co-operate and assist us in

this project.

The drama should be one to one and a half

hours duration and we would appreciate 1f you W1ll contact
us for furthe1 details inthis matter.
