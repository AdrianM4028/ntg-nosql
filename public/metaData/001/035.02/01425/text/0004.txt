Ayyasami passes judgement with the help of a chalk circle: a circle is drawn in the middle of the
court--room and the child is made to stand in the centre of the circle. Both the claimants are
asked to take hold of the hand of the child on either side and pull it towards herself and prove
who is stronger.

The governors wife prepares to pull the child to her side using all her might. while Gurumma lets
go. fearing physical harm and pain to the child.
Ayyasami decides that only the person who has concern for the child can be the true mother and
awards the child to Guruvamma.
