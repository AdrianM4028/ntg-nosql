The Play
IVANOV, Chekhov’s first serious full-length effort,

written in 1887, came to grief when it was
produced at a private theatre. It was considered

”rnerely a rough draft for an excellent play".
lvanov, scored a success later when it was repeated
at the St. Petersburg lrnperial Theatre .
IVANOV is an unpleasant anatomy of a Russian
Ham/et who marries a frail Jewess. Her wealthy
family disowns her and she sucurnbs to tuberculosis.
Highly intelligent, over- imaginative, restless, but
incapable of decisive action, lvanov cannot bear
spending his evenings at home with his wife Anna,

During the reharsa/

who is dying of tuberculosis. He neglects her and
falls in love with a friends’s daughter, Sasha. His
wife finds them together and infuriates him with her
iustified but venomous iealousy to such a degree that

he callously betrays the fact that she is dying.
A year later, after her death, he is about to marry

the girl when an interfering family doctor Luvov
threatens to denounce him for his brutality to his first
wife. Having suffered many pangs of conscience
before that, and being stung by the doctors threats,
lvanov shoots himself.
