wants to lead a good and wholesome life and that bereft of such a
commission with matters of the spirit, and a result of relying excessively on
his cleverness and intellect; Man would cause his own downfall. I would
end my performance on this philosophical note.
Amongst the many roles that brought me fame in the realm of Yakshagana,
that of Dushtabuddhi is the most important. I have derived much pleasure
in performing this story of conflict between intellect and emotion, between
the head and the heart. The public has appreciated my portrayal of
Dushtabuddhi. I hope it also appreciates the fact that I am no longer a
Dushtabuddhi I have cast off the Vesha, the persona of that character!
