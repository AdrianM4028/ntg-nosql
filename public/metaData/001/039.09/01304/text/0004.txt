Director’s Note
’Chandr'ahasa’ is a straightforward single moral story that belongs to the Bhagavatha tradition. The stories of Dhruva
Kumar, Markandaya and Prahalad also are part of the same series.
In this stories child consciousness stands juxtaposed against the cruel dernoanic tendencies. On the one hand are the
orphaned destitules who stand like lonesome figures; whileon the other hand are the wicked worldlywise who are
powerful and impertinent. In this world of black and white characters is set a confrontation which despite a prupose is
unwanted.
Harinyakashipu attacks Prahalad and Queen Suruchi is enviour of Dhruva Kumar. Markandaya is confronted by
Yamaraj himself and in the story of chandrahasa, true to his name Dushetebuddhi emerges in order to spoil an

orphan’s future.

The implied meaning is that ethical principles are far more impressive than the worldly powers and ths stands proven
even today when Ms. Aung San ’Suukyi’ in Burma has emerged as a symbol of courage against tyranny. According to
her—”It is not power that corrupts but fear”. This brings across to us the undying faith that Humanity nurtures in
itself. It is this faith that further gets converted into a miracle. Ordinary things happen for the extra-ordinary and viceversa is equally true.
Such stories are presented very powerfully in our folklore because here the conﬂict is not operative on a phychological
plane but instead, assumes the form of suggestive gestures in order to reveal the quantities of a character.

In ’Chandmhasa’ it is further clarified that the wordly and intellectual well—being is infact diseased somewhere as
against the healthy simplicity and innocence of an orphan. Many ﬂat and yet meaningful conventions in our folk
tradition come handy while performing such qualitative actions.
