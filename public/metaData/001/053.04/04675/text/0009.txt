as a positive heroine , but also as a heedlessly destructive force confronting a
civilization that is of value in spite of its blindness and rigidity. The Middle
ages must die, but the epoch has its dignity and beauty yet not necessarily
sticking to those periodic beautiful sets and costume, I have made my
characters move in and out of a skeleton construction of Joan’s journey, free
of time and chronology.
Many of the speeches in the play are ﬁne and barbed with
thought and understanding, so to maintain the originality of the play
comfortably spoken Hindi and English has been used. The echnique being
the one not usual in historical plays. As it is it’s a naive insistence on the fact
that this is a representation, not a living story.
I have disregarded mere pedantry in the presentation of history
on the stage, pointing out the relevance of Joan’s murder to the world of
today. By not following the concept of christianity strictly, but focusing on
nationalism, as it is tends to break the audience’s illusion of watching a
medieval play.
