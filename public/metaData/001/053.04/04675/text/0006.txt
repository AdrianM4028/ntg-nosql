What makes Joan’s career so miraculous and ironically, what
causes her tragic death, is, according to Shaw, her superiority to others as
military general and as a statesman. She understands the weakness of the
French methods of warfare and has far better suggestions to offer. This is
how she impresses Robert de Baudricourt in Scene I and Dunois in Scene
111. Again, in Scene V, when Dunois seeks to dissuade her from attacking
Paris, she criticizes his counsel of despair by pointing out the absurdity of
his “war game”. Joan’s genius in warfare is matched with her farsighted
statesmanship. Her crowning of the Dauphin is a political masterstroke
which rallies the French patriotic forces under one duly anointed king. So
also does her concept of one nation as against the myriad divisions of the
country under feudal lordHonstitute and advance over the contemporary
political structure. Her ideal, going even beyond nationalism to
intemationalism, is peaceful coexistence among various nations under God.
The tragic irony of Joan’s life is that her very genius causes her
downfall and death. She being an original mind, seeks to reconstruct the
political, military, legal, social and religious institutions of society—a
mission of whose full implications she is largely unconscious.
A confrontation between the mighty forces of societal institution
and the hero’s personality which can be resolved only by his absolute
surrender or death faced with the dilemma of choosing between his

treatment of historical patterns does not take an audience in one direction
only. There is a tension between opposing ways of understanding history, a
tension that compels an audience to join the play in exploring the dialectical
conﬂicts.
