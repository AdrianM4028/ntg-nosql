DIRECTOR’S NOTE
Here is a voice suppressed within everyone that wants to ﬂow out, what are the
reasons which force them to hold back. Our dreams pull us away from our dear
ones why is it that inspite of all that we don’t ﬁnd happiness.
_ So, now do we look at ourselves to realize who we really, are?

DREAMS’ have always attracted me,when I read ‘ .AR'I‘H DOSH’, I could not
detach myself even for a movement from martha’s dreams and her wishes. For a

girl to stay alone in this world is to give birth to problems. She cann’t ﬁght the
need to ﬁnd a men’s love and be with him.

We often run away from life. We immediately discard those that we dislike

without thinking that we will have to face truth one day. It is easy to end our

lives but very difﬁcult to face it.
