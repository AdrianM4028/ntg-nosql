The reason sexuality should be confessed is to be found in the Christian
view of it. It was not, as it is today, seen as a strong, obvious force, but as
something treacherous, something only to be found by careful introspection.
Making sexuality something sinful did not make it disappear. The doctrines
' on sexuality postulated several "unnatural" sexual behaviors. In the 16th
century, the focus was on regulating the sexuality of the married couple,
ignoring other forms of sexual relations, but now other groups were

identiﬁed: the sexuality of children, criminals, mentally ill and gays. "The
perverse" became a group, instead of an attribute. Sexuality became to be
seen as the core of some peoples' identity. Homosexual relations had been
seen as a sin that could be committed from time to time, but now a group of
"homosexuals emerged.

bearer. The concept "hysteria" was invented and seen because of sexuai
problems.
