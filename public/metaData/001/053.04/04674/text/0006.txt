His initial literary efforts were in the Swedish language, but in the fifties, he
turned” increasingly to the . medium of film, producing ,a number of
experimental and documentary films. His first literary work in German,
Abschied von den Eltern ( Farewell to the Parents, 1959), followed the

death of his father and mother. Weiss now concentrated on writing (in
German) and in 1963 began working on the script for Marat/Sade (set in a
lunatic asylum).
In retrospect, it is to possible to identify Marat/Sade not just as‘ an artistic
turning point for Weiss, but also his decisive turn toward political material in
his work. The sixties saw Weiss moving increasingly to the left. Weiss
personally attended the hearings in Frankfurt aimed at uncovering Nazi
crimes at Auschwitz and then reworked the material into his play Die
Ermittlung (The Investigation). The experimental texts ‘ the shadow of the
body of the coachman’ and ‘the conversation of the three wayfarers’ remain '
inﬂuential , works, while the breakthrough autobiographical novels,
‘leavetaking’ and ‘vanishingpoint’, impresse a larger audience.

In 1965 he issued his " 10 working points for an, artist in a divided world," in
