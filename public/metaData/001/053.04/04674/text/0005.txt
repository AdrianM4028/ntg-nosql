… eter Weiss was born near Berlin on November 8,

1916. His father was of Austrian-Hungarian-Jewish descent and owned and

ran a textile factory. His mother was an actress who worked with, amongst
others, renowned Austrian .theatre director Max Reinhardt. Peter Weiss'

schooling in Berlin was interrupted by the Nazi take-over and in 1934 the
family emigrated ﬁrst to England and then in' 1939 to Sweden. Sweden was
to remain Weiss' home for the rest of his life.
'

Throughout his career Weiss sought out and immersed himself in literary
and artistic circlesp. He recalls hearing the newly produced Brecht-Weill

pieces The Threepenny Opera and The Rise and Fall of the City of
Mahagonny in 1930. But his own youthful interests led him towards painting
and the ﬁne arts. Against the wishes of his parents he concentrated his
energies on painting and organised his ﬁrst exhibition in London in 1936. He
gave out the last of his personal income for the rent of the cellar roomS‘ for
the exhibition as well as leaﬂets advertising the event. He records that,

lacking seats, he sat on_ the floor with a friend during the exhibition to which
no one came.
Weiss’ professed artistic mentors were the surrealists—André Bret
on,
Salvador Dali and Max Ernst—although there is no indication at that po
int
that he shared any of the political leanings, for example, of Breton. Lik
e the

leading surrealists he undertook. a serious study of psychoanalysis
and
cultivated a friendship with the German romanticist writer Her
mann Hesse
for whose books he provided illustrations.

In a letter to his long-time friend Hesse in 1961 Weiss de
scribed the conﬂict
