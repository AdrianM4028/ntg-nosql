PEELI DUWANNI is an X'Ray Photocopy of the
society we live in. 'I-EELI DUWANNI' a two
anna coin in vogue during fifties and sixties,
uncovers the ills and evils of our society.

Hyprocricy - black lead under the Golden uppaus,
Blind faith - the strongest weaknes: of fatal istic
Indian society, Red Tapism 8: corruption eating
up the vital s of the social physique and above all
disparity between the rich and poor, besides the
exploitation of the latter by former - are the
salient features of the play. Ghost scene and
Bazar scene are lively enough to raise peals of

laughter.

Note

PEELI DUWANNI got the literary award from Government
of India in 1974. To be a literary piece is one thing and to
bring it on stage is altogether something different like
Charles Dickens perhaps the author created a multitude of
characters unmindful of the limitations of the stage. Besides
the script wa उ divided into four acts of small duration and
from stage point of view giving three breaks in a play are
next to impossible. Thus the play has been duly edited into
the present form. The other problem is that the author has
relied very heavily on long speeches. Although they go down
well while reading the play, enactment makes the other
characters who are not speaking at that time, quite static.
