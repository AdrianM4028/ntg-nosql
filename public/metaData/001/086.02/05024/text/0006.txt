D I R ECTO R’8 NOTE
The present play ’Bagiya Bancha Ram Ki’ is a wonderful
documentation of the ills that were prevelent in the feudal.
social pattern in the days past.
The play draws a distinct line between the greed of feudal
rich and the misery of the helpless working class . The feudal
pattern of past is no doubt is dead but people with feudalistic
ternprarnent shown in present play are still alive who are
corrupting the young mind.

Bancha Ram, the Central Character in the play is an old
peasant emotioually attached to his loneancestoral possession, a ’Bagiya’. Though, he has grown old but his love for his
’Bagiya’ and his belief in the integrity of Man and labour are
still active and alive.
'
’Chhakodi’ represent the class of traditional feudal landlords, who were always out exploiting the rniserables fails in
hooking Banchha Ram in grabbing his possession ’the
Bagiya’. ’ Chhakodi ’ could not free himself from the lust of
money and power evenafter his death and assumes the
bearings of a ghost. He continues goadings Naukodi, his son,
to fulfil his unachieved ambition even if he is to take the very
life out of Bancha Ram .
l would like to express my grateful thanks to Sh. Yashpal
Sharma and Sh. Anoop (Michu) for offering selfless help.
