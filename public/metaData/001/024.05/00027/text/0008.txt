sleeping in their bed - room. The children,
hear the noise and get hold of the intruders. At the point of their guns they
make the fairies give them the three
wishes. As the children are unkind and
selﬁsh they miss the chance to get [tappiness out of wishing. You will see how they
suffer and f'eel sorry,

The Blessings of Rain

The children dance merrily, all of a
sudden rains come and everyone is miserable and takes cover. No one can venture
out to play. The children wish that the
rains must stop, and there should be no
rains for a year. In consequence there is
draught. Everyone wants rains to come
back. The earth is ﬂooded again with
rains, and everyone is happy.
