Roopkatha——-A Decade in National Drama
Movement
ASHIM KUMAR MUKHERJEE
General Secretary Roopkatha
It was in 1979, exactly a decade ago when a group of young and dedicated
theatre activists formed a group ‘Roopkatha’ for the development of theatre and its
allied ﬁelds, with Sri Parimal Datta as its founder Chairman~Director.

The founder

members accepted this unique form of Art not merely as a means for providing
entertainment but as an instrument for activating progressive line of thinking. In
fact the words of Great Theatre thinker Bertolt Brecht ‘I came to the cities in a
time of disorder when hunger ruled, I came among men in a time of uprising and I

revolted’ With them, always hunts us.

In ten years of its purposeful existence, Roopkatha literally bulldozed its way
towards Success.
