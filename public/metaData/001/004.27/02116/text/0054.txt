and hungry as he is, he decides to dig one basketful of earth and earn something
to eat. But his physical weakness does not permit him to complete the! iob. He
almost faints in front of Malanchi, who is there to inspect the excavation work.
Malanchi recognises Madhav and puts off Sepoy’s garb to the latter’s pleasant

surpriSe. The King, the Wazir and all the people of the land celebrate the
reunion of Madhav and Malanchi.
THE PRODUCTION
In this production the director has not followed the beaten track of reviving the
ritualiStic folk theatre forms. Instead he has combined the modern dramaturgy‘ with
the traditional elements like mime, puppet, dance and music.

The songs set to tune by

Dinendra Chowdhury, music composed by Debashis Dasgupta, lighting designed by
Tapas Sen and Suresh Dutta’s craft-work fabricating the demon, the birds, the trees,
the horse, the boat out of indigenous material—everything has gone into the making of

this spectacular production. It is spectacular but simple, in consistence with the style
of the narrative and theme of the play. Spoken language used in the play is a dialect
of the East Bengal variety, but the theatre language innovated by the director to tell
this particular story is so strong that the Spoken words do not Stand in the way of understanding or enjoying the play.
