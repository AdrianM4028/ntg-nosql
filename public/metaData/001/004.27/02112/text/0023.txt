PRESENTS

PANCHATANTRA
The animal fable, one of the oldest forms of secular literature, was developed by Indian

genius into a highly artistic genre: the intricately woven chain-fable, imbuded with deep
practical wisdom entertainingly presented. The PANCHATANTRA is unique amongst these,
having perhaps ‘a more interesting history than any in world-literature.’ Hertel has ecorded
over two hundred versions in more than ﬁfty languages spread over a region extending from
Java to Iceland. Althongh, as the name implies, it pr‘opounds ﬁve ‘techniques’ of statecraft

political expediency, it is essentially a story-book, and its stories are woven into the fabric of
the Indian people’s consciousness.

The ballet is based on the second of the ﬁve books that comprise the work: "The
Winning ofFriends’. Combining the features of ballet, opera and drama, it draws richly
from the store ofFantasy, and the inventiveness characteristic of Indian folk life.
