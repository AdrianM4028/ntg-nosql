Dr. Ram Kumar Verma
Father of Hindi one act play
—Shayantani Datta

Like the bright red sproutings on a dry cotton tree, works of Dr. Ram Kumar Verma
illuminated the arena of Hindi literature. Though Dr. Verma came towards the end of
‘Chayavad Yug’ yet his works esentially reﬂect the qualities of Chayavadi poets.

At a time when Hindi theatre was virtually vaccant, Dr. Verma approached towards
the procenium like a monarch and was aptly crowned the ‘F'ather of Hlndi one act play.’
It is true, that other writers like Prasad, had contributed Ekanki to Hindi literature before

him, yet Dr. Verma’s plays had the very essence of naturality, sublimity and romanticism.
His plays were above all capable of being produced on stage with case.

His treasury includes

ekanki collections like, ‘Reshmi tie’ 'Charumitra’, ‘Char aitihasik ekanki’, ‘Kaumudi Mahotsav’
etc.

He also has long plays to his credit including ‘Raj Rani Sita (1947).

His works

mainly deal with social issues, historical episodes and tragedies. He has dealt with certain
historical episodes with present social relevence that offer a reader a larger spectrum of
Hindi literature. Plays by Dr. Verma were widely for the ﬁrst time produced on stage, and
the Monarch himself dlrected the plays. An exellent conﬂuence of languages is found in his
work. He freely used English to express himself which makes his creations richer by another

hue.

These works reﬂect his personal philosophy.

As he himself admits basic principles

embedded in him during childhood and teachings of Gandhi inﬂuenced his way of thinking

and the direction for the ﬂow of his pen.
Besides ekankis Dr. Verma has imnortal Hindi poetries to his credit like, ‘Eklavya’,
‘Uttarayan’, ‘Chitralekha’, ‘Chandrakiran’, etc.
Roopkatha pays its heartiest tributes to this great maestro and feels obliged to dedicate

the Fifth Rashtriya Natya Mela to his memory.
