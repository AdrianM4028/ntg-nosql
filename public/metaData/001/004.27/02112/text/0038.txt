Director’8 Note

The play is about the disintegration of a middle-clases family and the conﬂict between

man and woman.
it in 1970.

It has continued to allure and fascinate me since the time I ﬁrst produced

as the subject matter.

Within these main strands are woven many patterns and a Chiaros-

curo of contemporary life.
