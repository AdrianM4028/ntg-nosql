A L AKAN AN DA R DU T R AKA NVA
A tree that spreads out its branches and casts shadows beneath—Alak
ananda may
well be likened to that.

Shuva and Manashi—two ﬂowers of two different plants—Alakananda fondly hopes to weave a wreath with those and delight. Rajaninath, her husband,

crippled as he is, is more of an impediment than a help to her project. Devahuti, a neighbour disgusted of noise-pollution is already polluted otherwise. Badal, Alaka’s brother, a
victim of impulses, his son Partha, a prudent young lecturer and Lala, a street boy—they also

standby, Jugantar Shanna, a peculiar friend of the family, calmly conveys to Alaka the
news of the tumultuous world outside.

All these seem to create for Alaka a world where

noise and tumult reign supreme.

Blessed be the moment—Alaka gets a glimpse of the rays to the rising sun, she hears
the chatting of birds and begins to feel that the gloom within the four walls is not to stay—

the light and the music outside are a harbinger of a new world. Alakananda gets the
inspiration she really needed in her declining age and moment of despair to begin
a new.
