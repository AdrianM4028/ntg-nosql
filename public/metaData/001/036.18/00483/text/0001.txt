these characters, bringing out their hitherto unexplcrei complexities
and
giving t he:n new life and substance. Thefplay also raises some questions
about the position and role of women per orrers in contemporary Indian

of this

experiment,

it 1s planned to have a discussion,
after each show, for a i‘eedback from the au dience and to carry on the iialogue
on these issues.
