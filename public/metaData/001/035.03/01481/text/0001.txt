to

8th

November

November 5 is observed as Theatre Day in Maharashtra.
As part of its efforts to promote cultural understanding among
the people of various States, the Centre chose this day to ’

organise a Marathi Theatre festival in the capital with a view
to providing non-Marathi audience an opportunity to know
the developments on Marathi stage. This is the ﬁfth such
festival being organised by the Centre.

Encouraged by the interest shown by the Delhi audience
in the project and the response it evoked during the past ﬁve
years, the Centre has decided to make this a permanent feature
of its activities.

This year, the Centre is presenting one Hindi play
कस्तुरी मृग (adaptation of a Marathi play by P. L. Deshpande)
and three other Marathi plays. The Hindi play is produced

by Natya Bharati of Indore.
