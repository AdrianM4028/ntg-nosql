The theme of the play ‘KASTOORI MRIGA’ is woven
around a very simple yet often ignored truth that “One should
be one self". When some one egged on by notions of exaggerated self importance or some misconception about one’s
capacities chooses to be what one is really not, one makes
oneself miserable. The Acharyaji in the play represents this
type while Kakaji and Dr. Sateesh Pandey portray the normal,
intelligent peeple. The clashes, hilarious as they prove, lead
ultimately to the chastening confession by Acharyaji, which
is the crux of the play. Like the musk (Kastoori Mriga) deer,
men do not know that they have the fulﬁllment in their own
self and therefore, keep searching for it elsewhere.
The three Marathi plays are (l) TU VEDA KUMBHAR
(2) J WALET UBHI MEE and (3) S UTEE.
