The family waits for his return but only gets the news
that he has succumed to the cholera epidemic on his way to
Kashi. The family members lament the misfortune of the
girl. In the name of tradition they try to induce her to perform
“Sutee”.

The girl is, however, not convinced.

She refuses to

accept irresponsible Narayan as her husband and, though
refuses to go “Sutee”, jumps into the river to end her life in
her own way and not in the traditional way.

She is saved by an English military ofﬁcer of the East
India Company’s army which had got their permanent camp in
Poona. He tries to covince her about the true meaning of
human life and assumes the role of her protector. Here
developes between them a very delicate tie of love which both
of them are vaguely conscious of. The soldier has to go out
now on a war against dacoits. He presents her a revolver
before parting. Her father comes in search of her and tries
to pursuade her to go with him to avoid scandal. But she
refuses to come back to the society which has thrown her out
and is dominated by fake conventions and traditions. Meanwhile, the news comes that the military ofﬁcer is killed in one
of the battles with the dacoits. The intensely emotional girl
then decides that if at all she has to observe the tradition of
going “Sutee”, why not do it far a man—though a foreigner—
who has given meaning to her life, than for a man who has
discarded her even after lawful marriage.

All the three plays are directed by Prof. Bhalba Kelkar.
