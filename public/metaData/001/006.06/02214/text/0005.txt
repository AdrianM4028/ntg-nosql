Whose tragedy it is ? Antigone’s ? Creon’s ? Probably it is of both. It is a conﬂict
between the devotion of a virgin martyr and a King’s love of law. Who wins ? Let us
leave it for you to judge.
A word about the Chorus. The Chorus in the play is a vestige of religious
rites. The Chorus speaks the thoughts of the ideal spectator. Aristotle’s remark
that “the Chorus should be regarded as one of the Characters” is rather more
acceptable. That is why the Chorus in this production has been reduced to a single

vorce.
Two thousand four hundred and nine years after its ﬁrst production in
we venture to recreate again the subtle and human conﬂict involved. With all
and earnestness we present this evening ANTIGONE, a problem play, a great
by Sophocles that has stood the test of centuries.
