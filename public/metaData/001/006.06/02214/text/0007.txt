The ‘Chorus’ was the other important and essential element in his drama. It
consisted of a body actors, whose business it was to report what happened of the stage,

and to make such moral comments from time to time as would deepen the desired effect.
Its more important function, however, was to send the audience away with a streng-

thened conviction of the might of the Gods.

Like Oedipus, the present drama Antigone, is one of his ﬁnest tragedies; rathar
more tender, subtle, appealings and problematic. The purely human note is dominant
for the ﬁrst time in this tragedy. In Antigone, the claims of piety and natural affection
are seemingly over-borne by the exaggerated assertion of State authority in person of
the ruler, but in the end it is the ruler who succumbes. The virgin martyr is vindicated.
Antigone knows that she has done her duty. This is the glory—the glory of man; the
tragedy of man is that ‘his greatness should never be perfect’. Antigone has her sure
and certain hope; f'allacious it may be, but she has it, “and to have been great of soul

is everything”.
