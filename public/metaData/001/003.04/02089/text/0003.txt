peace in the third world countries.
The two characters, viz. Common Man and Special Man
appear as Sutradhars. They open as well as wind up the
play, covering 5 thousand years' old history of human
society, and introducing and interpreting the story of the
play,;each in his own way. The play is Common Man's
interpretation of history with characters donning mixed (old
and new) costumes and suggestive make-up.
The monarch sees Adam (Common Man) lying unconscious under a tree. On the suggestion of the slave, he
takes the man to his palace and makes him King for one day,
Being conscious of his position and authority, Adam announces decrees and measures to eradicate poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, corruption and economic depen-

dence on foreign aid and loans.

The decrees infuriate his

advisors who overthrow

through

him

a

coup-de-tat.

Agents of a foreign power, but disguised as advisers, they

compel him to drink the Sharbat which makes him unconscious. Adam is taken to a place near his house. Next
day the King holds a Special Court, presided over by
himself.
Adam is accused of being disruptor of peace and harmony,
rnutineer and exponent of truth and justice.
Finally, his wife appears on the scene with a broom symbolising the masses and sweeps the tyrants and usurpers

to the dust-bin of history.
Three couplets recited by Adam in different situations are
from a ghazal by Faiz Ahmed Faiz.
