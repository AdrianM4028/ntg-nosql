Agra is an adventure in culture. Its citizens are art thirsty
and very responsive. Their genuine oppreciation is evident in their
mass participation in every cuttural event.
Not only is there appreciation but talent too. The past ten
months specially have been ample witness to both these rare gifts
of its citizens every cultural event from “Tansen Sangeet Summelar.‘
to Sharadotsav” has been a success beyond expectation.

The production of “Hamlet” by Indian people’s Theatre
Association is a very encouraging step. Its a very courageous endeaw
our.

Local talent will come into its own.

I sincerely wish it all success and pray it will be the begining in
a great series.
