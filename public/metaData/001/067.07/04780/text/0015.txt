PRARTHNA

This production was "Sponsored by the Sangeet Natak Akademi for
their "Rabindra Natyotsav" in May 1987”. Prarthna is based on Rabindra—
nath Tagore's poem from 'Geetanjali' :
'Where the mind is_without fear and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free :
Where the world is not broken up into fragments by narrow domestic
walls :
Where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection :
' Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever widening
thought and action,
Into that heaven of freedom, my father, Let my country awake.‘

The poem was written at the turn of the century. Its historical
context was the ferment and anxiety of impending was and emergent natio—
nalism in India.
The dance is divided into eight sections conveying the poet's
vision through images, symbols and choreographic patterns. The abstract
visions have been given symbolic representation. The phrases 'mind with—
out fear, knowledge, broken up world, words of truth, tireless striving,
dead habit, ever widening thought and. action and heaven of freeedom
sound beautiful in poetry but needed 61 tangible form in dance. Sometimes
the form emerged from the prOCESS~Of rehearsal — watching the dancers'
interpretation, the character given to particular movement ideas. The
poem has been given visual form, with no spoken word, and the choreography integrated with the scenic design, music, and costumes and lighting.
