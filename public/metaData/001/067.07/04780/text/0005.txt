SHRI KHALED CHOWDHURY

Born in Kachhar, Assam
on'December 20, 1919, Khaled Chowdhury
used रंगु) paint at School; He became serious about this hobby only in
1943 when a portrait of Stalin earned him a lot of praise. His first
stage appearance was in his hometown, the play having been Bijan Bhatta—
charya's 'Jabanbandi'. Mr. Chowdhury' came to Calcutta for the first

time in 1944 to sing at the Anti—Fascist Writers' Conference and settled
in this city next year. When his voice proved unsuitable for singing,
he played percussion instruments as a member of the lPTA's ballet squad.
He took part in the IPTA's Shahider Dak (a shadow play with songs and
dances) in early 1947. Mr. Chowdhury left the IPTA and met Sombhu Mitra
in 1950 learning how to play the violin in the meantime. He designed
the set for Bahurupee's Dharmaghat in 1953. Then came Raktakarabi and
Putul Khela revolutionizing the concept of stage design in India. He
must be the only dessigner in the country not to have repeated himself
when two directors staged the same play. This happened with Pagla Ghoda
by Sombhu Mitra and Shyamanand Jalan, and with Putul Khela in Hindi,
directed by Tripti Mitra. Though Mr. Chowdhury decided to give up de—
-signing sets in rTripti Mitra's Arabdha. Natya Bidyalaya and Calcutta
Theatre have been able to overcome his reluctance. He is now associated
with Natya Shodh Sanathan and serves as the Secretary of an Organisation
for research in fold songs. A member of the West Bengal Natya Akademi,
Mr. Chowdhury received the Sangeet Natak Akademi award for stage design
in 1986. For his eminent contribution in the field of Indian Theatre,
we feel proud to feliqitate him.
