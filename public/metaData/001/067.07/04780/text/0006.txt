SHRI UTPAL DUTT

Born at Shillong (n1 March 29, 1929, Utpal Dutt was introduced
to Shakespeare, and theatre, by Geoffrey Kendal. He repaid the debt
by staging Othello, Macbeth and A Pﬁdsummer Night's Dream in Bengali
for the ldttle Theatre Group, founded in 1947. From Angar to Kallol
to Tiner Talowar his plays have been pursuing the Shakespearean ideal
of a dramatic structure at once loose and compact, An acknowledged
master of the spectacle in Indian 'Theatre, he has also experimented
with Street Theatre, professing to use the medium as a political weapon.
This is a consequence of his admiration for Bertolt Brecht,
of whose plays he has translated, and to whose 'Theatre in

a number
the GDR,

the Berliner Ensemble, he has been a frequent visitor. Dutt has worked
in the Jatra, one of his most memorable productions being Surya Shikar,
based on Brecht's The Life of Galileo. He has written controversial
books about Shakespeare's social conciousness and about Girish Chandra
Bengali Play—
Ghosh, whmn he considers the only Shakespearean among
wrights. His most famous acting role is perhaps the Lawyer Sam Liebowitz
in Manusher Adhikarey (Many consider this his finest production) but
Bhaktaprasad in Budo Shaliker Ghadey Roan marks him as the greatest
farceur in Bengali Theatre. Himself the director of five films, Dutt
has acted in films by Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak. He received
the Bharat Puraskar for his performance in Mrinal Sen's Bhuban Shome.
For his relentless fight for 61 Healthy Theatre Movement and for his
eminent contribution to the field of Indian Theatre, we feel proud
to felicitate him.
