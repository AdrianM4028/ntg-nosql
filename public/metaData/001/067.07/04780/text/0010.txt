bUilt with their

bones and blood the public theatre
in Calcutta. It was a strange time
in a strange city, where all art
therefore,
and
patronized,
was
controlled, by the nouveaux riches
whose colossal wealth was matched
only by their colossal ignorance.

make-believe world of the theatre.
One sell—out leads to another. The British government has just
clamped down on the theatre with its Dramatic Performances Act (1876),
and arrested the writer, the director and some leading actors of the

Great National Theatre and Birkrishna insists on the play

'Titu Meer'

being scrapped. Beni agrees and rides roughshod over the sentiments of
his players —— Basundhara, Haralal, Jalad, Kamini, Gobar, Jadugopal and, while food—riots go on in the streets, he is determined to stay
clear of politics.
But, as the curtain goes up on a mild satire, Beni comes on to“
tally drunk, and unexpected things begin to happen.
