The divisive and disintegrating
tendencies, rocking our subcontinent
at the moment, cannot possibly be
countered by politicians alone;
cultural workers do have a definite
role to play. NANDlKAR feels that an
interaction of multilingual and multi—
cultural theatre-forms on our soil
.
would be a modest step in this
direction. Further, we are aware that
Bengali culture, particularly theatre,
is presently passing through a face
of husky decadence and
confusion. An exposure to sundry
theatre-forms may be a step towards
a rejuvenation.
