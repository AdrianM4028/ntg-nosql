1 am a theatre person in an age
when very little theatre exists.

Big theatres and repertory companies are built in this country, but
do not function.

There exists a

good theatre school.

Even that

exists mostly for televisionâ€™s sake.
I am a desperate man.

I should be writing melancholy
love letters. I remember those last
days of autumn twilight, in Indian
theatre, before television set in.

It

was late sixties and early seven-

ties. It was the days of Dishantar,
of Mohan Rakesh and of my own
little Samudaya in Karnataka.
Even those days theatre did not
really exist.

But what little

existed, had a lovely face; the face
of anger and youth.

Theatre was angry with Society
then. But today society is angry
