Technicolor Dreams

Director's note
When I was offered the opportunity to work on the Naga theme I was very
excited. I have always felt a special attraction for the land and the people ofthis
region, probably because of my interest in ethnicity, power, identity and
nature. I believe that the subjects we handle in theatre should be socially and
politically relevant. Keeping this in mind I started evolving the play. No title, _no
text, only ideas, just visuals, images in my mind that I shared with the twenty
participants with whom I was supposed to work. Initially I was apprehensive to
open discussions on topics like ethnicity, society, belief and faith since they are
so complex; but gradually as we entered these areas, their complexities and
possibilities, the participants opened up, started sharing their views and
experiences. Sometimes we agreed and sometime we didn't. This doubled my
responsibility in terms of both conceptualization and execution.
’I’echm'colourDreams has been created in a very short span of ti me. It is a draft.
There is every possibility ofa better second draft that I hope to giveyou soon.
