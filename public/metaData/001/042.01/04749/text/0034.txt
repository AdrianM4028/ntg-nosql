The Play
The play is about the gradual submersion of folk art in the all-pervasive tide of
modernism. It centers round the wretched life of Nidhu Mondal a famed folk artist
of a bygone ere his nostalgia and pride about his past and his ultimate tragic
realization that he is no more than a victim of worldly indifference destined for
oblivion. In the tragic culmination of the play we see Nidhu, overwhelmed by the
blows of an unkind world and fate. waking up to the astonishing and ironic
realization that in his helplessness he has become a replica of the great tragic
heroes he once played on stage.
