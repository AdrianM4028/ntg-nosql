'Garo land). The play is based on the soeio—politieal history ol‘ the Garo people and
their armed resistanee against the British (1870—72). It begins with a grandmother
narratirig/recounting heroic tales lrom Garo mythology and moves on to the
episode of the martyr Toggan Nigmin/a who trained a group ol' Caro—Vouth and
led the attack against oliieers ol~ the British army.
