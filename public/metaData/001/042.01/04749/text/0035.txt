Director's Note
Nowadays we all seem to be gradually forgetting our cultural heritage. What we don't [ f
realize is that it is through this 'heritage' that we have our cultural pride. Nidhu

Mandal, the protagonist of the play, is a folk artiste who tries his level best to uphold l
and preserve folk culture. He is a devoted artiste and his humanism is evident in
the
manner in which he sacrifices his everything for his art. But now he is a captive who

has lost everything except his memories of an age gone by. In this play I have tried to
speak about the life ofsuch folk artistes and their folk art.
