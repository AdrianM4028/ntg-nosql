The Play
Shubha, an accomplished Dhulia [traditional Assamese dhol—player / drummer] is in
love with Ghunusa, his teacher's daughter, who is exceptionally gifted - 'lotus bloom in
her steps, the cuckoo sings in her gaze and she has only to wish and it rains.‘ The
villagers, battling a drought, arrange a ritualistic marriage of frogs to invoke rain but
it pours only when Ghunusa breaks into a dance. Damodar, Shubha's brother, is also
besotted by Ghunusa and asks for her hand in marriage. Ghunusa's brother,
Gambhir, unhappy with the proposition, proposes that Ghunusa marry the man
whose buffalo emerges winner in the buffalo fight. Shubha's buffalo wins; Ghunusa
confesses her love for Shubha; Putuli, Damodar's neglected wife is invited into the
fold, and the community joyously celebrates the renewal of life.
