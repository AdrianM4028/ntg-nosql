Director's note
। have been greatly influenced by the story of Ghatotkach. In the present socio—
economic and socio—political environment we often see people who are rejected and
marginalized by society, sacrificing their lives for unworthy reasons. Such people do
whatever society asks them to do, unconditionally and in a selfless manner. And
since I believe that this is a serious problem in modern society, । have tried to reflect
it in my play.
