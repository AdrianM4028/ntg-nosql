The Play
Ghatotkach was the son of Kirat Kurnari Hirirnba and the second Pandava prince, Bhim.
Despite being the son of the great Arya Prince, from his childhood Ghatotkach was
deprived of his father's affection and love. However, when it came to the great war on
the battleﬁeld of Kurukshetra, the Pandavas realized that they needed him. Reminding
him of his duty as a son of the royal clan, they bought him into the battle despite the
fact that they had never accepted him as their own. Ghatotkach, therefore. joined the
battle against the Kauravas, sacriﬁcing his life by doing so, to honour the wishes of
the same father and family that had rejected him as long as they had not needed him.

The play questions this convenience—based acceptance of Ghatotkach and is
presented as a tribute to all others deprived and used like him.
