A tragedy is stealthin creeping into every house. In

the materialistic world of today everything is at a pass,
Relations are

breaking,

Love and Affections are lost,

Values are disappearing.

All this combined create on

atmosphere which is taking us towards darkness.

This is what AAGHOSH reveals.
