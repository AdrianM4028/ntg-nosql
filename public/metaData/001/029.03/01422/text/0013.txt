FROM T H E GA R D E N

The Sun like Midas
is changing every thing

into gold by its mere touch.

The Solitary rose

is shinng like
a king ruby

in the dark velvet of leaves.

The young banana leaf
is fluttering nervously
at the advances of the wind.

The Bulbul is singing sweetly
some where among the trees
and the earthworm is crowling
under the rn u d .

l some times wonder
if Bulbul lends
some of its songs
to the earth worm
will the garden

be a better peace?
