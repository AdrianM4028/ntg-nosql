'The Karamazov Brothers' is a two volume
novel by Dostoyevsky. It was first dramatised and
presented by Moscow Art Theatre in early 20th century.
The play was directed by Russian legend Nemirovich
Danchenko. This monumental play was divided in two
parts and shown on two successive evenings.
Recently, 'The Karamazov Brothers' was
dramatised in English in America and was edited
considerably to make it presentable. It was titled as
'Brothers Karamazov'.
'Brothers Karamazov' is the story of a broken
family which strives to get united. All three brothers,

after many years, arrive suddenly at their father,
Fyodor Karamazov's house. The eldest son Dimitry

The second son, Ivan, a freelance writer on religion
and theology, has come in search of solutions to
certain questions, and the youngest one, Alyosha,

disciple of a religious guru, Zossima, enters the scene
to unite his broken family. Does he succeed and to
what extent?
