Director's Note

Surprises never cease.

An anti establishment artist like Dario F0 for the Nobel Prize. And he becomes a Nobel Laureate!
(By his own admission, he was the most surprised.)

The Virtuous Burglar is just that. A surprising piece. A revelation at every turn. Essentially based
on a classic confusion of identities - it leads the viewers on a wild chase of discovery. And somewhere on this trail, just maybe, it makes us wonder about our own fantasies, desires and lusts.

We were sorely tempted to lndianise it. The burglar could have been 'Natwarlal' or maybe even a

professional bureaucrat, protesting about politicians' pilferage. But we rejected it as 'surface
relevance alteration'.

In the turbulent seventies, Dario Fo's wife, Franca Rame was violated. Year before last Fo wrote to
the President of Italy for justice, followed by his wife's appeal. The response was recognisably
inept. A farce which i had very much wanted to use as the ending of the play hinting at the
ongoing farce of life — a Nobel Laureate seeking justice and yet . .. The cast wasn't sure it'd
resonate with audiences' political will. They felt it was sensationalising an important event and l
bowed to democratic veto. After all Comrnedia de L'Arte (the style of the production) demands an
ensemble democracy.

So be it.
