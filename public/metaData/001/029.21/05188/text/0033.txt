TOTA KAHINI (Sone ka Pinjra)
by Rabindranath Tagore

Conceptual Translation : Anuttama Ghosh
From the early childhood days Gurudev Flabindranath had an antipathy towards
the prevailing education system in the country as it failed to cater to his sensitive mind.
Education is not meant to produce cramming parrots but to develop open, inquisitive.
healthy sympathetic and imaginative minds that would explore the unknown horizon to
benefit the whole humanity. Education is also meant to develop the finer qualities of
human mind that we call aesthetics. to make the world a better place to live in. The
present system of education tails short of achieving these goals. So in Tote Kahlnl the
allegorical part lashes out at the system to make it more humane.
The imbecile kind is very happy as all is well in his kingdom. The two nephews

are his ears and eyes and the administrative machinery goes on at their whims. Once
the trio spots a 'l'ota singing merrily in its own surroundings. This can not be allowed to
go on. so the Tota is caged, taught thousands of wisdom, has to gulp down important
heavy
notes. Finally the enraged king kills the Tota as it refuses to learn. Arenâ€™t the
burdens oi syllabus killing thousands of innocent little souls?
