DELHI CHILDREN’S THEATRE
Annual Report for the year 1997-98
With the ending of the year 31st March 1997, the Delhi Children’s Theatre
stepped into 44 years of its existance.

It is heartening to note the progress made by DCT year after year. This
voluntary cultural organisation continues to play a vital role in training children of
different schools in India’s capital in creative drarnatics, dancing, music, ballet and
group singing. It maintains a high standard of children’s cultural shows.

The DCT has spread its activities in various corners of Delhi, despite several
problems and financial strain faced by it.
Our progress is possible due to the whole hearted support and co-operation

we have been getting from our members, our staff, our institution members and
various schools of Delhi.

Chattopadhyaya were our patrons. We got lot of inspiration and guidance from
