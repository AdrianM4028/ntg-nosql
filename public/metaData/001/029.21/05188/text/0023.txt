“JADU KA KUAN”
(Magical Well)

Written 5y ‘Elinar Louser

This play depicts how a “Magical Well” fulfills the wishes of
the children by which they would get happiness in future.

All the children asked for different wishes but no one could 9'
real happiness in their future life except for a boy and a girl who
asked happiness for others by entertaining them through dance
and music.

The moral of the play tells us that those who live for others
happiness they are the happiest people in the world.
