RAJAN WITH SATYAJIT RAY

This is the story of Amit-a stage actor,
whose life is caught in the whirlpool of vain struggle for existence and
utmost frustration thereof.
The story begins ironically enough

RAJAN IN ABHINETA

with the theatrical

death of the actor

on stage. After all the furore of acclarnation has di
ed away in the empty
auditorium, the dead actor gets up slowly from his de
ad posture vis-a-vis
his empty stomach and bitter realities of life. The show manager is not to

be seen anywhere and there goes the paltry sum he was prom
ised to be
paid tonight. Look, where his irrepressible love for theatre has bang
ed him
down with. Can he ever forget the days when he, as a struggling actor,
was too busy rehearsing his role to attend to his poor old beloved Madh
u
ditched him in favour of that rich guy, Rituraj ? And, just look where he
stands now after all those excruciatingly agonising years of sacrifice and
humiliation ! How can he hanker

he wants just a meagre piece of bread to keep his body and soul together.

And at this moment the actor can perceive a piece of bread lying on the
ground, the remnant thrown out by somebody. The famished actor grabs

it greedily and starts eating. And thus begins another chapter of struggle
for existence.
