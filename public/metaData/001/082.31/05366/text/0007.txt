I would deem it a pleasant day for me to witness the success of the celebration of the World Theatre Day
1984. In fact we intended to gear our efforts for serving for little better â€˜cause by celebrating this
World Theatre Day 84. I personally have much sympathy for the people who are working for theatre.

In a country like india they need much help and support in all respects other wise they would be forced

understanding for

the

Socio - cultural

development of society in its true senses.

When I thought of the people working for Theatre and at the moment are unable to manage the basic
needs to survive in this world, I thought I must do something for them Now. We have taken
a decision
to introduce THEATRE AND FILM UNIT RELIEF FUND. The very idea of celebrating the world Theatre
Day did not strike to me as a purpose for entertainment, joy and pleasure but to be much more mea
ningful
and relevant to its purpose in its true sense, One of the major aims of the world The
atre Day is to bring
to--gether the largest possible number of participants to affirm the ideals of peace and mu
