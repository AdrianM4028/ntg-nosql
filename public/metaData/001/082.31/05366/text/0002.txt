In 1963, 65
countries and

120 to 150 radio and television outlets.

Each year, on this occasion, there appear hundreds of articles in the world press, along with numerous

posters commemorating the event.

The traditional International Message has had for its author, successively, Jean Cocteau, Arthur Miller,
Laurence Olivier, J. L. Barrault, Rene Maheu, Helene Weigel, Shostakovich, Miguel Angtl Asturias, Peter
Brook, Pablo Neruda, Maurice Bejart, Luchino Visconti, Richard Burton, Ellen Stewart, Eugene lonesco
and Radu Beligan. Printed in theatre programmes and in newspapers, retransmitted on the radio and
television translated in to 12 to 15 languages, this message enjoyed a very wide dessemination.
Faced with the ever increasing difficulty of finding authors who are known all over the world,it has
been decided that as from 1962 each country would have its own message a national character but

internationally inspired.
