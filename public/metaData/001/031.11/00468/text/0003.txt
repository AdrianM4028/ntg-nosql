The P lay

From times imrnernorial the theme of sin has fascinated mankind. On a
Subconscious plane perhaps the sinner has always been a figure secretly admired
and even envied. That is why his rejection by Society is always so total.
And vehement. There lurks in the depth of the human mind that secret fear of
identifying with the sinner. Hence the compulsion of rneting out punishment
which is often more heinous than the evil deed.

Vasanakand follows two people as they stumble along a tortuous path leading
to their ultimate destruction. It is an intensely personal saga of a brother and
sister sharing a forbidden relationship. And yet, on a higher level, one wonders
if the playwright had the sexually repressed Indian male in mind when he wrote
the play. 80 deep rooted are our complexes that we are unable to accept the
most natural relationship of all-that between a man and a woman. To have a
friend from the Opposite sex is frowned upon, but one may ’make’ any number
of brothers and sisters. Such is our social hypocracy.

Vasanakand is larger than life. It sets itself no limit and roams unhindered with
the fury and passion of a tormented beast. While delving into the depths of the human
mind, it comes face to face with various relevant issues like mob psychology, ritual
and social stricture. At the base there is also that inevitable struggle between love
and sheer passion. The requirements of the play are so demanding that one had to
throw restraint to the winds while bringing it to life on the stage. I have tried

to preserve its nightmarish quality-for that is what this play has been to
