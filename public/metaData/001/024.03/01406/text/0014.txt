D IRECTOR'S NOTE

"Governments in our time — all of them — the most
despotic and liberal alike—have become organisations ३
of violence employing four methods. The first and
oldest is intimidation, the second is corruption. the

third is hypnotisation of the people, and the fourth is
military enforcement...
TOLSTOY, 'the Kingdom of God is within you'

I had originally conceived of the play being performed in modern dress—in sarees and.
khaki uniforms, with guns instead of spears.

The democratic processes, of” the workshop

brought forth the more conventional design that is materialized on stage ; in the settings,
costumes and choreography.

This is mentioned only to suggest the extent to which I thought the play could be related
to contemporary times (viz. the Beirut massacre). Repeatedly, in critical works, one.
finds the label 'The greatest anti-war play ever written' attached to it. in its time it must
have done to the Greeks what 'Apocalypse Now' has recently done to the Americans on
film; ‘a harrowing shock of the reality of the ’glorious' fruits of war.

Euripides must have been a courageous man to malign the gods and heroes of Homer, to
bring his flights of epic fancy down into the dust and misery of a small group of women

—Ati1e ultimate sufferers of the men's war-mongering.

That he painted the Greeks and

their victory in such clear, uncompromising terms as brutal, stupid and callous—that he
presented this picture of the Greeks to a Greekau‘dience—are testimony to his having

been a sensitive, independent thinker; or else to the extent of the freedom of speech in
Greek democracies of 416 BC’., when the play was first presented.

"You Greeks !" says Hecuba in the play, "Your spears are sharp, but not your wits !"
