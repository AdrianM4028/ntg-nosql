Synopsis
in

The theme ofthe play is the changing social fabric in the rural society
Himachal Pradesh. The play depicts the conflicts between

"No-changers" and "Pro-changers" though in a subtle way. The loudness
of the play has the under current of the conﬂict between the forces of
change and status quo. The status quoers still hold the belief that all that

existed in the past- thoughts. institutions. establishments were sublime
and hence could not and should not be changed. To them everything
modem is leading the society towards the ultimate and inevitable disaster.
The pro-changers. on the other hand. believe that old is not always

gold and change is inevitable. absence or denial of which means
death--the death of a society and system.
r"
में
The no- change syndrome gets weaker and weaker with the passage

of time and pro-change forces get momentem.

Director’s Note
"BAA MULAHIZA HOSHIYAR“ is a complex play in which three
stories run simultaneously. One story is the hang over of the old
generation regarding British raj. The second is the struggle of the younger
generation with the old values and the third is the obstructionist tactics
of the ofﬁcials who stand in the way of the change from the old order to
the new one.
The theme of the play is univtarsal atleast in the rural world which
consﬂtute over eighty per cent of the world population. There is a
perpetual struggle for change in the entire social fabric values and
cultural traits in the rural societies all the world over.
