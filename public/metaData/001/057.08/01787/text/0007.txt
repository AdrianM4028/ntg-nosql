The-Kong-Tek. Both the Chieftians took a blood oath while the holy
Mountain Khangzendzonga- the Five Hidden Treasures- was the main
witness of the. historic even at Kabi Loong Tsok- We erected the Stone.
Since then. Phang Lhabsol or the festival of the Holy Witnes is being

representing the different ages of history through which the story passes.
