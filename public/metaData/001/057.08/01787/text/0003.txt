The play starts with an old storyteller who is narrating an interesting
but imaginary story to his audience. He talks about a prince of an

iniaginary state. who once violated the will ‘of his father and o )ened the
lock ofa m sterious tunnel situated some where in the palace iere entry
was stric y prohibited. Through this tunnel the rince reaches to an
unknown country where all human values were )ased on money and

money alone. He notices that day and night people were rimning after

money and using fair and foul means to earn it. The prince realized that
none of them was satisﬁed and happy and everybody held money.

responsible for the shortcomings of their life.
The prince felt pity on them and summoned the Goddess of Space

to provide them money so that they could live peacefully and happily.
Goddess blessed them and the ver next morning every member of that
society started‘gettin two laklis o Rupees ever day from his pillow.
How this

ow o mone ultimately brin s t lat society to the edge of

ﬁnal disaster and how tot

create new horrible dimensionsbecome the central idea of the play.
At last. after snubbing all the sacred values of life and exploiting all
available means for personal ends the innate hun

r of power and

authority. distorts and disfigures the individual and 1e society in such
a wa that man loses his identity by transforming from man to a worm
and rom a living being to a commodity.

deep satire.followed )y gripping tragedy for human resourcefulhiess and
limitations. comes to an end with a humanly devised explosion.

Director’s Note
The story of the play predominants contains the elements of fantasy
and imaginative situations. but the basic thread in the approach of
dealing with the situation in different areas of the prOduction is quite

realistic and down to earth. the text is treated in performance by an acting

style blending realism and fantasy.
