The significance of this
traditional story about a
hero's valiant expedition
against the two Suns,
appearing day and night
alternately, lies in the name
of the protagonist himself Khawai (People's) Nung (i.e.

Manung, inherant or latent)
Jeng (i.e. Ling Jel, spirit or
courage) Piba (to give) Yek
(i .e. Yeknaba, enemy) Ma
(i .e Manghanba, to destroy)
Hao (i .e. Hourakpa, emerg—
i ng out) Tang (i .e. Tung
Tawa, patiently or firmly) La
(War or civil war of rebellion
or revolution) —- 'the giver
of the people‘s latent spirit
and destroyer of the enemy
by building up with
patience and firmness a
revolution of the people‘.

Drawing on an old Manipuri
legend, we choose to use
the actors as tools to project
the idea behind the legend
rather than the story ,- and
explore the main idea closely
in terms of the present
political crisis of the country,
and the disintegrating trends
affecting the unity of the
country. The productional
style represents an attempt to
draw abstract elements from
our living performing arts and
create contemporary images
through dance, movement,
the martial arts and song. The
style is basically expressionist
and abstract, and is therefore
different from the general use
of typically Mani puri devices
and elements. The artistic
thrust of the production is
towards the creation of visual
images at a stylized level. We
concentrate on the search for
a new language of theatre
indigenous to our regional
roots, and responsive to
universal experience.
