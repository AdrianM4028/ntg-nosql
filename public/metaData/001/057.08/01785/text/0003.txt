Synopsis
'Ras' (Date Juice) is the

means of livelihood of young
Motalef. After the death of
his preceptor Rajek Mridha,
Motalef manages to get the
contract for collection of half
share of the juice in lieu of
his service.

But he is in search of some
expert ladies for preparing
good quality of date molasses from this juice. Moreover, after the death of his
wife, he also looks for a
beautiful girl who will be—
come a real companion in
his solitary life. He falls in
love with Phoolbanu. But
Phoolbanu's father demands
a huge amount which is be—
yond Motalef's limit. Deject—
ed, Motalef decided to wait,
till he earns that amount of
m oney.
Motalef needs money and to
get money, he has to ﬁnd
someone who is skilled in
preparing good quality of
date molasses. Motalef approaches Maju Khatun, widow of Rajek. Maju is hesitant,
but ultimately agrees to join
and marry Motalef.

Maju, on the other hand, finds
it very difficult to manage. It
gives her much pain to hear
the different episodes of
Motalef's happily married life.
However, she finally agrees to
marry Nadir Seikh, a boatman.

Time, the ultimate judge,
waits for none. Next year Motalef acquires more juice than
last year. But the skill which
made his business proﬁtable
has gone. Phulbanu has no
expertise in making molasses.
The result is obvious—there is
no demand in the market.
Motalef tries his best to teach
her the way how to make
good molasses, but all in
vain.
