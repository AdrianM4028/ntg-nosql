Director's Note
The play documents the
unscrupulous exploitation of
the Oraons of Western
Orissa, a hardworking, Godfearing, trustful community,
till they rise in revolt in a
violent manifestation.
Centering on the tribal
psyche, the production
amalgamates several
conventions. The speech and
sound patterns are folk-real,
the lighting simple, and
stage/costumes suggestive.

No stage props are in use.
The action is predominantly
mimetic. The materials used
in the set design and for
costumes — hessian, bhogei,
jhudi, kula, kulei, tati etc.
made of bamboo sticks and
the skin of banana plants —
are part of the milieu of tribal
life.

who ensures the welfare of

Baisakhu and his wife
Sam bari have a daughter
Budhni who studies in the
local Ashram School.
Sam bari, his hardworking
wife, supports the fam i ly
