The Director

Sy n op sis

Rajkamal Naik has been active
in theatre for the last 93
years, with 37 directorial
works to his credit, along
with 50 appearances as an
actor. His theatre activity at a
more Specialized level has
involved conducting theatre
workshops for tribal children
under the auspices of the
South-Central Zonal Cultural
Centre, Nagpur, and workshops on the use of theatre
for literacy and dissemination
of knowledge of general sci ence. Has been associated
with the Rangmandal at the
Bharat Bhavan, Bhopal.

It is a story of the neglect and
the consequent pollution and
decay of a river after men
have explioted it to the fullest
possible extent. Kaki recounts
the story of the river on the
occasion of the birth of Narmada, daughter of Kanhaiya.
While the river and its friends,
the birds, are tormented by
the rampant pollution of the
river. Balabhandra, Rahman
and other conscientious vi l—
lagers notice how the chemical pollution frorn a riverside
factory is killing the fish, and
raise their voices of protest
against it. But the village headman and the polluters gang
up to frustrate their endeavour. Hal f-rotten corpses are
set afloat in the river, polluting
it still further. Kanhaiah returns
from the village fair to find his
daughter sick, from the polluted water. The river itself is dyi ng under the assault of the
deadly chemicals. The birds
approach the men of the vi llage and try to arouse their
awareness.

Director's Note
Growing out of a concern
with the pollution of the environment, the production
combines folk and dramatic
styles, and makes use of folk
cults, fantasy, dance move—
ments and straight acting.
