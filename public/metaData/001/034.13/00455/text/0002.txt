The Performers

The members of the BRECHTIAN MIRROR are admirers of Brechtian style of
theatre. The group was formed in 1970 at New Delhi, with an objective of
i-nculcating and propagating the forms and styles of his ‘epic theatre’. Since its
inception, the group has so far produced 19 productions which have been widely
acclaimed by the public and the press alike.
The Brechtian Mirror in selecting Mahasveta Devi’s SRI SRI GANESH MAHIMA
had in mind the potentalities it offered in its adaptation to the Brechtian style.
Attempt has been made to use this style to stir the intelligence, the feelings and the
imagination of the audience; drama not just to hypnotise or entrance the audience
but to continually remaind them that what they are watching is a representation, a
vehicle for ideas or a fact. As Brecht uncouthly labelled his devise as ‘alienation’ - an
art of placing an action at a distance so that it can be judged objectively and seen in
relation to the world around it.
