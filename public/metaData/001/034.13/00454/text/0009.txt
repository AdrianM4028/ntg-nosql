Durrenmatt has termed his plays ‘comedies’ and in Problems of the Theatre (1955),
he expressed the belief that tragedy could no longer be written because the modern age, lacking
a well-ordered world —with established standards of guilt and retribution—is not suited for it.

Durrenmatt didnot want to be regarded as spokesman of any movement or a point of view
in theatre, he wrote, “The stage is not a battleﬁeld f'or theories, philosophies and manif‘estoes,
but rather an instrument whose pOSSibilities I seek to know by playing with it.”

Durrenmatt’s successful radio scripts include, The Vega Enterprise ( 1956) —~- a science
ﬁction; and A Nocturnal Conversation with DeSpised Man (1957). His known novels are Greek
YOuth Seeks a Greek Maid (1955), and The Deadly Game (1956).
