THE PERFORMERS

The members of the BRECHTIAN MIRROR are humble admirers
of the Brechtian style of theatre. The group was formed in 1970, at
New Delhi, with an objective of inculcating and propagating the forms
and styles of the ‘epic theatre.’

Since its inception, the group has

produced 17 productions which have been widely acclaimed by the

public and the press alike.

In this production of Fredrich

Durrenmatt’s THE VISIT, a

Hindustani adaptation, the group is presenting a play by one of the
major theatrical ﬁgures of the mid-twentieth century whose techniques

are inﬂuenced by Brecht, yet they are always varied and fresh.

The Brechtian Mirror endeavours to present to the Delhi stagea theatre which is experimental in style—yet it is thought-provoking.
It encourages young directors and actors to be a part of this cause, and
in

particular brings together the professionals and

together on stage.
