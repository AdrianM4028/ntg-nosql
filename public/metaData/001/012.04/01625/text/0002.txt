“The Waltz of the Toreadors”, a great hit in Paris where it
opened several years ago, has won similar laurels at the New York.
London and Los Angeles productions.

Playwright Jean Anouilh has. with “Waltz of the Toreadors",
added considerably to his stature as France's foremost contemporary
dramatist and commentator on modern manners and morals. The
translation, by Lucienne Hill. retains all of Anouilh’s original Gallic
wit and charm.

The play revolves around, not the usual triangle, but a typical
French “rectangle”. Its main characters are an aging general. his
shrewish wife, an early “amour” of the general. and his callow
male secretary eager to “learn about life”.
