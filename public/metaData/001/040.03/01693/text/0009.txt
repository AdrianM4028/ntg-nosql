The British rule, created many posts.
Gaonbura was one of them.
This post had
no reward for the job done and no recognition for the responsibility shouldered.
'I he play has been woven round Bhogman the son of a “Bayan” (Percussion player)
who
is considered to be a distinguised and respected person within the village communi

The plot unfolds with Bhogman being forced to appear before the police Inspector
as a load bearer by Kacl ukl 011a at other Gaonbura against Bhogman 5 wishes.
Instead of hearing Bhogman’ s plea for mercy, the police inspector derived sadistic
pleasure in burdeninghim with a basket full of chicken. Bhogman felt humiliated
because he considered it a direct assault on his self respect To escape such humiliation Rongdoi, his wife, advised him to be come a Gaonbura himself. In accordance "
with the advice of Rongdoi, Bhogman by gleasing the palm of the Maujadar

managed to have an audience with the British Sahib Mr, Young Convinced of Bhogman’s
innocence and sincerity Mr. Young

declared him

Gaonbura.

Disaster ﬁlled Bhogman’s life with the acceptance of the honorary job. With the
pressure of government duties he was forced to neglect his home, also had to make

offerings to Sahibs every now and then,

To make these offerings Bhogman had to

resort to dubious methods. In the process he incurred the displeasure of widowed
Bheleu, poor Billat, Pejan and many others. Calamities in the shape ofentagonism
of the poor villagers, lawsuit brought by
Bheleu
and ﬁnally the seizer of all

his properties for non payment of his personal revenues descended en the life of
Bhogman ultimately realise the false status symbol that has been associated with
the position of Gaonbura and according to his wife’s advice gave up his hard
earned position.
