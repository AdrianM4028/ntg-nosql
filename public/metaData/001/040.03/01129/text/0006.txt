An Interview with the Director

Could you please tell us something about the origin of this trend of using
traditional theatre and dance forms in modern play production which has
now become a fashion among theatre people?
It is only during sixties

this trend

has been recognised.

Directors like

Habib Tanvir and B. V. Karanth and some directors of west Bengal tried
this first and found it succesful. But in the early days it was not appreci-

ated so much as it is being done today.

The traditional elements must be

used in the play only if it is required by the thematic content of the play. It
is not just utilising one form or other, it is the tradition reacting to the
modern situation. It is true that trend is becoming p0pular nowadays, but
there is no point in following the trend blindly without knowing the roots
of the tradition.

Do you think that this kind of theatre would be the right Indian alternative
to the existing western influenced theatre?
I won't say anythirg about the various kinds of theatre practiced today.
But in this kinct of theatre, I find larger scope to make any play highly
aesthetic and visually pleasirg. A modern man can't deny the greatness
of classical dance and music.

We can't deny Balasaraswathi, Pandit Ravi

Shankar or even sonal Mansing‘h today.

Only after a rigorous practice continuously for many years the traditional

performers (both classical and folk) could appear on stage.

Where as the

actors of modern theatre while doing a production in a traditional style learn

in a Short time certain elements of traditional forms and take a few dance
movements costumes or make up or speech patterns and use in their play....

You are very right.

We must take only the essence of classical forms.

Ours is not a full fledged classical performance.

I want to exploit it fully in modern play production.
