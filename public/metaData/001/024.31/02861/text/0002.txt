I am happy to learn that Begum Akhtar Academy (Kaladharmi) is presenting a multimedia mega
show on Baba Bulleh Shah and other Suﬁ Saints of the Indian subcontinent on 24th January, l998
in New Delhi. I hope that the show will increase awareness among the people of Pakistan, Bangladesh,
Nepal and Sri Lanka about the many and vibrant common strands in our cultural heritage.
I send my good wishes to the organisers and participants on this occasion.
