with the tortures of hell;
" And let him revel in the pleasure of heaven,
who labels me an Arian.

He was penalised and tortured for propagating what he believed to be the true message of.the Prophet — universal brotherhood.
Nevertheless, he spoke out loud and clear denouncing empty ritual and the external observances of religion :
The Muslims are averse to being cremated
The Hindus are loth to be buried
Both die quarrelling over this wrangle.
Such is the case of enmity
between them!

Despite his ofﬁcial persecution, Bulleh Shah’s message of love and brotherhood spread far and wide, delivered directly
in his robust, tuneful songs. He is regarded today as the greatest mystic poet of his time and his compositions are
recognised as the highest achievement of Sufi literature.
When he died in I758, Bulleh Shah was refused a burial in a Muslim graveyard. Qasur (now in Pakistan), where he
was eventually laid to rest, is a place of pilgrimage today.
Bulleh Shah’s creed is best expressed in the following verse :
I am free! I am unshackled!

I am neither sick nor a physician,
I am neither a high-caste nor a downtrodden
I
I am not constrained anywhere
I visit the tavern without praise or blame
Wherefore do you ask the essence of Bulleh?

He is unbegetting and unbegotten.
