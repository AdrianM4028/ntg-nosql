STEEL HUTHOHIW 0F ll'llel umman

There has been a little bit of steel in all of us since time irnrnernorial, literally and metaphorically. In fact, steel
has been an important cog in the wheel of progress of mankind, more so in the last two centuries. Steel, or its
less reﬁned forms, is the only metal that finds mention in the metaphysical expression of Sufi literature.
This year as SAIL completes 25 fruitful years, forging ahead faster and higher, we thought it proper to commemorate
the ocassion by bringing to the fore this strong link. The innate strength of Sufi poetry and the innate strength
of steel which have given so much joy and meaning to our lives in India have been intricater and artistically
'
interwoven by Kaladharmi in the form of this ballad.
‘

'

Rooh-e-Ishq, a ballad drama, which in itself is an amalgamation of colloquial Punjabi, Urdu and various dialects of
the Indo-Gangetic plain, presents the transition from classical to contemporary highlighting the true essence of
८
universal love — the underlying principle of Sufi philosophy.

We in SAIL are proud to present Rooh-e—lshq this evening.
We thank you for being with us today and hope you will enjoy the show.
