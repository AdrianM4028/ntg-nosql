actors strut about the stage with a
violent thumping of the feet, throw
their hands about, and the execute

This group is performing Keechaka
Vadharn, a popular episode from
the Mahabharata:
0n losing their kingdom at the
game of dice, the Pandavas go into
exile. Bhirna assumes the disguise
of a cook and joins the household
of King Virata where Draupadi is
also employed as a maid to queen
Sudakshina. Sudakshina’s brother
Keechaka covets the beautiful
Draupadi. Bhima, in the garb of
Draupadi, lures Keechaka to the
palace at night and kills him.
