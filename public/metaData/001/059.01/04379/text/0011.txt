KARNATAKA
This form of folk theatre from north
Karnataka has a one-play
repertoire and is distinguished by
its musical content. The music is an
interesting blend of Carnatic and
Hindustani systems. It is usually
performed in the open air and runs
through the whole night when
presented in its entirety.

Originally written by a folk poet,
Aparala Tammanna, in the early
19धा century, Sri Krishna Parijat was
refined and popularized later,
around AD. 1870, by Kulgod
Tammanna of Cokalk Taluk who
Mallikarjuna enhanced the original play by
M uda kavi 8
adding his own lyrics and staged it
Party, Hospet as a full-fledged play incorporating
elements from local folk forms and
the Tamasha of neighbouring
Maharashtra. The dramatic
structure is simple and uses
versified dialogue which enriches
both the poetic and musical content
of the play. Krishna’s costume is
distinguished by his blue kurta and
a pagdi on his head. Kaujalagi
Nungarnrna was the first actress

who entered the domain of an allmale cast in 1980. Today there are
several professional groups who
perform widely in the region.
Musical instruments like
harrnoniurn, Tabla and cymbals are
used during the performance.

Sri Krishna Parijat takes its story
from the Bhagavata. Narada
presents the heavenly Parijat flower
to Krishna. He in turn gives it to
Rukmini who wears it in her hair.
Krishna’s other wife, Satyabhama, is
jealous and demands that she
should be given one also. Krishna
attempts to get it from the tree
which blooms in lndra’s own
garden Nandanvan, and, when he
is unable to do so, he invades the
city of Arnaravati. He uproots the
tree after a fierce duel and plants it
in Satyabhama’s courtyard, which
makes her proud.
