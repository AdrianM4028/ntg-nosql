Prahlad Natak is a form of
traditional theatre with a one-play
repertoire from the southern
districts 'of Orissa; it is commonest
in Ganjam. It is performed in the
open on a five- or six-tiered stage,
at the summit of which
Hiranyakashipu’s throne is placed.
The performance of the play is
highly operatic, with songs ,
melodramatic dialogue and
acrobatics. This unique theatre
embodies many of the rich folk
classical and traditions of Orissa.

homeland of Prahlad Natak, had
18 feudatory chiefs who used to
call themselves Rajas, though
they did not have the status of
rulers. Virtually, they were big

wealthy, these Rajas were great
patrons of art, literature, and
culture. In this they vied with each
other. Three of the noted poets of

great lover of poetry but also of
music, dance and drama. It is he
who first conceived Prahlad Natak.
He ruled over his territory from
1857 to 1905. It is reported that
because of his liberal patronage of
the arts, he ran into debts and
could not pay the annual revenue
to the British government, for which
the government sold the estate to
the Raja of Vijayanagaram.
The text of Prahlad Natak, which
contains 120 songs, was written by
Gopinath Parichha who belonged to
the court of Raja Ramakrishna
Chhotray of Jalantar (now in
