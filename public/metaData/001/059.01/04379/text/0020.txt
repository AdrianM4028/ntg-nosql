Nacha Party,
Bhopal

Nacha is a folk theatre of
Chhattisgarh state. It is a
predominantly operatic form where
narration and prose dialogue are
interspersed with music and dance.
The dramatic structure is simple
and the themes revolve around
social, and often political, subjects.
The Dholak and harrnoniurn
provide instrumental support.
'Rammat’ is an integral part of the
Nacha theatre. Here, the humorous
element predominates. The satirical
performance, held in open air, is an
all-night affair enjoyed by large
audiences in the villages of the
region. Female roles are played by
men in this theatre. The stage is
bare and no special costumes are
used.
Nacha troupes are to be found in
all large villages. Many of the
performers are amateurs, though
some supplement their income by
their art. Performances are held on
various social occasions including
marriages and festivals — among
them the Ganesh festival.
