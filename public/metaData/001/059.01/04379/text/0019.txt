Kutubpur
Ga mbhira
Dal, Malda

Gambhira is widely performed in
northern Bengal on the occasion of
the Gajan festival during Chaitra
Sankranti. The worshippers of Shiva
take a vow during this period and
leave their homes to congregate at
various places of worship where
they sing and dance for several
days in praise of the deity. The
songs tell the story of Shiva and the
vigorous dance movements imitate
his Tandava dance.
The Gambhira worship-cum-festival
is celebrated throughout the entire
district of Maldah, though a few
rituals of Siva worship are observed
in the name of Gambhira in the
adjoining districts of West Dinajpur
and Murshidabad. The Gambhira
mask dance is to a considerable
extent primitive in form. The
difference between Gambhira with
other mask forms of Bengal is
based on religion. The masks
generally were originally made of
mango or fig wood and were kept
and worshipped generation after
generation. It is customary on the
part of the dancer to observe purity
and austerity during the festival.
