Ankia Bhaona developed in the
Satras of Assam. The play is
performed in the village Narnghar.
A series of rituals precedes the
actual presentation of the play,
which is held through the night.
Traditional music and dance are an
essential part of the theatrical
presentation.
The plays are based on Vaishnava
themes, particularly from the
Ramayana and the Bhagavata.
Mahaprabhu Shri Shri
Shankaradeva, the foremost
spiritual leader and reformer of
Assam in the 15th century, and his
foremost disciple Shri
Madhavadeva composed and
presented plays in Ankia Nat, which
is a tradition still in practice today.
The language of Ankia Bhaona is
an interesting mixture of Sanskrit
and Assamese with Brajbhasha,
Maithili and Bhojpuri.

ln Ankia Bhaona performance two
groups of musicians participate.
The vocal music is accompanied on
the Mridanga (Khol) and cymbals.

Various kinds of masks, distinctive
costumes and make-up are used by
different characters. The Sutradhar
plays an important role and sings
the Nandi in Sanskrit announcing
the subject of the play. The musical
compositions, known as Borgeet,
follow the Dhrupad tradition, and
the dance movements have a
definite classical tradition.
