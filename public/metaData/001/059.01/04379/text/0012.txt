Tamasha is a traditional theatre
form of Maharastra. Tamasha is a
Persian word which traveled to
Maharastra and Deccan through
the Moghul armies. It means fun,
play, entertainment. During the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, this form was at its
height.

During Peshwa rule, boys acted
women’s roles. They were called
nachya poryas (dancing lads). Today
there are eight hundred full-ﬂedged
Tamasha troupes in Maharashtra.
Most of them come from the
Pawala community.

The stage is a low platform,
surrounded on three sides by
curtains. In cities a regular
proscenium stage is used. In the
village square the play opens with
two drummers, the Dholkiwala and
the Halgiwala, who are present
throughout the performance. The
Dholkiwala has a long, horizontal

player, leaning forward, balances
the drum on one outstretched knee,
the other foot slanting behind. This
characteristic stance makes the
player look as if he were constantly
ready to spring.
The Halgi is a small drum made of
a wooden hoop with the skin of a
goat’s belly tightly stretched over
one side and the other open. The
elastic tissues of the guts weave
through the steel rings bordering
the hoop. The player heats the
instrument over a fire and tightens
the skin further. He keeps it at chin
level, gripping it in his left hand,
and holding a short curved cane
stick in two fingers, pounds it with a
piercing clatter. The Halgi is used to
