Oggu is a popular folk theatre form
of Andhra Pradesh. Among the
several sub-castes among Yadavas
who devoted themselves to the
singing of ballads in praise of Lord
Siva (Malikarjuna, in native

parlance) and his progeny are the
Kuramas. This community moves
from place to place, narrating the
stories of Mallanna, Beerappa and
Yellamma. Oggus are the traditional
priests of the Yadavas.
Oggukatha got its name because of
the invoking instrument, the Oggu,
used at the beginning of each story
and also at festivals of Mallanna. It

is the folk name given to Sivaâ€™s
damaru. The team consists of four .
to six members: the chief narrator,

an assisting narrator, and at least
two instrumentalists. One of them

plays a big drum called Bheri and
the other brass Talas of a big size.
The chief narrator wears a dhoti, a
coloured shirt, a coloured
headcloth, a coloured waistcloth
and ankle bells. The other narrator

also has the same dress. Oggukatha

allows tremendous scope for
dramatization.
