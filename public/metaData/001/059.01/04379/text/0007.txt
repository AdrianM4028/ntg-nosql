twenty characters in the play,
nearly all of whom are required to
dance, mime, and use stylized
gestures. The characters wear
elaborate costumes and make-up.
The role of Prahlad is usually
played by a young boy.
The play employs the traditional
music of Orissa and a stylized form
of delivery. The Mardala,
harrnoniurn, and a pair of small
cymbals — Gini — are used for
accompaniment. Nrisimha wears a
distinctive mask. Throughout the
play the Gahaka plays an important
role as he acts as the interpreter of
the play besides being the lead
singer. He has specific songs to
sing, verses to recite, and dialogues
to deliver. He sings in praise of the
gods and goddesses, describes
events which are not shown on
stage, and gives prior reference to
events. His dialogue in Sanskritized
Oriya describes situations and
moods of the characters as a
prelude to their song-conversations.
There are a hundred and twenty
songs in the play, each set to a
particular raga and tala. Although
music dominates the play, the songdialogues and the interlinked prosedialogues are equally important.
The play enacts the mythological
story of the devout Prahlad, the
challenge to his faith from his
father Hiranyakashipu, and the
climactic appearance of Vishnu in
his Nrisimha (man-lion) incarnation

to save Prahlad and slay
H iranya kash ipu .

A full performance of Prahlad
Natak takes 12 hours. The
performance is always held in the
open, in the main street of a village
or the precincts of a temple. Before
the performance, all the actors and
musicians gather around the mask

and sing an invocation to Vishnu.
This ritual is not seen by the
spectators; its purpose is to
heighten a shared belief in the
mask’s divinity and power.
