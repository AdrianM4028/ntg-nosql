JAMMU & KASHMIR
National
Bhand
Theatre,
Kashmir

’Bhand’ is the vernacular form of
the classical bhandika, meaning a
clown. Bhand Pather deals with
social realities and makes use of
dance , music, clowning and satire.
It is performed in the village square.
The play is based on a Kashrniri
folk tale of a Gosain (sadhu) and a

rnilkrnaid, Copali, who is attracted
by the Gosain, and starts
participating in his religious
discourses. The Gosain, unaware of
her infatuation, increases his
association with her, taking her
keen interest to be a desire for
spiritual enlightenment. This
contact encourages her, and one
day she expresses her love for him.
She is ready to sacrifice everything,
renounce worldly comforts and
tread upon the difficult path of
ascetics. But the Gosain who has
started the relationship with much
confidence in his asceticisrn finds
himself unable to face her beauty.
At this point, he vanishes.
The play does not end here, for the
dilemma now is how to perform the
Gosain's last rites in the absence of
his body. A situation open to satire
is taken up by the three Vidushakas

with much aplornb. Kashrniri is the
main language of the play.
However, Hindi and Sanskrit
languages are also used.
A musical prelude is sung by four
or five performers after which
humorous anecdotes and
caricatures are presented,
interspersed with singing and
dancing. Pather mirrors social evils:
the cunning rnoneylender, the
dowry system, the corrupt police,
haughty officials. it includes farces
about a sweeper, a peasant, a king,
a barber, a monk. Some plays are
about legendary heroes and gallant
lovers. But it is incisive satire that
characterizes Bhand Pather, giving
relief to people who have led hard
lives under monarchs.
The costume in this form is very
simple. Almost all the characters
wear the typical dress of the
rnendicant — saffron-coloured
loincloth and a sash. They wear
wigs on their heads which are
made of coir. They also carry
trishuls in their hands.
