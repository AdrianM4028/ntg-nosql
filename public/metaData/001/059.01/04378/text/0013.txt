The play moves from the partition of the country to the present-day
communal riots. ‘It probes into religious bigotry by examining the attitudes of
three generations of a middle-class Gujarati business family. Hardika, the
grandmother, is obsessed with her father’s murder during the partition turmoil
and the betrayal by a Muslim friend, Zarine. Her son, Ramnik Gandhi, is haunted
by the knowledge that his fortunes were founded on a shop of Zarine’s father
which was burnt by his own kin. Her daughter-in-law, Aruna, lives by the strict
code of the Hindu sums/emu, and the grand-daughter, Smita, cannot allow

herself a relationship with a Muslim boy. The pulls and counter-pulls of the
family are exposed when two Muslim boys, Babban and Javed, seek shelter in
their house upon being chased by a baying Hindu mob. Babban is a moderate
while Javed is an aggressive youth. After a night-long exchange of judgements
and retorts between the characters, tolerance and forgetfulness emerge as the
only possible solution of the crisis.
