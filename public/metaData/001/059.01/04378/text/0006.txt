Synopsis
Paobirai was a demonic python which devoured men and beasts alike in the
principality of Moirang. Efforts to kill it, both by the king and his subjects. were
in vain. It was decided by the oracle of Lord Thangjing to offer the python a
basketful of rice along with a human being every day. When Chahui Leirong
Panba’s turn came, his mother sent him to Kabui Tomba who helped him to
kill Paobirai as it tried to attack him. Afterwards, the people of Moirang lived in

peace.
