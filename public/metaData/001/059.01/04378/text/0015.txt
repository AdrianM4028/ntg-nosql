bonded labourer.
In desperation, like other tribals, this couple too leaves the village to go to
the city in search of work. Once in the city, they have no other place to live in
but the slum. Frustrated, Mangulu begins to gamble. It is Gurei who works

hard and earns a living. Things get worse when slum dwellers are thrown out
of their homes by politicians. Loans become a regular feature in the lives of
the young couple. Gurei sells her necklace. Mangulu wants to borrow money
from his friends to buy it back. They let him down and this proves to be
_
turning point in his life.
He decides to stop gambling and work hard. With the money earned, he
wants to buy back his wife‘s necklace. Unfortunately, the day he resumes

work, he falls down from a building and dies. Gurei cannot organize the money
to bury the dead body. Ultimately, she is witness to the horrific scene of
wolves devouring her husband‘s corpse.
The play ends on an ironic note with Gurei thinking : “I used to collect
wood in the village and supply it to the nearby town. Now I don‘t even have
enough wood to cremate my dead husband".
