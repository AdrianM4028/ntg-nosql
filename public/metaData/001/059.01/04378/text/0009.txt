gambles a huge chunk of Avan’s salary on matka and loses. Despite her father’s
wheedling, Avan decides to move. As the last of the children abandons home,
a beam crashes, crushing one of the residents of Doongaji House and forcing
the others to vacate the building. Hormusji and Piroja are left at the mercy of
the Parsi Panchayat charity. Hormusji as a person is destroyed; his family
disintegrates; and Doongaji House, a metaphor for a community in a state of
decay, crumbles.
