Director’s Note
Bidesia is the most popular play of Bhikhari
Thakur, which I first directed in 1987. It has
been performed for more than a hundred times.
In this play I have resorted to various customs
and practices of the eastern region as a
theatrical tool. Originally it was a folk song
popular in the Bhojpuri region. In this form of
singing, words like ‘Re Batohiya’, ‘Re Sipahiya’
are repetitively used to create a region specific
rhythmic pattern. I have mixed different folk

forms to create a new one. As a heroine
oriented tale on separation Bidesia holds special
place for me. But still it is not a favorite one
among women. It is popular among only men who developed it. All the

roles. I asked my mother why women who sing all other types of songs do
not have a liking for Bidesia. I was shocked when she replied that Bidesia
is not socially acceptable. The feudal society does not accept its
roughness. I designed the play in a new style, keeping all these elements in
mind. The new form and structure of the play does not conform to the
Bidesia style. Instead of being just Bidesia, it is a search for a new idiom
and a new vision. Bhikhari Thakur has added an original play to the
Indian contemporary theatre and our endeavor is to explore its
possibilities. A three-hour play in the beginning, it has been gradually
reduced to one hour and forty minutes. Come on lets celebrate this.
