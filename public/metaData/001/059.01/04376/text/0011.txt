Iss Kambakhth Sathe Ka Kya Karen (Hindi)
Written by Rajiv Naik
Directed by Sandesh Kulkarni
Presented by Samanvay, Pune
Synopsis

Abhay runs an Advertising Agency, while Salma is a lecturer of English
Literature in a college. They are married to each other and living in
Mumbai.
So far so good. But Abhay has got a chronic problem. He is frustrated
by the success of ‘Mr. Sathe’. Sathe is into film-making and according to
Abhay does not deserve the recognition he has acquired. Abhay keeps on
competing, comparing himself with Sathe and falling short, gets trapped
into a vicious circle of self torturing jealousy.
He is cynical about Sathe’s success and vents his acidic feelings
whenever he is alone with Salma. Talking with Salma is his only outlet.
Salma tries to pacify Abhay sometimes by love, sometimes by setting an
example by her own behaviour. She even steps into a debate, confronts
him, contradicts him and tries to pull him off this slippery path. At times,
she even sets her wishes aside to understand him. Salma who wants to live
a clean and peaceful life wants Abhay
to do the same by accepting his own
limitations and stop cribbing about
them. She also has her own set of
problems but she gets over them and
wants Abhay to do the same.
This play is a dialogue between the
two of them which is humorous and

between two tendencies, between two
ways of living life. In each scene and
also at the end of the play a cycle gets
completed and a new one begins.
Director’s Note

today’s competitive times. There is
bitter cut throat competition around
us which makes even daily survival
difficult. Running in this rat race at
