top gear is really exhausting and leads to cynical jealousy for those who
seem to be ahead of us. The desperate, futile attempts to keep up with the
ongoing pace give birth to defeatist mentality and utter despair. This
despair gives rise to a feeling of insecurity which is clearly reflected in this
play.
There are some materialistic symbols of a
successful person as accepted by the world. To
attain those symbols how low would you step
down?
Would you let your soul be corrupted in this
process?

How are you going to deal with your Sathe?
These are some questions the play asks and
makes you think over.
In this sense the play speaks a lot about
morality. As Salma says in this play, “Certain
things are just not to be done, because they
stick to your soul and stain it permanently”.
The play has references, dialogues, questions, madness and boredom of
the current times. Hence it is a fresh play, a play of our generation.
