Ankiya Nat (Play - Parijat Haran)
Written by Srimanta Sankardev
Presented by Sattriya Akademi, Guwahati
Synopsis

The Krishna drama that originated in the wake of neo-Vaishnavite
movement in the sixteenth century in Assam is known as Ankiya Nat.
The operatic one-act play depicting the Krishna legend, in all its
splendour, is structurally a beautiful synthesis of classical and folk theatre
tradition of the region. Mahapurusha Shankardeva, the great Assamese
Vaishnava saint, and later his followers, wrote lyrical Krishna plays in the
vernacular, mixed with Vrajaboli. These plays are staged even today with
great devotion, in the prayer halls or Narnghars of the Vaishnava
monasteries.
In Ankiya Nat performances two groups of musicians participate. The
vocal music is accompanied on the Mridang (Khol) and cymbals. Various
kinds of masks, distinctive costumes and make-up are used by different
characters. The Sutradhar plays an important role and sings the Nandi in
Sanskrit announcing the subject of the play. The musical compositions,
known as Borgeet, follow the Dhrupad tradition, and the dance
movements have a definite classical tradition.
