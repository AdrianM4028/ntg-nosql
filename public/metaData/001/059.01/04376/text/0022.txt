Krishna Parijat draws its story from the Bhagavata: Narada presents
the heavenly Parijat flower to Krishna. He in turn gives it to Rukmini who
wears it in her hair. Krishna’s other wife, Satyabhama, is jealous and
demands that she should be given one also. Krishna attempts to get it
from the tree which blooms in Indra’s own garden Nandanvan and, when
he is unable to do so, he invades the city of Amaravati. He uproots the
tree after a fierce duel and plants it in Satyabhama’s courtyard, which
makes her proud.
