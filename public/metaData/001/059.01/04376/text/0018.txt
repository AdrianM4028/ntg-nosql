thmd Father (Gosaine Pather)
Presented by National Bhand Theatre
Wathora Chadoora, Kashmir
Synopsis

The performing of the Father focuses on the historical reality that
Kashmir has been the abode of saints, Sadhus, Reshies and sufis, purity of
faith, search for the ultimate reality and universal brotherhood has been
the dominant scence over the centuries. The Pather also ridicules those
people who use religion to meet their nefarious design and do not hesitate
to deceive the honest and pious being. This play is based on a Kashmiri
folk tale of a Gosaine (Sadhu) and a milkmaid-gopali, who is attracted by
the Gosaine, and starts participating in his religious discourses. The
Gosaine, unaware of her infatuation, increases his association with her,

taking her keen interest to be a desire for spiritual enlightenment. This
contact encourages her and one day she expresses her love for him. She is
ready to sacrifice everything, renounce worldly comforts and tread upon
the difficult path of the ascetics. But the Gosaine who has stared the
relationship with a tremendous amount of confidence in his asceticism
finds himself unable to face her beauty. At this point, he vanishes.
