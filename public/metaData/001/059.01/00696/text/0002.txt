Unlike other plays basically woman oriented, BAH U is
the story of a young woman who having led a totally
meaningless relationship with her husband, is as a
young widow, desirous of achieving fulfilment in life.
She wishes to assert her right of self realization: to be
a co-sharer in her husband's family and to establish
her right as an individual. To her moral codes and their
social overtones are of little significance, and instead
of succumbing to her widowed status stoically,
she reacts as a flesh and blood character—a woman
who wants to love and be loved, to achieve motherhood
and offer her child and herself a fair opportunity
of rehabilitation.

In her earlier attempts to fit within the conventional

frame work of her husband’s conservative family,
she is faced with the utter futility of the system of
decadent values. She eventually breaks away from the
family, seeking a satisfactory refuge fer herself and
her child away from the stifling atmosphere.
The play is being staged for the first time by a
professional repertory, and some of the script has been
edited and evolved during readings with the cast
and the playwright.
