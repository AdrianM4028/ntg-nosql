storm the Castle Barracks. ln retaliation the
Khyber opens fire and battle begins all along
the Bombay coast. The Congress leader
Maganlal Jajodia condemns the violence and
appeals for peace.

British troops terrorize the slum-dwellers —
participants in the Khyber’s struggle — but
they retaliate with arms from the ship cached
by Krishnabai. Gunner Shardul Singh’s
mother. Desperate British officers confer with
the Congress leader and with Saxena who
eventually reveals the source of the arms.
The slum is raided but the cache has already
been removed. Krishnabai and the father of
another Khyber sailor are taken hostages.
Maganlal Jajodia and Saxena board the ship
to persuade the sailors to surrender but they
refuse toyther with the sailors of five other
ships. Jajodia tells the sailors that Shardul
Singh’s mother would be shot if they did not
relent. Overriding Shardul’s objection to any
compromise, the sailors agree to meet Rear
Admiral Rattray. Contrary to commitments
made by the British, Shardul and two other
sailors are arrested at the meeting. On the
assurance that Shardul’s life would be spared,
Shardul’s wife Laxrnibai is persuaded to
reveal the location of the arms. Shardul is
killed, however, and the sailors of the Khyber
are attacked by Royal Air Force
Spitfires.

About the Play
Ka/lol, a Little Theatre Group production,
opened at Minerva Theatre, Calcutta, on 29
March 1965 and ran for 850 shows. The play
was a sensation in the city and produced
violent reactions, both for and against. Utpal
Dutt was jailed for it without trial and the
theatre was attacked several times. For some
time most newspapers refused to carry
advertisements of the play, but people in
general publicized it widely with hand-written
posters — not only in Calcutta, but in the
countryside around. To mark its 800th
performance, a public meeting was held on
the Calcutta Maidan, attended by a million
people. In the history of political theatre in the

country, Kal/o/ remains an important event.
