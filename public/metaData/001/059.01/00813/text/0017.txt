Director’s Note
The Indian People’s Theatre Association '
staged Nabanna in Calcutta in 1944, an event
that marked the start of a new theatre
movement in Bengal and brought forth a new
generation of actors, directors, and writers.
The Quit India movement of 1942, the floods
that year, the famine of 1943, the starvation
deaths on the streets of Calcutta are the
backdrop to this play. It is not a play about a
single family, but fragments of life presented
in an epic manner. Sombhu Mitra, who
directed the IPTA production together with
playwright Bijon Bhattacharya, said in an
interview: “The pain and tears of the time
were vividly captured by the play. It is
episodic and each episode touched the
individual, the society, the nation,
the country . "
The present production does not intend to
recreate the past; it attempts an analysis of
those epoch-making events from a
contemporary perspective.
