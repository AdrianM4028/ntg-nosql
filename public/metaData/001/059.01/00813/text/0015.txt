to rebel. The blood report reveals nothing, but
the blood in the bowl, reflecting his own face,
frightens the Baja Sahib. He flings away the
bowl, but the blood crawls out and pursues
him all the way.

Director’s Note
The play is about authority and power which
exploit with ever-changing faces and the
rebellion of the youth against this tyranny.
Though we have any number of plays on this
subject, the uniqueness and power of Guinea
Pig lie in the extremely dramatic and poetic
treatment of the theme. In each dramatic
situation, the abstraction is always underlined.
