He
down his request. Finally he goes to the poet
Nazir who promptly obliges him. He returns
singing Nazir’s song about cucumbers and
customers flock for his product. Other
vendors — the Ladduwala, the Tarboozwala,
etc. — follow suit and soon the whole bazar is
humming with Nazir‘s songs.
Around this main plot is woven the story of
a young vagabond who pursues a courtesan
and comes to a sticky end at the hands of his
rival, a police inspector, whom he had earlier
shamed in this game of love.

Director’s Note
The play is woven around Nazir Akbarabadi‘s
humanistic poetry and humanism is the
theme of the play. Nazir. a truly proletarian
poet, often wrote on demand for vendors and
traders. beggars and vagabonds, never caring
to collect or publish what he wrote. His
colloquialism and slang cut him off from the
mainstream of Urdu poetry; his work was
‘discovered’ generations after his death by a
chance encounter of a literary man who was
attracted by a beggar’s song. Some material
was recovered from Nazir’s granddaughter
and published in book form, though much of
the total corpus is now lost.
Nazirlnever appears in Agra Bazar as no
authentic account of his life is available. All

we know is that the poet earned a rnodesl
“mg by giving tuitions to young children,
refusmg invitations and commissions from
well—wishers like the Nawab of Lucknow.
