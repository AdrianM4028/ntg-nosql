texts they had in many ca ses discovered and helped to
establish as classics? Will a director attempt an approximation
of his earlier interpretation or will he approach the play as
though it were an altogether new text? Will the plays, some of
which survive only as texts for academic study, stimulate
today’s viewers as they did their original audiences? ‘
The experiment is unusual: the risk considerable. So we are
happy most of the directors and playwrights we approached
agreed to share the risk with us and the new audiences. When
३ artists of the stature of Utpa/ Dutt and Habib Tan vir (the most
senior directors in this festival) and Ra tan .Thiyam (the
youngest) come forward one does not hesitate.

There were constraints. The participation had to be limited
for obvious reasons to one play or production per person. In a
couple of cases, the directors could not get their first choice,
although in most cases they are presenting plays they had
presented before on their own. There are regrets: Badal Sircar
did not wish his Eva m l n d raj it to be staged in Hindi. Missing
from the cast lists are also some of the well known actors and
actresses whose careers are closely linked with the
development of our theatre for one reason or another.
This is only to say the selection has some lacunae, as
every selection will ha ve. But most of the playwrights and all the
directors participating have been honoured with a Sangeet
Natak A kaderni A ward.
if the Samaroh succeeds — and given that nothing of this
kind has been tried anywhere before the criteria of success can
only emerge as the Samaroh progresses — we hope to host
more in future years, so the richest moments of our theatre
heritage can be brought alive again for a later generation to the
extent it is possible to do such a thing in a med/urn as intense
