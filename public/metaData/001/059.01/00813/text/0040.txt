B a c kg ro u n d
Ghashiram Kotwa/ — a blend of historical fact
and dramatic fiction — is set in 18th—century

Pune, capital of the dying Maratha empire.
* Pune was then dominated by the Brahmins, a
small community of intellectuals and priests.
Nana Phadnavis, the Chancellor, ran the
empire while the Peshwa, the hereditary
Prime Minister, was only a figurehead. Intrigue
and decadence eroded the foundations of the
empire which, within a few years from the
setting of the story, passed into vassalage
under the British.
