CHORUS REPERTORY THEATRE, IMPHAL

Syn 0 ps I s
The Kurukshetra war is on. In the Kaurava
camp Duryodhana and others accuse Guru
Dronacharya of leniency towards the
Pandavas. They ask him to prove his loyalty
by creating a chakravyuha, the cosmic
military formation. Dronacharya agrees to
create the chakravyuha, using seven
charioteers. The Pandavas are worried; for
the secret of penetrating a chakravyuha is
known only to Arjuna, who is engaged in
battle elsewhere.

Rafa/7 Th/yam

Arjuna’s 16-year—old son Abhimanyu says
he knows how to break into the formation. In
the course of a conversation Arjuna had
revealed this secret to his wife Subhadra.
Abhimanyu, then in Subhadra’s womb, learnt
how to penetrate the vyuha, but as Subhadra
fell asleep midway through the conversation,
he did not know how to come out of it.
Yudhishthir asks Abhimanyu to break into the
Kauravas’ chakravyuha and promises to help
him come out by sending reinforcements.

On the 13th day of the battle Abhimanyu,
having entered the formation, is killed as no
reinforcements reach him and the Kauravas
use foul methods. How truthful was
Yudhishthir? Was Abhimanyu’s death
necessary or was he a sacrificial goat?

Director’s Note
The play evolved during a workshop with
actors -— the first phase of my project on
acting methodology — where the text of the
Mahabharata was studied in great detail. The
actors went through a training programme in
traditional forms and martial arts of Manipur to
acquire the requisite flexibility of body and
voice. They were also involved in designing
masks. costumes and properties.
