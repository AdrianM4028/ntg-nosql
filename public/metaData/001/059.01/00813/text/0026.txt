disturbs Devadatta profoundly. In anguish
Devadatta cuts off his head at the temple of
goddess Kali. Overwhelmed by guilt and
sorrow Kapila too kills himself. Before Padrnini
can follow suit, the goddess gives her a boon
to bring back Kapila and Devadatta to life. In
blind haste, Padmini transposes the wrong
heads on the bodies. She goes with
Devadatta who has Kapila’s body.
Padrnini gives birth to a son. Gradually the
. strong body supporting Devadatta’s head
assumes its earlier softer contours and
Devadatta himself seems to have lost his
former flair for scholarship and poetry. This
upsets Padmini.
She persuades Devadatta to go to Ujjain
and buy new dolls for their child. She herself
goes with the child to Kapila in the forest.
Devadatta suspects Padmini’s intentions
when he finds her missing on return. He
follows her to the forest where Kapila and
Devadatta meet in a duel and kill each other.
Padrnini commits Sati.
Padmini’s orphaned child grows up in the
forest and later comes to the civilized world.
The mute boy laughs as he rides
Hayavadana. Hayavadana. who had a human

voice till then, acquires the neigh of a horse.
