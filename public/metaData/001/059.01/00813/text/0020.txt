Bhasa
Bhasa is among the earliest Sanskrit
playwrights and is believed to have been a
forerunner of Kalidasa. Before the discovery
of 13 of his plays from a village near
Trivandrum by the Sanskrit scholar T
Ganapathi Sastri in 1912, only
Swapnavasavadattarn was known as a Bhasa
play. However, scenes from the other plays,
unknown to the outside world till then, were
always enacted in the form of Koodiyattam by
the Chakyars of Kerala. Urubhangam is one
of Bhasa’s major works and, along with
Karnab—haram, exemplifies the Indian concept
of tragic drama.
