Director’s Note
The play is about the disintegration of a
middle-class family and the conflict between
man and woman. It has continued to allure
and fascinate me since the time I first
produced it in 1970. I had to settle for Savitri
as the protagonist and the man-woman
relationship as the subject matter. Within
these main strands are woven many patterns
and a Chiaroscuro of contemporary life.

Shyamanand Jalan
Born in 1934, Shyamanand Jalan has for long
years served the Hindi theatre in Calcutta. He
has directed 33 plays and acted in 25. Some
of his representative productions are Eva/n
Indraj/‘t, Hazar Chauras/ ki Ma, and Kanyadan,
besides all the major plays of Mohan Rakesh.
Shyamanand Jalan has also acted in films by
Utpalendu Chakraborty, Shyam Benegal and
Mrinal Sen. He received the Sangeet Natak
Akademi Award for direction in 1972.

Mohan Rakesh
Born in 1925, Mohan Rakesh is regarded as a
dramatist who gave Hindi drama its modern
face, and enriched its stage character and
language. His major plays are Ashadh ka ek
Din, Lehron ke Rajhans, and A dhe A dhure.
Adhe Adhure had an euphoric reception
when first produced and has been
commended in Hindi criticism as a powerful
representation of middle-class family life.
Mohan Rakesh’s other works include several
collections of short stories — including Insan
ke Khandhar and Naiye Bada/ — and novels
including And/tare Band Kamr'e. When he
died in 1972, Mohan Rakesh was engaged in
research on the dramatic word as a
Jawaharlal Nehru fellow. He was
.
awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award
for playwriting in 1968.
