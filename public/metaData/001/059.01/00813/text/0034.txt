A translation of Adya Rangacharya’s Ke/u
Janme/aya, the play has six symbolic
characters: Neta, Buddha, Yuvak, Yuvati,
Mamuli Ram — and the Sutradhar
representing the dramatist’s point of view. In
the first act, Buddha boasts of his long
experience on earth, while Yuvak declares
that results are achieved only by energy and
enthusiasm; desire is the basis of man’s
progress, asserts Yuvati. while Marnuli Ram
believes in work and action.

At the office of Nava Samaj Nirrnan Kendra,
the Neta’s creation, these characters —- now
set in a social context —- reappear as
employees in the second act. The result of
the ensuing conflict of ideas is seen in the
Suno Janmeiaya - a rehearsal photograph
