Savitri is the breadwinner of her family. Her
husband Mahendranath and son Ashok are
unemployed. Her elder daughter Binny elopes
with one of Savitri’s friends, and the younger
daughter Kinny is impudent and rebellious.
After a serious altercation, Mahendranath
goes to live with his friend. Savitri pleads with
her boss to give a job to her son but Ashok,
who hates everything about Savitri, refuses to
accept it. The frustration of supporting a
hostile family d'rives Savitri to an old admirer.
The man. however, refuses to get involved. A
defeated Salvitri returns home to find Juneja, a
friend of Mahertdranath’s, waiting for her.
