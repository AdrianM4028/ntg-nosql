Sangeet Natak Akademi — the National Academy of Music, Dance and

Drama — was founded in 1953 for the furtherance of the performing arts
of India, a task in which it cooperates with counterparts in the States
and voluntary organizations all over the country. Through sponsorship,
research and dissemination it seeks an enhanced public appreciation of
music, dance and drama, together with a quickened exchange of ideas
and techniques for the common gain of Indian performing arts.
