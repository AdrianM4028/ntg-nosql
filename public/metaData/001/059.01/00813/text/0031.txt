Syn 0 ps I s
Shridhar Vishwanath Kulkarni, a professor,
faces an enquiry by the university authorities
for his links with leftist politics. He is accused,
among other things, of contesting an election
against his Gandhian father, writing radical
plays, and spreading leftist ideas on the
campus. Manoeuvering his way through the
maze of accusations, Kulkarni attempts to
unfold the complex nature of his relationships
with people and politics. His narration of key
events in his life reveals — in flashbacks —
the deep respect he has for his father despite
political differences, his relationship with his
wife Saraswati — a communist party member
who sees his independence in thought and
action as a threat to her rise in the party —
and with the actress Madhavi who brought his
plays to life but imposed conditions that made
their relationship impossible. The committee
reads into his part non-commital, part
tangential, and sometimes passionater
reasoned answers the evidence it is looking
for. He is told that he would have to pay the
price for living according to his convictions. In
the end Kulkarni faces his son who, like the
father, has begun to lose what he would like
to keep because of his habit of seeing
situations from all angles. Thus begins
another cycle of hope and disillusionment.

Uddhwasfa Dharmasha/a uses a rich and
poetic Marathi, and good delivery of its taut
dialogue calls for hard work on the part of
actors, who must also comprehend the sociopolitical backdrop to the play. These demands
