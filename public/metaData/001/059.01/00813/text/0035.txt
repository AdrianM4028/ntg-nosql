last act which shows Marnuli Ram happily
married to Yuvati. Yuvak feels betrayed by
Buddha who wasted the best part of Yuvak’s
life by clinging to his post. The old man dies
and Yuvak, Yuvati and Marnuli Ram follow
suit, leaving the Neta behind.
Neta thinks the play is boring and
incomprehensible. The Sutradhar tells him: “It
is better to live in death than be dead while
living”.

Marnuli Ram

Director’s Note
The play is a scathing commentary on our
present~day situation — the myopic
leadership and the incompetent bureaucracy.
The consistent behaviour of the Sutradhar
shows up against the inconsistency of the
Neta. There is little structural link between the
scenes, no plot or growth in the play. This is
also true of the symbolic characters.
Stylization in acting, sets, costumes, and
lighting has thus been attempted to match the
playwright’s conception.
