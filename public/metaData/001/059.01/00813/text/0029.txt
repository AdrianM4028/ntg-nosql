and he himself would die at the hands of an
ordinary hunter. Yudhishthir, on the other
hand, is haunted by the horrors of war and
disilldsioned with victory. The changing ideals
of the rulers leave the common man
unaffected. The play ends with the death of
Lord Krishna and a new realization dawning
on Ashwattharna.

About the Play
Mahabharata tells the story of a family of
warrior kings whose descendants, the
Kauravas and the Pandavas, waged a bitter
war for power and supremacy. The war
represents a conflict between the principles
of dharma and adharrna. The Pandavas
(dharma) triumphed over the Kauravas
(adharma) with the aid and guidance of Lord
Khshna.

The playwright has interpreted this great
war in a new light, giving it a universal
meaning. Against the backdrOp of death and
destruction, the concepts of right and wrong,
truth and justice, chaos and order are
reexamined, as is manâ€™s place in the
universe. The Pandavas are no less
responsible for the degeneration of moral
values. Lord Krishna, the great teacher, is as
prone to hUman weaknesses as the bestial
Ashwattharna. It is the story of lost souls
caught in the web of their weakness. It is also
the story of their self-exploration and quest for
enlightenment. It is this very self-questioning

This great war between the Kauravas and
Pandavas was fought for 18 days. Each day,
sons and generals of Dhritarashtra, the blind
king of the Kauravas, were killed. The
accepted codes were broken one by one,
resulting in the degeneration of morals on
both sides.
