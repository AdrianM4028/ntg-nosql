Ghashirarn, a penniless Brahrnin from north
lndia, voyages to Pune in search of his
fortune. Hungry, he tries to attend a feast for
Brahrnins but is harshly refused entrance.
Later he is accused of stealing and thrown
into prison. Eventually an embittered
Ghashirarn is released; humiliated and
abused, he swears vengeance on the
Brahrnins.

When his opportunity arises, Ghashirarn
seizes it, using his lovely young daughter
Lalitagauri. Ghashiram presents her to Nana
Phadnavis in return for the prestigious
Kotwali, office of Chief of Police. In this
position Ghashirarn unleashes a reign of
terror, full of ruthless and arbitrary injustice.
With the support of Nana behind him
Ghashirarn fills the prisons while all Pune
trembles.

Later Nana, tired of Gauri, marries again for
the seventh time. Ghashirarn seeks his
dishonoured daughter only to find that she
has died unwed in childbirth. Furious, he
confronts Nana but is cowed down by the
Chancellor’s authoritative manner and quietly
agrees to preserve silence.
Eventually the bloodthirsty Ghashirarn
irnprisons Brahrnins for a petty crime in an
overcrowded cell where they die of
suffocation. An enraged mob demands
Ghashirarn’s death. and Nana willingly agrees
to dispose of the monster he created. Life
continues.

Playwright’s Note
Ghashirarn is not a historical play. It is a story,
in prose, verse, music and dance, set in a
historical era. Ghashirarns are creations of
socio-political forces, which know no barriers
of time and place. Although based on a
historical legend, l have no intention of
commenting on the morals, or lack of them, of
the Peshwa, Nana Phadnavis, or Ghashirarn.
The moral of the story, if there is any, may be
looked for elsewhere.
