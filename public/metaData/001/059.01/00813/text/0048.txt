jewellery. Sudheer brings her back from
Bombay but the tutor has disappeared with
the jewellery. With the bone of contention
removed, the family rediscovers its old bonds.
A portion of the house is sold and the 'new
owner intends to Open a saw-mill there. The
funeral is over, and Anjali and Sudheer bid
farewell. Would they ever return?

Director’s Note
The play has an emotional, Chekhovian,
rhythm. It narrates the experience of a
generation which lived in the joint family. We
are a part of that generation but our children
are not. The bonds of the joint family are
breaking down, and we feel sorry for that. All
this is there in the play with a lot of conviction
and inevitability. To bring out the arnbience of
the ancestral home and to strike the right
rhythm, l have used the visual element —
lighting, particularly — and a cross-sectional
set which was designed after visits to Mahesh
Elkunchwar's own family home and the house
where my film Smriti Chit/"e was shot.
