ancestral home, the joint family of the
Deshpandes of Dharangaon. On the death of
the paterfamilias, Tatyajee, Sudheer, his
second son, arrives at Dharangaon from
Bombay together with his 'wife Anjali. They

Sudheer’s mother Aai feels the loss of
Tatyajee while Sudheer’s sister Prabha is
bitter as she now has to depend on her
brothers’ generosity.

Sudheer’s elder brother Bhaskar and his
wife Vahini indirectly suggest that Sudheer

Sudheer to take him to Bombay. Bhaskar’s

settled. Vahini too asks Bhaskar to divide the
property to avoid any more embarrassing
situations.
