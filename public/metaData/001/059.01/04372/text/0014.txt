back. The string is looped around the
puppeteer’s ﬁngers and movements
are generated by a series of jerks at
either end. Dancing girls are special
kat/qutlis — they have four strings
and their limbs are sewn in such a
manner that several movements can
be produced. Ita/qutlz' is the only
string puppet, which does not have a
device or control for manipulation.
The puppeteer often irnprovises
on the narrative to hold the attention
of his audience while his witty
comments enliven the performance.
He speaks for the puppet characters
in a squeaky voice with a bamboo
whistle, known as [70/11 A unique
‘puppet language’ is thereby created.
The puppeteer converses with the
puppets, to enable the audience to
follow the course of the narrative.
This ‘dialogue’ is cleverly coordinated
with songs sung by the women of
the family to the accompaniment of
the d/aolak, which provides further
narrative and dialogue.
Most Kathputlis are manipulated
with only one string, one end of
which is tied to the Kathputli’s head
and other to its back. The string is
looped around the puppeteer’s fingers
and all movements are generated by
series of jerks on either end.
Ghungrus are worn by the puppeteer
on his wrists. The dancing girls are
special Kathputlis as they have four
strings and their limbs are sewn in
such a manner that several
movements can be produced with
the slightest pull. Their necks swivel
on a joint, and so several neck
movements are possible.
THE GROUP
Founded in 1991, Aakar is directed
by Puran Bhatt, based in Kathputli
Colony, Shadipur Depot, Delhi. The
group has performed in schools, at

Pragati Maidan for the Literacy
Mission, and for the Ministry of

Environment. It has also presented
programmes for television. Using
traditional rod, string and shadow
puppets, Aakar also presents themes
which deal with social awareness
issues, such as HIV/AIDS, family
planning and programmes for
mentally challenged children through
traditional storytelling.

Puran Bhatt incorporates elements
such as black theatre and mask drama

in this new production. Over the
past twenty years, Puran Bhatt has
travelled to and worked in Europe
and North America as part of the
19805 series of Festivals of India held
in various world capitals. He was also

an artist—participant in the Silk Route
exhibition held at Smithsonian
५
Institution in Washington D.C

Puran Bhatt has held Kathputli
puppet—making and manipulation
workshops in Delhi, Rajasthan and
abroad. He is also an awardee of
Sangeet Natak Akaderni.

Puran Bhatt
I’uran Bhatt is a traditional Kathputli
puppeteer and a master of
manipulation and puppet—making. In
the 19805, he was a member of the
Shri Ram Centre Puppet Repertory
where, under the directorship of
Dadi D. I’udumjee, traditional and
modern puppeteers collaborated on
new productions. Puran Bhatt has
brought to his Kathputli art the
techniques and narrative styles he
absorbed through his close
collaboration with Pudumjee. While
D/yola Mam is essentially a
‘traditional’ Kathputli performance,
(although the story is not one of the
set Kathputli pieces), there is a

development of storyline and
characterization in this production
that is often lacking in the vestiges of
the Rajasthani Kathputli tradition
seen today. One of I’uran Bhatt’s
contemporary puppet productions,
Carl/amt, explores the legendary
history of the Kathputli performers.
