G. Venu

In 1981, when Pavakathakali was
near extinction, G. Venu through his
Natanakairali Centre was determined
to revive the art form. Sangeet Natak

Akademi granted the initial financial
assistance for a training programme

on the art. Under G. Venu’s

guidance, a group of artists was
chosen and given training in music,

THE GROUP
The Pavakathakali group,
Natanakairali was established in 1981
to revive the art of traditional Kerala
glove puppetry. It is comprised of
traditional puppeteers and artists
newly trained in the form by the
Natanakairali institute. The group
was invited to participate in the XIth
International Puppet Theatre Festival
held in Poland in 1984 and at the
Puppet Carnival held in Japan in
1986. In 1987 the group presented

manipulation and puppet—making at
Natanakairali. Over the past twenty
years, Gopal Venu and Natanakairali
have brought Pavakathakali to the
forefront of traditional Indian

Puppetry
