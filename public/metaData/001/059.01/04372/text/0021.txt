The few families of puppeteers,

who speak a mix ofTelugu and
Malayalam, appear to have migrated
from Andhra I’radesh. The
puppeteers are from the Andi

Pandaram community and are
devotees of Subramania. They make a
living by performing pujas for other
devotees and organizing pilgrirnages

to the Subramanian shrine at Palani.
The puppeteers present puppet
shows when free from performing
Pujas.

The Pava/eat/yakali puppeteers
have adapted the atta/eat/aas (dance
stories) of Ita/yakalz'. The episodes are

usually drawn from the Mahabharata
like Iszanasaugand/az'kam,
Uttaraswayamz/aram and
Duryod/aanavaa’bam. They follow the
conventions of Kat/yakalz' character
types in respect to costumes,
headgear, jewellery and make—up of
their puppets. While manipulating
the glove puppets, the puppeteers
provide the eloquent and dramatic
facial expressions to the puppets, by
magical transference, as it were.

The musical instruments, the
Mazda (drum), ckengila (gong),
z'latkalam (cymbals) and shank/7 are
also the same as in Kathakali

The glove puppets are between
30 and 60 centimetres high, with
heads and arms carved out of wood.

While the head is manipulated by
the index ﬁnger, the arms are moved

by the thumb and middle ﬁnger. In
earlier times, the puppets were smaller
and therefore more easily manipu—
lated.

Pavakathakali is performed with
no curtain or screen to hide the

puppeteers from the audience.
I’avakat/Ja/ealz' flourished until

about forty years ago, when, with the
passing away of some ﬁne and

popular artistes, the form was on the
verge of extinction. Successful
attempts have been made since,

however, to revive the tradition.
