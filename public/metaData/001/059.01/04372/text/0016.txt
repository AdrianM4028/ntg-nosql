SYNOPSIS OF THE PLAY
The performance begins with the
Aa’ya Kanda episode of the
Ramayana, with the birth and

childhood of the four brothers Rama,
Lakshmana, Bharata and
Shatrughana, and concludes in
Rama’s marriage to Sita. The Ayodhya

Kaikeyi, the banishment of Rama,
Sita and Lakshmana from Ayodhya
and their encounter with Srupnakha.
In the Army/aka Kana’a Maricha

disguised as a golden deer tempts
Sita, eventually Sita steps out of the
Lakshmana Rekha and Ravana
abducts her.

is believed that Rama, a divine and
an illuminated being, does not cast a

shadow. Ravana is a strongly etched
puppet character in the performance,
that follows the Oriya version called
Vic/Jam Ramayana by Vishvanath
Khuntia, a seventeenth—century poet.

Ravanac/a/Jaya is also known as
Ramalila or Ramanataka.
Ravanachhaya was popular all
across the Anugul and Dhenkanal
districts of Orissa in the late
nineteenth century, but is now
practised only in the Odasa region of
Anugul district. The performers are
from the Bhat community, whose
ancestors were musicians and officers
in the royal courts.

no joints, their size varying from less
then 20 centimetres to over 60
centimetres.
Compositions on screen are

devised imaginatively with
mountains, animals, rows of trees,
nagpasha, palanquins, chariots and
other special sceneries and settings.
The dark silhouette, delicately
outlined, is defined by very few
incisions for clothing and jewellery.
The same character may be shown in
different stances and in varying sizes,
to show, say, Hanuman flying into
the distance.
A square enclosure is made of
bamboo poles with a stretched white
dhoti as the screen and straw mats to
screen off the lower area. The
puppets are arranged in their order of
appearance before the performance.
Prayers are offered for a successful
performance by breaking a coconut
and the ritual lighting of the wicks of
two earthen oil lamps on bamboo
