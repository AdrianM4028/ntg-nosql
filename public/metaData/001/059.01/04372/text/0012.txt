The ritually set up stage is made
with jute cloth tied to bamboo poles
on three sides, and the lower area is
covered with black cloth. The
dimensions of the white cloth screen
in front is up to 3 X 2.4 metres, and .
is tilted towards the audience from

the top as it balances the large
puppets. The puppets are
manipulated from behind the screen,

and by striking puppets against each
other as in battle scenes.

The singers are accompanied by
the mridangam, harrnonium and two
to three pairs of mlam.
