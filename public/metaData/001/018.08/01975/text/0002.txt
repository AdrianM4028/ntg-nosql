The selected poems in this montage of contemporary Punjabi poetry,
explore various dimensions of the human tragedy that has gripped us for

over a decade.

They present a kaleidoscopic insight to agony, anguish and

pain of our times and the times to come.

Our collective consciousness has

to learn many lessons from the past to safeguard our future.

The present

experiment of theatrical expression of poetry is an attempt in this direction.
