. “Lash Ghuirya lauk”
(Divert the Corpse!)
Script

& Direction—Bijan Bhattacharya

THIS PLAY depicts a tragic episode in the background of the communal problem
at one of its tensest moments. There can be no freedom or happiness for the mind
of man until this virulent poison of communalism is removed. As long as it is allowed to

work the democratic conscience will ﬁnd itself baffled again and again.
Dr. Suren, an idealist, kills an innocent man, mistaking him for an assailant.
He is so overborne by his sense of guilt at having taken a life that he ﬁnally opts
for suicide in order to resolve his mental conflict. But he did not know that the
man he has slain was his own son who had risked all danger to his life in an

effort to stop communal rioting.

Unaware of the other tragedy, the people of the

locality decide that the martyr’s corpse must not be shown to the doctor.
lighted procession accompanying the martyr’s bier

is diverted

to

so that the doctor should not see the corpse’s face.
