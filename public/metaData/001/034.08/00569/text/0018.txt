(When the Goddess Roared)

& Direction—Bijan Bhattacharya

IN BIRBHUM, a border district of West Bengal, live Adivasi tribes—Bauris and

Santhals—ancient settlers on the red soil of the district. This play attempts to depict
their miserable life under the f‘eudalistic_ land system: they belong to the soil but
the soil does not belong to them. Their aspirations for right to the land are never
realised. At times they rise in desperate revolt, but these are smashed by the combined forces of the vested interests. One of the latter, Prabhanjan, is a crooked
and cunning man who foiled the objectives of the law abolishing zamindaris and
setting a ceiling on land by parcelling

and hirelings.

He unleashed a

his vast landed estate among his own men

reign of terror among the tillers and denied them,

in a time of scarcity, any share of the d/zarmgola, stocked with
their own contri-

butions in the previous year of good harvest. As a result, some people died of
starvation. Moreover, he abducted and raped the young wife of a tenant to
satisfy
his lust. At last the people rose in revolt under the leadership of a group named
Bohurupee ; they confronted the evil-doing Prabhanjan, removed the panchayet dominated by that man and, through a new, pOpularly elected panchayat,
established the
tiller’s right to the land. The people set up a court for trying Prabhanjan
; ﬁnally
he met his retribution in the hands of the husband of the woman whom he
had
raped and who had died as the result of the brutal outrage.
