“Garhhavah Iananl

(The Fecund Mother)
by Calcutta Theatre

Script & Direction—Bijan Bhattacharjya.

Synopsis :

THE STORY revolves round the life of the aboriginal settlers in the tidal lowlands
of Bengal—their primitive

rituals

and their strange beliefs

and

customs.

To

them

everything in life from birth to death is governed by an underlying belief in the
Mother cult. The prime Mother is the earth, and she is the fecund mother from whom

life draws its

origin and

sustenance.

A

child is born

innumerable charms, arnulets and spells to ward oﬂ“

and

grows protected by

supernatural evils. 'A man or a

woman dies and the soul is speeded to its home by ritualistic ceremonies.
spirits and their ﬁve main deities crowd the trees.

Departed

Through this tangle of beliefs and

superstitions runs their fundamental belief in the prime deity—Mother Earth, reproducing all life, physical and human. It is a simple and Virile belief, yet it is
obscured by the clever machinations of their Chief Medicine Man. Nevertheless they
are children of the Mother, whom they love blindly and uncomprehendingly.
