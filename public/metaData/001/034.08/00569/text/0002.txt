FCI’S LEAPING TARGET IN THE 70’s
The FCl has set up all-time targets to produce fertilizers during

the new decade.

This is being done in two ways—“expanding

existing fertilizer plants and adding new ones

At the Namrup Fertilizer Plant, for instance, a major expansion
project will increase the annual production of 45,000 tonnes to
2,00,000 tonnes in terms of Nitrogen.

New plants are coming up at Durgapur and Barauni each with a
production capacity of 1,52,000 tonnes of nitrogen.
During 1970’s when all the plants are completed the total production of fertilizers will rise to 20,00,000 tonnes of nitrogen and
4,00,000 tonnes of phosphates.
