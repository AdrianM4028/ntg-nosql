TODAy's BENGAL
G0 vinda Chakra varii

SERIOUS is my country’s malady

Today. An uneasiness grim
Is screwing her coil by coil.
In the gathering gloom, cogged to the chin,
Bengal, she calls drowning... . drowning .....
Piercing the horiZOn far.

Yonder by the banks of rivers,
And across the ﬁelds and wilderness vast
Listen to her cry I

O, Bengal’s in the grip of a crisis today !
With clangs incessant, one after another,

The doors infernal turn on their hinges.
Trampling and stamping the days of sirish
And palas gay,

Out rush the frankensteins in dreadful array.
Dark visages ! black hands ! with guffaws loud
Scatter they the flames of fear.
And our mother fair,
Like a creeper severed,
Is rolling on the cremation ground, dismal.

THERE’S virus abroad; the air is choking ;
Yet quite a few, I see, charmingly beaming :
Clever, cautious, cunning—
Fishing in the troubled waters.

The sea’s astir :
It is the genuine Spring in Bengal today.

For the ﬁrst time, they say,
The free winds are blowing in the land,
The ﬁrst batch of bees are on their wings ;
And Life, too, for the ﬁrst time, ﬁnds its stature true. _
