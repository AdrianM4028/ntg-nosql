Tagore’s Dance Drama

‘ ‘ C hilran ga(13 ”
Production : Lokranjan Unit, West Bengal.

Synopsis :
The story of “Chitrangada”, taken from an episode of the great epic “Mahabharat”, is well known to all Indians.

The king of Manipur had received blessings from Lord Shiva to the effect that
he would have sons only in his family. Yet by a freak of fortune when Chitrangada,

a girl was born, the king accepted her as a son and brought her up in that manner.
The drama begins when Chitrangada, attired like a man, goes for hunting and

comes across Arjuna, the third Pandava, asleep ~ in the woods.
panions try to worry Arjuna out of the way.

Chitrangada’s com.

But Arjuna simply laughs at

and goes away without taking any notice of Chitrangada.

The slight and

them

humilia-

tion received from Arjuna suddenly arouse the woman in Chitrangada and, in deep
love with Arjuna, she longs to seek fulﬁlment in union with the great warrior.
But Arjuna, under a penance in fulﬁlment of his vow

at that

time, had to

refuse her. In desperation, Chitrangada prays to Anangadeva, the God of Love.
Her prayers bear fruit and she is bestowed with heavenly charm and beauty to captivate Arjuna’s heart. The God of Love has his way.

But in no time Chitrangada realises that Arjuna has surrendered to something
unreal, untrue. Arjuna also has the same feeling of disillusionment and thinks of
coming out of the spell.

in repentance, Chitraganda returns her borrowed beauty to the God of Love
and justiﬁes her womanhood. She prays to get back the true woman
within herself
in order to stand by her beloved in all the joys and sorrows of life.
Her prayer is granted and both, in true bondage of love, ﬁnd a real
partner
of life in each other.
