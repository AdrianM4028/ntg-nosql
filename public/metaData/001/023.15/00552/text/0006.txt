THE STORY

The pathetic philosophy of Self

conten~

ment a make-belief
realitykindolence
and sloth permeat the atmosphere in every
phase of our life and activity.
But the foundation of this make-belief
reality is fragile because it is impossible for
us to dissociate overselves from History—
from Truth. Yet we try to hold on to our
self creation and prefer to weave the same
pattern which the Spider in a cobweb does,
We do not want to accept the truth, we
prefer to push it under a carpet which will
soon be reduced to shreds.
So

incapatiated

have

we

become

that

our conceptions of happiness and sufferings
do not come anywhere near reality. We
Choose to ignore the other side of a thing and

try to be happy counting our blessings,

But at times the man within us wakes
up from the slumber, which by killing our
conscience, we have drugged it to, for ages,
and because of which it becomes imPOSSible
for us to face facts, face reality and we are
reduced to impotent, misnomer of a man—
because truth frightens us ! We want to run
away in our sanctuary, the abode of stagnation, degeneration and rut.

it is impossible to change our rut witho f.
tackling the Stagnation which pervades
our lives, we need a Man or Men whose
words bite and burn, clarify and conquer
because they have the power of trubh
and they will only radiate the light of tomorrow’s dawn that streaks through the
depth of tonight’s darkness.

The voice in our heart that recommends
accepting the usual way of our life and even
thoughts, is not to be trusted. Sri Badal
Sarkar in his drama “Baki ltihash”, through
two characters Saradindu and Basanti, a
Professor and his wife, (coming from a middle class family) and their reaction to
a
news appearing in the Newspaper about
suicide committed by Sitanath, reveals the
limitations, Stagnation of our make-belief

reality—our sanctuary.
