But believe us, we few friends, few brothers and sisters, have Sat together and
have thought of dedicating ourselves of
fulfilling the pledge that we took and this
is why in spite of heavy odds, we are
presenting our second Production ‘Baki
ltihaSh, which, we are conﬁdent, you

will

like because it so lucidly gives shape to
the pathetic philosophy of middle-class
self contenment, sloth and indolence, Which
permeats atmosPhere in every phase of
our life and activity.
'Our earnest request to you is to apprise
us of your reactions and we also request
you to please advise us of any good play
which you consider has something original
in it, or if some of you have written any
play please send us a copy. Your suggestions will be the treasure of our .future
productions.

You will be pleased to know that our
Production ‘Ebang Indrajit’ won the second
best production prize at an All India full
length drama competition held in Lucknow.
We organised two notable functions IaSt
year, one was cultural and the other one a
literary sitting, both were quite successful.
It’s just because of our financial limitationS,
we could not invite you all on those occaSions. Any way we believe that we will r
turn the corner soon and in future shall "
be in a position to have you all with us at
all of our functions. Your patronage is our
greatest asset.

In the end we take this opportunity to
eXpress our gratitude to you all who have
given us the courage and Support. Our
best wishes go out to our colleagues and
com rad es .
