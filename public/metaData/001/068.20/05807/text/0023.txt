1986
After successfully staging "MUKTADHARA" of Rabindranath
Tagore, through a work-shOp organised by "NAN DIKAR" of Calcutta

on 2nd, March, 1986, we have earned another remarkable distinction
by way of presenting an one act play on ”lIliteracy and adult educa-

tion" name “SWARABARNA” written by Shri Joystnamoy thsh.
Both “IVIUKTADHARA” and “SWARABARNA” are marked by over
thirty five (35) stage appearances in 1986.

It includes our perfor-

mance in “Sree Ram Centre" at Delhi on September 14th, and 15th,
1986, where we were greatly patronized and encouraged by some

of the famous modern drama critics of the press.

In December of

the same year we organised a Drama Festival where ”National

School of Drama Repertory Theatre Co."

of Delhi staged two plays

(ANDHAYUG and NOKAR SATTAN MALIK HAYRAN).
