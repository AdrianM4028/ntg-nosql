Jean G enet’s
DEAT HWATCH
The play is set in a prison cell.
The occupants of the cell where
the action takes place bathe in
the reflected glory of the highest
rung of the ladder in the jail—a
convicted murderer

(Snowball)—a Negro. There are
three of them: Green Eyes. also
a murderer, but of a lesser rank
than Snowball, who murdered for
gain, while Green Eyes merely
killed a prostitute in a moment
when he had lost self-control.
Lefranc is a thief, and Maurice,
only seventeen years old, a
juvenile delinquent.
The plot of Deathwatch turns
on the relationships among the
three prisoners. Maurice adores
Green Eyes, who knows that he
will be convicted of murder and
is likely to be executed. Lefranc,
who has been writing letters to
Green Eyes’ wife because
Green Eyes himself is illiterate, is
jealous of Maurice. He has been
using the letters he wrote to
Green Eyes' wife to seduce her
away from her husband. not so
much to get her himself as to
break her relationship with
Green Eyes. When Green Eyes
finds out about this, he suggests
that either Maurice or Lefranc
should kill her after their release
which is due within a matter of
days. Which of the two will have
the guts to become a murderer
for the sake of their idol and risk
the guillotine, as he does? But
then Green Eyes breaks down.
He tells the story of the murder
he committed—he killed a
prostitute in a sadistic fury he
could not help. When the guard

brings him a gift of cigarettes
from the authentic murderer,

Snowball, he bequeaths his wife

to the guard. The young heroworshipper-Maurice—is deeply
disappointed at the
disintegration of his hero._ To
show that he, too, is really tough,
hardened criminal, Lefranc
whom Maurice has taunted with
the fact that he will never be on ,
of them (“You are not our kind.

You'll never be even if you killed
a man”), strangles the boy in
_ cold blood. Green Eyes still
refuses to regard Lefranc as an
authentic killer. “I didn't want
. (my crime)”, he says, “It chose
me.” Lefranc on the other hand
insists, “My misfortune comes .
from something deeper. It
comes from myself?" Green
Eyes wants nothing to do with
him. "I am telling you everything.
but let it guide you". cautions

Green Eyes. For his crime is an
act of love. It cannot be imitated.
it can only be invoked in ritual.
And. so Lefranc‘s homicidal
gesture is comparatively
insubstantial. lts wilfull nature
merely offsets the horrible
beauty of Green Eyes '
inexplicable crime of passion.
The characteristic of Genet‘s
theatre—his elevation of the
depths of society and the self to
a visionary theatrical plane—is
most marked in Deathwatch. l n
this play, Genet realises Artaud’s
vision (which is Genet's dream
as well) of a pure theatre in

which communion is possible.
The play gives a mythical
dimension to the dark side of the
human soul, projected like a
shadow on a prison wall. There
are no heroes here. The play
ends with Lefranc's realisation,
“I really am all alone."
