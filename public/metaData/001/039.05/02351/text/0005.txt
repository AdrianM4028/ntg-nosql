He only needed to show the
product abroad. His marketing
skills were no doubt sharpened by
capitalism and not Natyashastra.

mean he is actually scattered
because of his work being written
and produced in twenty different
languages, in twenty different

small towns of this vast country.

He knew his product well. Every
theatre production had to have
danCe, masks, martial arts, drums,

music and . most importantly very
little words, unleSs of course it is

in Sanskrit. This overenthusiasm
of the exporter would have been
harmless if he also had the
beurgeois dignity. Instead he
forced his will on the domestic
scene as well.
With his enormous power,
derived from his foreign
connections he quietly removed
Mohan Rakesh and the likes from
the theatre scene. Even Dharma
vir Bharati was taboo to him.
Bharati’s Andhayug, though based
on Mahabharata is mere Hindi
words. It had very little of the
exotic east in it.
If, today I have to make a choice
between this exporter and the
realist I shall certainly choose the
latter. Ebrahim Alkazi and Habib
'I‘anwir are the two examples that I
want to mention here for the
latter. It was Mr. Alkazi who
produced ,‘Ashad Ka Ek Din’ in
Hindi. As for Habib Tanwir, he
has been doing ’people’s Theatre’

Most importantly he lacks the
courage Gandhi showed in
picking up salt and holding it for
all the world to see. Such a
gesture, Gandhiji knew would not
transfer power. He was not even

interested in the transfer of power
then. He was simply stating a
truth.

How can I play harsh ’Chande’,
for example, inside this small
auditorium prescribed by the
Na tyashastra, measuring a mere
32 hastas by 32 hastas. How can I
wear huge masks and do martial
dance on this small and subtle
stage. It can only create noice

pollution and not truth. Why did
we not emphasise the primacy of
words as the most crucial aspect of
our Theatre tradition ? Did we
misunderstand Kalidasa so much ?

After half a decade truth has once

again taken the Centre stage;
though it looks as if a big lie has
taken centre stage. The collapse of
socialism and destruction of Babri
Masjid both shook us badly.
Precisely for this reason I want to

The West misunderstood
