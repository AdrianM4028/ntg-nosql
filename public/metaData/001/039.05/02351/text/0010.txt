On those men dawning the part of
the religious,

Gandhiji : ”Most religious men I
have met are politicians in disguise:
I, however, who wear the guise of a

politician, am at heart a religious
man . ”

Let me sun up this piece with a
quotation from Edward
Thompson, the father of

illustrious Marxist critic E.I’.
Thompson. this quotation tells us
in a way as to how Gandhiji
treated himself and his stafure as
Mahatma.
Edward Thomson (GANDHI) has

never been taken in by his own
legend... Mr. Gandhi has never
been a Gand hi te; he has preserved

a cool and slightly contemptuous ’
attitude towards his own sillier
entourage, and is well aware that
many of his votaries have not
helped his cause...
”He can be exasperating 1”
Everyone of us who has had
something to do with him has said
this at one time or another, and
said it with
affection l’...I watched him once...
while for three hours he was sifted
and cross questioned by a group It

was a reasonably exacting ordeal,
yet not for a moment was he rattled
or at a loss. The conviction came to
me, that not since Socrates has the

world seen his equal for absolute
self-control and composure, and
once or twice, putting myself in the
place of men who had to confront
that invincible calm and

imperturbability, I thought I
understood why the A themians
made Socrates drink the hemlock...

’He has set in action emotions and

hopes that are far wider than any
political grouping.....I have
criticised him a politician. But as I
have said elsewhere, he will be
remembered as one of the very few
who have set the stamp of an idea

on an epoch. That idea is
’ Non-violence ’ .
