Caligula uses his powers to explore the out-

ermost limits of freedom. The

ruthless

behaviour

and logic turns Caligula into a monstrous
who ultimately finds that

“one

cannot

tyrant

destroy”

everything without destroying oneself."

l feel really vibrant in the play.
ously fascinated me for years and

it has obvi-

the

real

crux

of the play is at the end where Caligula says, “I
am still alive."
