Director's Note

Karnata ka is a home of mu lti-cu ltu res. Freedom of Speech is the
sole pivot around which all creativity revolves. Every Indian
has been assured of Freedom of Speech by our Constitution.
V This provision is taking very many voiceless communities on a

path of progress. Very many deficiencies have been rectified.
The downtrodden people have forged ahead because of the
.
३ ३ Constitutionalprovisions.
Nobody can stop the changes that take place from time to
time, as old order changeth yielding place to new: Theatre has
always upheld progress, and proactive preoccupations as
३ sacrosanct. Rangayana has reflected these concerns in all its
activities. It has crossed many milestones during its journey,
completing the Silver Jubilee and at present it has entered into its 27th year of its fruitful
and creative existence.

Rangayana was established by the great theatre personality, the late B.V. Karanth,
who was a visionary. He started many things during the formative years of this repertory
theatre. Some people might say he left many things unfinished, but they too are aware
of the great legacy he left behind. We have the responsibility of keeping the torch alive
which he lit. We have to sort out the issues regarding the senior artists; establish B.V.
Karanth Museum and a few more obligations.

The present "Bahuroopi" of 2016 is the 13th edition. Like its predecessors, this
Bahuroopi, is showcasing full-fledge plays, street- plays, film festival, painting camp, folk
festival, besides the national seminar of significance. Come, let us celebrate "Bahuroopi
— 2016” which holds ’Freedom of Expression’ paramount in all our transa
ctions. This
edition happily coincides with Sankranti festival which marks the begin
ning of the
season ofjoy and mirth !
