collectable, valuable book about play writing. He has directed and acted in many Shakespearian plays and currently he is

directing the play ‘ Julius Caesar’ for Rangayana.

Julius Caesar is said to be play written in 1599. By that time Shakespeare had already composed eight historical
plays. All those plays were about England. For the first time Shakepeare chose a historical subject about outside England
and wrote a play. Rome was a republic and its political design was different from England. Since it was a democracy,
Kings and Emperors had no place there and the talk of tyrannical Monarchy was anathema there. Since the plays he
wrote before 1855 were about English history are identified as historical plays, Julius Caesar can be considered as
Shakespeare's first political play. It is not only a political play but it is the top most play that fits that description. Though
Julius Caesar is a political play written keeping the Roman political system in the backdrop, it is still the most important
political play applicable to all the countries, in all respects.
