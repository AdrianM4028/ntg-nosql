Bharata Li la.

Though essentially

This is a less rigid and a totally different form of theatre.
a musical form it leans more on verbal expression.

It is performed entirely in the round but again on ground level so that the
actors can easily sally forth into the audience as they frequently do. Dwari is the
main jester of the piece. The play in crux is a battle of wits between Dwari and

Arjuna in

which Subhadra Shri Krishna’s sister and occasionally Satyabhama

his spouse also participate.

The story is related to the Mahabharata sequence in

which Subhadra is given in marriage to Arjuna. As it is this story has a light
touch about it. It is made funnier still by an exchange of improvised
witticisms between participants. The target of attack is Arjuna and through him
the Pandavas who are heartily debunked by all. For instance Arjuna's pride in the
heroism of the Pandavas is made fun of by the Dwari who cites the example of
their humiliating position in Virathnagar while in hiding.

The repartees imply knowledge of the Shastras.

Book chapter and verse

are quoted in support of their arguments by each party not only from the
Vedas but also from subsequent books written by other authorities. ' The dialogue
is frequently improvised. And to this extent it remains a secular form for much

of its humour may be contemporary.

Not only through words is the satire projected. But the songs dances and
gestures are all sharpened to that end. The melodies dance steps and gestures all
follow a set pattern. Only the dialogue is allowed to go wandering into new
vistas depending upon the wit and knowledge of the participants. Bharata Lila
also known as Dwari Nata has a duration of 4 to 5 hours but may go on for much
longer._ Having a strong verbal bias this play is not being presented in its fullness.
Only one little sequence is selected to give the audience a flavour. This half hour
piece is used as a curtain-raiser.
