roles and sometimes even for male roles as in the

The present party comes form Kabisuryanagar a village in Ganjarn that is
particularly rich in folk arts. Even so the form has dwindled in recent years.
The fact that children take the roles of Subhadra in Bharata Lila and of
Prahalad in Prahalad Nataka seems re-assuring of the future of these forms. A
talented child actor after growing up is ready for the difficult role of Dwari and
naturally steps into it. Similarly a good Prahalad may end up playing Hiranya
Kasipu in later years. The demands Of virtuosity made on folk actors by the
initiated village audience are great. They call for years of hard work on the part
of actors. Yet the economics of folk theatre even in Ganjarn do not permit the
luxury of the vocation. Asa consequence many folk drama groups give up
the ordeal and wander away into other areas of activity that present a more
convincing mirage of employment.
