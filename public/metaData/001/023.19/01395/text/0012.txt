DIRECTOR’S NOTE. . . है
The 'Web' and ’Abortion' are among the very earliest exercises Eugene O‘Neill undertook
in his self disciplined apprenticeship to become a playwright. These two plays are
examples of the then developing timught and craftsmanship of the man who became the

first universally recognized world dramatist America produced.
"The Web" is not merely a sob story about prostitutes. It is in fact a deep study into
the phenomenon of “social circumstances" which spin their web and entrap so many
unfortunate people. In this play Rose is one of these unfortunates. And yet fate does not
stop here. It extends its claws to Rose's bastard child and then forms a web which extends
even into the future.
"Abortion" is a very controversial theme.

But as I see

for, mainly because the play does not even touch upon the

it, no

controversy is called

mortality or immortality of

abortion. What the play is actually getting at is the responsibility that man's greatest passion
(or whim) demands, namely love.

The

maelstrom of guilt,

pity and self pity that surge

through Jack's mind is O'Neill’s representation of the ethical consequence of the lack of a
sense of courage and responsibility.
This is totally a students‘ production.

The average age at all actors is just 17 years.

I must thank Mrs. Er Mr Rai for providing us their house for the initial rehearsals.
Further, I leave it upon you to judge our standard and tell us about it.

Hope you enjoy the plays.
