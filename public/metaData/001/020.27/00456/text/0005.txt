I got a script and put it on the stage and let it act itslef out. And it did... ............, The
play slowly began to grow.

As there was no individual protagonist, no particular hamartia, the atmosphere slowly
started emerging as the most dominating of all characters. It was the essential of the script, I
tried to promote it.
The entire dramatis personae thus become a part of the scenery and at the same time
remained its objects. The production thus has the same character sometimes as the atmospherse
and at other times the persons it blankets.
Because the presentation is not of a particular man, but of a particular type. Hence I
faced no problem of creating distinction. All the characters become the same character at times,
different characters at times, and at times all become the most dominant emotion or thought.
I hope I have steered clear of creating confusion unless when it has desiredly been enacted as a
part of the system'
