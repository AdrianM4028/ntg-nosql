I think theatre is a place of entertainment. Logically the next

question arises—What is meant by entertainment? Entertainment is
the stirnulations of the emotions through the portrayal of dramatic

situations, characterization and action on stage. ३ Why do people
attend the theatre ? They go chiefly because they want to laugh, to
cry, to be frightened, to be shocked, to be angered, to feel love for
the heroine or hatred for the villian. The theatre I feel is in essence a
place of the heart rather than of the head. It is not primarily a pulpit.
It is not primarily a debating place. Nor is it a platform for political
propaganda. It can be all these things incidentally, but only in so far
as they provide vehicles for the rousing of emotions.

Its primary

appeal is emotional rather than intellectual, so a play which is likely
to help the theatre to fulfil its function is one with a strong emotional
appeal. I am inclined to be suspicious of those theatre-lovers who
talk about ‘Serious Drama’. One suspects that they are more interested in the ’message' of the play than in the essence of theatre.
