Dr. ASHOK KUMAR GHOSH

It is with a heavy heart that we, the members of CHENAMAHAL, mourn the
untimely death of Dr. A. K. GHOSH, an eminent medical practitioner and a promoter of
art and culture.

The end came on the morning of July 10,1979.
Dr. Ghosh had an illustrious career.

Born on June 15, 1933.

An ex-student of the Union Academy School, New

Delhi, he had a natural bend towards science in the service of humanity which he held
dear to heart till the last day of his life.

An established rnedico with a sharp difference,

he nurtured a soft corner for his ailing patients who he treated with loving care.

Thi s

amiable nature made him a gem of a man.

But, this is only one aspect of his many-faceted talent. Perhaps very few in the capital are in the know of the fact that he had been an accomplished stage actor.

In the early

'503 when mixed-cast performances were a mere dream, he donned the female attire.

One of his first roles was "Monika" in “Rinang Kritwa", way back in 1952.

It is quite

natural that his first-love —to serve the humainty—Kept him away from the stage. But stage
he loved, and loved to his heart's content.

He had been the Vice-President of "Kaal

Chakra", a noted drama group, till his death.
In him CHENAMAHAL has lost a friend and a sympathiser

for he had always

lent us his helping hand.

He. was the second brother of’ CH ENAMAHAL activist Shyamol Ghosh.

leaves behind his wife and three children.
Our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family.

Dr. Ghosh
