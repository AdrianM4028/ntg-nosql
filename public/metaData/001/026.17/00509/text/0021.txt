A Day
To Remember
And Rejoice
I take this opportunity to welcome you all at the inaugural ceremony of the yearlong “Sliver Jubilee” celebrations of CHENA MAHAL.
What was born in 1955, out of the desire to establish a drama organisation of a new
type, has lived through 25 springs.

Naturally, we all are proud of this achievement, how-

ever modest it might be.

The past 25 years have not been rosy and smooth. We have seen many difﬁcult
days. But as they say, “fortune smiles on the brave,” we too have braved hardships and
seen the difﬁcult days through.
These 25 years have seen the onward march of CHENA MAHAL as the foremost
cultural organisation of the Bengali community in Delhi. During all these years we have
gained experience, and have become more steeled.

Today, as we observe this festive day, we remember with revenrece and gratitude
those who tirelessly and selflessly worked for CHENA MAHAL but are no longer with us.
Our thanks to those who are still with us and who are concerned over furtherance of a healthe sister
thy drama movement, here, in this cosmopolitan city. Our sincere thanks to
would
organisations but for whose fraternal and unstinted cooperation CHENA MAHAL

not have seen this day.
The “Silver Jubilee” celebrations is a joyous ocasion for all of us who are present
ion of art and
here today in this auditorium, as well as for those who strive for the promot
cul t ur e .

C.
It is in the ﬁtness of things that a prominent personality of the stature of Dr. P.
Culture, should have inauguratChunder, Union Minister of Education, Social Welfare and

for having accepted our
ed the “Silver Jubilee” celebrations. We are thankful to him
invitation and for being present among us today.
