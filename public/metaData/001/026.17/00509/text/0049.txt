"Six Characters in Search of An Author"
The rehearsal was on .... ..

In they came .... .. the six characters in search of an author.
“We have brought a play”, said the father.
"What play ? " the director enquired.

“Let us stage the play," said the step-daughter, "and then you would see for yourself...
Look at that boy..."
The Director and his entourage looked up at the far corner, and there he was.
“Ah ! Please leave me alone", said the son.

“I have nothing to say in this play"-

"80, you won't say anything ?" asked the father.
“What a mental torture this play would be for me ! ” said the mother.

The director cast a glance at the step-son and the youngest step-daughter.
No, they would not react.
And, the play was on.

It had quite a few surprises for the members of the drama company.
There they were, the six characters who had come in search of an author, and who
were re-enacting their life-story.
And, then, the inevitable happened.

Was it all an illusion, or a reality?
Who knows !
