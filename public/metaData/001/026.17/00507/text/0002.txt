The ‘Mahal’ known to you is certainly ‘CHENA MAHAL’.

Yes, during the short Span of its existence it appeared before you
every time with a drama bouquet different in colour and fragrance.
Sometimes you laughed, sometimes you wept and sometimes you were
lost-lost with the ideas, lost with the novelties, lost with the
performance and lost in disgust - monotony disgust.
That is why, your dream-child ‘Chena Mahal’ makes it maiden
venture in presenting Sarat Chandra Chatterjee’s “FATHER DABl”.
Let us hope, the undominatable enthussism of the participants
and perenneal assistance of the patrons and well—wishers will
lubricate the progressive wheels of your cultural organisation.
