OUR CHILDREN SHOULD ३
INHERIT A BETTER
WORLD

Family

Planning in our country is an essential part of our

whole strategy of enlarging welfare.

Greater

Welfare is,

in fact, the only reason for Family Planning. And we need it not
because we are against more children but because we want
every child to have the best opportunity possible in life. We
want our children to inherit a better world than our own. This
is the aim of every father and mother, and this is the objective
of planned development.
