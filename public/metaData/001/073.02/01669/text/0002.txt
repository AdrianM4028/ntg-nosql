This is the story of Imphal: Imphal, the canit l
of Manipur, a smal"1

state on the north-eastern corner of India.:

They call it the Switzerlari of India; the Kashmir of the East.
Imnhal, with its beautiful landscapes, friendly climate,

smiling neonle, colourful dances and haunting music- is indeed

a jewel of India. But, than, is this the Whole face of Imphal?
Imphal, after the second world war and more narticularly after
the

--

60's,

is a changed city. Slowly but steadily the germ

of urbanisation has entered into its tender and unspoilt lifeâ€”

and overnight the face of Imphal is changed beyong recognition.

In the past Manipur could really boast of such historical figures:
like

Maharaj Bhagychandra<in whose reign the famous Hasleela of

Manipur was introduced), Veer Tikendrajit, Thangal and Paona.
But today their statues remain in the heart of the city: silent,

cold, defiled and almost unrecongnised in the crowd. Sickness

pervades every section of life: the offices, the institutions,
the families, The young peeple have lost their sense of

direction, discipline, purpose and balance. Under the grillsof
such ct gges, the older once in the society become almost
irrelevant. But, then, is this an inevitable process?
A simple but a serious question. Who is to blame? The peonle
or those in authority? like it or rot: this is how Imphal, once
a little paradise on earth, has changed suddenly its treasured

life: beautiful, smiling, sweet and innocent.
