ABOUT OURSELVES
The potentialities of the theatre have never been so well recognised as in recent years. The
growth of dramatic activity in the country is a testimony to that. Slowly but gradually, the theatre is
to attain in our social fabric the position of a friend, philosopher and guide.
Diﬂicult as it is in this vast country to gauge how the dramatic activity is helping to build the
nation, the necessity for such an eH'ort needs no stress. For ten years now, the Song and Drama Division
has been inviting theatre groups from all parts of our country to perform once a year in New Delhi to let
the audience of the Capital have an idea of what is happening elsewhere. We have also tried to reach
the different parts of our country through our two Departmental Drama Troupes. All this to spread the
message of planners and builders of our nation.
Do you think, these efforts are useful in promoting better understanding and fostering national

integration? We think they do.
