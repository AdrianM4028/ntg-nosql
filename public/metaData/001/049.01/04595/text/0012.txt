Director's Note
I see Kafka as psychologically
complexed characters.
The ups and downs of Kafka’s
life since his childhood to his

youth inspired me to know
him more. But the more I read
about him the more I felt the

necessity of acquiring
information about him.

My interest was growing more
in his own life history than his
literary works.
In this context, ”letter to
father”, memoirs of Kafka,
letters to Felicia and to Milena
and after effects of world war

along with his contemporary
literature and his Views on
theatre, art, cinema, and youth

lead me to do this production.
This production is not only
portays bit of Kafka’s life
reflecting his Views.
Letter’s to father is definitely it
is launclhpad and in due
course analysis his reaction
and views on different
subjects.
I am very thankful to Mr. Bansi
Kaul, Asif Ali Haider Khan

and my team to have been
with we all through the
process.
