While the planning and design of the operations in
Kanpur are credited to Dhondu Pant Rao (adopted
son of the Peshwa. Baji Rao ll) Azimullah Khan and
Tantia Tope. Azeezun embodies the spirit which is
the anguish and hatred of her times; a woman who
transformed herself into a soldier; a crusader who
developed new traits in her personality shaking off
all that were once cherished by women to entice
and rule the male world. She is a person and a legend
whose stature in popular memory overwhelms
historical facts. But she is not the only one. There
are other women distined to tread on paths different
and to question her. But then, each to her destiny
and conscience that seeks and also denies salvation.
After all, it is history that must answer ultimately.
This play is dedicated to the never ending struggle
of men for freedom which, like the Ganges, takes

the good and evil alike in its eternal ﬂow.
