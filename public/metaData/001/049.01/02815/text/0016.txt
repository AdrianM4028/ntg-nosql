AZIZUN NISA
SAN SATTAVAN KA QISSA
Right at the centre of the market in Kanpur stands Azizun’s house, which was the place of dance and musical soirees, every evening and that
was the reason for all sorts of men, soldiers, money lenders etc. to frequent her house. Azizun is happily ensconced in that small cozy world
of hers. She has her special relations with one Shamsuddin, a sepoy in the British army. At this point of time however, Shamsuddin is a
'
deserter from the British army as he is unhappy with the goings on there.
A British officer comes to Azizun’s house in Shamsuddin’s trail, but he fails to get any lead from Azizun who would do anything to save her

lover’s life The British officer, however, warns her of the grave consequences and leaves.
Late at night, Azizun goes to the river bank where the sepoys are celebrating the memory of the revolutionary, Mangal Pandey. Azizun offers
to join them and be of assistance to them. One of the deserters there, Moharnad Ali, asks her to go to the British cantt. and keep an eye on the
activities there and report back.
Amidst the revelries in the British section of the cantt, Azizun meets Mrs. Wheeler’s daughter, Liza and Liza gives him an account of the riots
in Meerut and of the dernoralised British army which is in the grips of fear; but a British officer recognises her and in the resultant pandernoniurn,
Azizun is shot at, but she escapes. At her house, Azizun is met by Moharnad Ali and Sarwar. They inform her that the officer who shot at Azizun

gets reprieve on the specious plea of acting under intoxication and that she should be careful. Azizun curses her fate, not being able to take a
more active part, throws off her jewellery and takes up the sword.
