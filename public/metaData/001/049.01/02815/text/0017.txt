Then we have two characters, Roshini who believes Hameed is in love with her, whereas Hameed clings on to her only for her riches. Battle is
raging all around; Zubeda is horrified to see the killings and destruction that goes on all around her. At a distance, she spots a soldier severing
a British soldier off his head and finds out it is Azizun in their disguise of a soldier. Disgusted, Zubeda tells Azizun, she would rather return
home.
The market area is now under the control of Nana Sahib, freed of the British; Azizun, Sharnsuddin and others celebrate the victory. Azizun

starts singing but she has now forgotten the lines of the familiar joyous song. Ali Khan marries Liza, because he believes Azizun is a betrayer.
Sharnsuddin is killed as the battle rages and he is abandoned as many other dead soldiers are without a proper burial. Azizun, enraged vows
to carry on the fight as a tribute to all those who have sacrificed their lives. Ali Khan returns to his village defeated and tired; he wants to join
Nana Sahib; not finding him, he reaches Adilaâ€™s house where Hussa in and Azizun discuss further course of action. Zubeda is a witness to the

brutal killings in Bibighar and is horrified; if only she had been killed along with her parents, she wishes, she would have been spared of this.
Azizun is completely shaken; she is now freed of all concerns of whatever fate that awaits her.
At the break of dawn, the soldiers gather and mourn their fate in the silence that descend on them.

Roshini believes that it is the end of Company rule. Something to rejoice. She is also freed of Hameed. So, there must be celebration. She sings
the song that Azizun used to sing in the days gone by. For, after all, has she not taken on the role of Azizun now !
