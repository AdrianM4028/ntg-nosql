About Ourselves
.

Rangmanch, a registered non- profit voluntary 33८5०-

ci‘ation formed by some enthusiastic young workers
in the cultural field, fulﬁls the long felt need for an

organisation for the promotion of art and culture in
the Capital.
Not only} will it help in the synthesis of the
idea of great art and culture we inherit in the
different parts of the country, but would also provide
a healthy forum? for our young and promising
artistes. ,
