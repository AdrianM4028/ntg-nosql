Jubilee Fair (Oct. 22nd and 23rd)

Well-wishers of St. Columba’s who hold prominent positions in Delhi have
recently got down to planning a Jubilee Fun Fair which will be held at St. Columba’s grounds

on October 22nd and 23rd of this year.

Do let your children enjoy the fun there !

Others, still, are dreaming up numerous ways of helping to get our proposed new
buildings off the ground. In short, our friends, among whom we are happy to number you,
are showing that they believe that the time is ripe for Saint Columba’s High School to step
boldly into a glorious future.

To this ever-growing band of citizens, who are spending much of their spare time in
“domg” for St. Columba’s, we say “Thanks !” We appreciate their generosity and would be
pleased to see you join them.
We invite you to keep in touch with the school so as not to miss the “big days”
ahead—outings that you will surely enjoy.
