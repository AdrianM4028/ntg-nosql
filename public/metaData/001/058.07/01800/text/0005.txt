About t h e Play
The characters are divided
into two groups — one

supporting the king, his
son, daughter, and his four

useless ministers, and the
other consisting of the
Bain, the two Bhawarias,

and their companions. It is
through the Sutradhar,

standing apart from both
the groups, that the
playwright tries to project
the problems of a society
that is burlesqued
throughout the play.
The king would like to
know where the centre of
the earth lies and asks his
Mahamantri to locate it or
face dismissal. But the real
problem lies elsewhere: it
is the grey hair of the
young princess that spells
danger to the country. The
king orders: “Bring
scented oil from foreign
lands. Change the water of .
the pond where she bathes
every day. Build a sky-high
palace so that she can have
fresh air. Call the
physicians of the country
for the treatment of her
hair.” As his orders are
carried out, the king is

deeply hurt to find
corruption and
rnalpractices prevailing in
the country. After much

deliberation it is decided
to observe the year as a
‘year of culture’.
A young man is arrested
as he refuses to sing. This is
the climax of the drama
and the turning point, with
the people realizing that it
is the immorality of the
king and his ministers that
lies behind the princess’s
hair turning grey. Hence
they resolve to follow the
path of fairness and justice.

Director’s Note
Ojapali, a traditional
Assamese theatre form,
allows the players to move
easily from singing and
dancing to acting their
roles. Humorous
exchanges serve as a
bridge between the
performers and audience.
Popular in lower Assam,
Ojapali has always been
used to awaken people’s
awareness of social reality.
It was adopted as an
ingredient in the present
production in the hope
that it would effectively
convey the message of the
play to the audience and
contribute to the
conventions of the
proscenium theatre.
