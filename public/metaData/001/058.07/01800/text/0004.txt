DireCtorâ€™s Note

Radha: Rakhi

The production combines
realistic theatre and the

Krishna: Mihir Swain

traditional form of Kirtan,

with some of the actors
repeatedly changing roles.
The play projects a
situation where man no
longer believes in God,
and treats divinity like an
antique object, a
showpiece, sometimes

even a commodity. God
himself is so distressed that.

he tries to flee this human
prison. But for him there is
no escape.
