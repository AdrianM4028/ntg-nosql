SYNOPSIS

//

Heaven: The abode of the gods: Laxmi & Saraswati disp te their respective
merits. Narad Muni, the eternal prankster, encourages them and asks them to
descend to earth and test their merits there. The Dhangars (shepherds) are a poor
people, and yet happy. Laxmi brings about a flood which drowns all the sheep of a
Dhangar. The Dhangar goes to a Savakar whogives him some seed. He sows and

reaps corns—and the cams are all pearls. But what use are pearls to a man who
needs corn? The Dhangar was happy when poor; now he has pearls and yet
unhappy. Laxmi loses.

Now it is Saraswati’s turn, and she descends to a palace. Riches are a plenty, but
the minister is cunning and the prince a fool. There is a plot against the prince, but
Saraswati gives him ‘brains’ and ultimately all ends well.
Saraswati, goddess of the intellect, thus proves to be of more value than Laxmi,

goddess» of wealth. Saraswati, however, does not ridicule Laxmi and asks her to be
with her forever.
