January 10
RAMLILA (in Hindi)
Produced by: Meghdoot, Lucknow
Written by: Rakesh
Directed by: SM. Kulshrestha

SYNOPSIS
On an unclaimed piece of land in the city both Hindu and Muslim slumdwellers
live together in harmony and participate in each other’s religious festivals. They
decide to stage Ramlila and elect Puttan to play the role of Ram in it. They approach
.
Seth Kalika Prasad for funds.
But the Seth is a greedy man who not only becomes the head of the Ramlila

organising committee but is interested in grabbing the piece of land as well. He
agrees to fund the Ramlila on the condition that the Ramlila narrator, Bade Mian,

would be replaced by a Hindu and none but Hindus must participate. His own
daughter, Rashmi, opposes this move but he provokes the Hindus to evict the
Muslims from the slum.
The Muslims, led by Ali Bahadur, are enraged, and decide to evict the Hindus
and build a Mosque in the slum. Ali Bahadur attempts to make a deal with the Seth
secretly to get hold of the land but it fails. A riot ensues and in the communal

conflagration Puttan’s father is killed. Then the slumdwellers come to their senses
and Ali Bahadur joins hands with the Seth to form a communal harmony trust on the
same land which enables them to live together in peace.

DIRECTOR’S NOTE
The events in the play are related to Ramlila but the style of» production is not
confined to it and is derived from the basic elements of folk theatre. It is an
experiment to develop a theatre form with the barest of theatrical amenities such as
sets, constumes, make-up etc. The stress is on finding a theatre idiom for expression
with simplicity and directness imbibing elements of Ramlila, the most popular folk
. theatre of Northern India.
