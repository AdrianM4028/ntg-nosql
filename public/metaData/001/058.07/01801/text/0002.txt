SYNOPSIS
/

Heaven: The abode of the gods: Laxmi & Saraswati disp te their respective
merits. Narad Muni, the eternal prankster, encourages them and asks th'ern to
descend to earth and test their merits there. The Dhangars (shepherds) are a poor

people, and yet happy. Laxmi brings about a flood which drowns all the sheep of a
Dhangar. The Dhangar goes to a Savakar whongives him some seed. He sows and
reapscorns—and the corns are all pearls. But what use are pearls to a man who
needs corn? The Dhangar was happy when poor; now he has pearls and yet
unhappy. Laxmi loses.

Now it is Saraswati’s turn, and she descends to a palace. Riches are a plenty, but
the minister is cunning and the prince a fool. There is a plot against the prince, but
Saraswati gives him ‘brains’ and ultimately all ends well.

Saraswati, goddess of the intellect, thus proves to be of more value than Laxmi,
goddess: of wealth. Saraswati, however, does not ridicule Laxmi and asks her to be
३
with her forever.
