enactment the hero makes

a laughing stock of himself.
The Sutradhar interrupts
the hero and asks him to
present a modern comedy
with the same cast. The
hero agrees, but fails again.
He becomes extremely
pathetic. The Sutradhar
stops the performance and
vows not to appear on the
stage till he can tie the
knot between tragedy and
comedy.

Director’s Note
The play expresses itself
through the two
diametrically opposite
genres of tragedy and
comedy and offers a
chance to the performance
to go beyond them,
avoiding the realm of
parody.
The performance tries to
highlight the poignancy of
the central themes while

attempt to achieve
intimacy rather than
grandeur, to evoke
thoughts and emotions
rather than create '
spectacle.
