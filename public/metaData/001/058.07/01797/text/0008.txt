Perunthachan, the master

craftsman, belongs to the
village ofUllyannoor
which sprawls on either
side of a river. On the

right bank —
Valamcherikkara, where
Perunthachan lives — is

the village temple

Edamcherikkara. The
people of Edamcherikkara
do not have a craﬁsman
comparable to
Perunthachan and thus
befriend his son
Kuttithachan, claiming
him as their own. Bitter

rivalry results between
the people of either bank.

crowds disperse, Garudan
starts dancing again, as
foretold by the people of
Edamcherikkara, and
starts crossing the bridge
to Edamcherikkara.
Perunthachan, dismayed
that his creation should
have a life of its own,
throws a chisel at

Garudan, clipping the
bird’s wing. Kuttithachan
goes to Garudan’s rescue
