SY N O PS IS

The great essayist Francis Bacon wrote “prosperity r
is the blessing of the old testament, adversity is the blessing दृ
of the new”.
‘Kaal - Khand’, starting right back from 30 years may
evaluate and peep through its dramatic situation - on one
hand, the economic. development and on the other sadly the ’
growing dreadful 4 decay of the social milieu. Finally all the V
different strings held by my characters will rally around the
fact that the process of decadence has really helped

the

emergene of the phenomena of ‘S E L F’.
Emergence of this particular phenomena of ‘self’ is
strikingly so contemporary that it prompts me to pick and
conceive some characters from my rural people apple growing
society, which has with its sustained efforts and hard work

converted small barren slopes into a paradise of the appte
orchards to change the whole economic set-up and knit all
the strings together in an absolutely contemporary relevant
play. Though to prepare a play small group of characters is
conceived from the rural folk society yet the spirit and the

idea is to be conveyed universally.
