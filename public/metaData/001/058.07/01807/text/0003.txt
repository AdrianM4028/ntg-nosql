ACT 1 : The
play
opens
with
the
exposition
of
the
theme
of
martyrdom—narration-curn—enactment of the beginning of the battle of Karbala. The
play proper begins with the end of 3rd Mysore war in which Ruquiya Banu, wife of
Tippu is killed in the battle field. Against all advice Tippu decides for a treaty with
the British for he thinks that total expulsion of the British from the Indian soil is more
important than a temporary victory.

Mir Sadiq, one of Tippu’s Diwans plays truant and the British stipulate extravagant
terms for the treaty — surrender of Tippu's two sons as hostage till the
compensation is paid. The citizens of Mysore heave a sigh of relief that the war has
at last ended. In a public speech Tippu adurnbrates the goals of his Divine State and

announce his new democratic policies. On the other side Mir Sadiq injects
disaffection among the officers and connives with the deposed Queen.
ACT S2: Due to historical forces beyond his control and the continued conspiracy
by Mir Sadiq and the Queen, Tippu fails in his attempt to muster support from the
foreign powers. But the British takes this as a pretext to invade Tippu.

ACT 3: Everyone of Tippu’s trusted friends either deserts him or dies. Dewan
Poornaiah advises Tippu against the continued fighting but when it is unheeded, he
resigns. Mir Sadiq becomes the commander of the army. He executes 16 trustworthy
Generals on false charges. However, he is caught red-hand when he kills a dissident
and dismissed by Tippu.
The British storm the fortress and inflict atrocities on the hapless refugees. Tippu
cuts short his meal, proceeds to the front and fights bravely before he is killed. The
play concludes with the invocation of the end of the battle of Karbala.
DIRECTOR 3 NOTE

Orthodox histories of Tippu Sultan's reign, written by Anglo-Brahmin scholars,
present a distorted view of that period. Historical understanding is a process at
once subjective and objective. In order to present a more objective view of Tippu,
whose life fascinated me, I had Shivaprakash write this play. He undertook the
difficult task of interpreting the many contradictory versions of the events of that

time. We have tried to present history through subjective and objective approaches
because myth folklore and rituals consist of the interpersonal subjective grasp of the
objective phenomenon of history. The play uses the Moharram legend and rituals.
We are interested in the use of folklore not for its own sake but to deepen
the theme.
