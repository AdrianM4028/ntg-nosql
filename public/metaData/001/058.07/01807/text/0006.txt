A Play in Telugu

Translator: Sharat Poornima

दृ
Director: K. G. R. Gandhi
Presented by: Kala Tarangini, Vishakapatna, AP.

8YNO PS | S :

Chanakya, the chief minister in the court of Chandragupta, dislike the Nandas and
wants to make Rakshasa a minister To this end he devises an ingenious plot.
He gets a letter in the handwriting of Rakshasa's friend Sakatadasa, puts the seal
of Rakshasa’s ring (which a spy has procured) and has Sakatadasa arrested. The
ieweller Chandanadasa, a trusted friend of Rakshasa, gives shelter to Rakshasa’s
family and helps them to escape, for which he is condemned to life imprisonment.
Thus the plot to capture Rakshasa proceeds.
Rakshasa counters Chanakya's plots with his own devices. In the meanwhile
relations between Chandraputa and Chanakya are soured. Chanakya quits his
ministership and leaves. This news pleases Rakshasa. Chandragupta’s anger against
neighbouring Kingdoms comes to the fore but Rakshasa is spared. When the time
comes for Chandanadasa to be hanged, Rakshasa intervenes, There Chandragupta
and Chanakya press Rakshasa to become a minister. Rakshasa agrees in order to save
r- 5 friend and himself.

3 l में E C T O R ' S NOTE My intention is to render a hieg stylised Sanskrit play with the use of the most
Dooular folk idiom of AP. called 'Burrakatha'. Added to this some more folk forms
in small measure have used with advantage such as ‘Tummeda Pata', 'Yama Pata' and
Ko | ata m .
An attempt is made through this traditional ClaSSlC of Vishakadatta to give a kind
of sooal relevance relating it to the modern period by juxtaposing it with the most
DODular folk form of A P. thereby bringing home the play to a large
audience —— both urban and rural.

This adaption has another advantage of usmg three main dialects of AP. namely
Tei‘angana, Srikakulam and Godavari which makes the people of different parts feel
at home
