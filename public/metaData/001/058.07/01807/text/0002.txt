Sangeeth Natak Akademi, New Delhi and the Directorate of Kannada and Culture,
Government of Karnataka, Bangalore, are happy to present the South Zone theatre
festival of plays with folk elements. The annual zonal festivals, leading to the
national festival, have been encouraging the emergence of new plays in Indian
languages which use an indigenous idiom, inspired by our folk and traditional
theatre. A modern theatre with its own crop of new playwrights and rooted in the
culture of the country is what this programme of festivals hopes to create.
The emergence of new talent in all areas of the theatre during these festivals has
been a matter of satisfaction. We hope the trend will continue this year and in the
years to come.
