The Maharashtriya Kalopasak, a body recognized by the
Sangeet Natak Akademi and Bombay Government, was established nearly twenty-ﬁve years ago for the study and development
of arts in general and dramatics in particular. This amateur
organization was originally started on a very small scale, but
progressively its activities have developed, and now include

organising study circles, competitions and classes for children,
competitions for playwrights, etc. It has also participated
every year in the Bombay State Dramatic Competitions.
The organization has built up a library and a museum
which help students in post—graduate studies and research
work.
