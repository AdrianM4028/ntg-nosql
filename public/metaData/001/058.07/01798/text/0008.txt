The Three Arts Club, a body recognized by the Sangeet
Natak Akademi, was formed in Simla in 1943, with the object
of promoting the art of theatre. Since its inception, the Club
has produced more than a score of plays, most notable among
them being ‘Faisla,’ ‘Zamana,’

‘Hamaara Gaon,’ ‘Uljhan,’

‘Dhong’ and ‘Under-Secretary.’

Besides its own productions, the Club has been assisting
other theatre groups in Delhi and other neighbouring towns.
It organized a festival of its own plays in Delhi in December,
1956, and January, 1957.
The activities of the Club have not been conﬁned to Delhi

alone as it has taken several extensive tours and performed at
different places.
The Club has also endeavoured to serve the people
through the theatre. It helped in collecting funds to the tune
of Rs. 12,000 for such humanitarian cause as the Tuber—
culosis Fund and again for Lok Kalyan Samiti, Delhi, to create

a mobile dispensary van for slum areas.
