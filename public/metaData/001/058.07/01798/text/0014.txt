The Allahabad University was the ﬁrst to open a section
named ‘Cultural Activities’ under the Presidentship of Prof. U. S .

of dance, drama and music, organized under its auspices was
inaugurated by late Dr. Amar Nath Jha. Since then it has
staged a number of plays like ‘Khoj,’ ‘Utsarg,’ "I‘aj Mahal Ke
Ansoo,’ ‘Nadi Pyasi Thi,’ ‘Mausere Bhai,’ ‘Sanjh Sabera,’
