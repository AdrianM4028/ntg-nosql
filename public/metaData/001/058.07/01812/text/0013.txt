Devadatta watches her in silence and tells himself,
"Watch those purple flames in her eyes. How could you
imagine she could resist him? Strangle your agony. Don't
look away. Stop being a coward."
Kapil returns with a whole heap of' flowers. He
delights Padrnini with his description of the flower: its
yellow petals are auspicious like turmeric, the verrnillion
circle in the centre is like the ti/aka mark on a woman's
forehead, the orange streak resembles the line in the
parting of her hair and the row of black dots the necklace
of beads worn by a married woman. It's the Soubhagya
flower. Kapil then describes the landscape, the temple
of Rudra to the right and beyond the hill, the temple of
Kali, now dilapidated, deserted.
Devadatta hears the words, almost in a trance. The
chant of Kali resounds in his ears. He refuses to accompany them to the temple of Rudra and insists on being
left alone. He has made his resolve. Let these two,
whom he has loved so deeply who are almost a part of his
own self, live happily together. He must find the courage
to redeem his promise.
He begins the steep ascent
towards the Kali Temple. Near the lonely shrine, he spots
a sword and lifting the weapon, cuts off his head. Its
mask rolls off and the blood continues to course.

Kapil and Padrnini return to the spot where they had
left Devadatta.
Crazed with worry, Kapil sets out in
search of his friend. He follows the imprint of his footsteps
until he reaches the Kali Temple and sees the severed
head. Overwhelmed by guilt and sorrow, he uses the same
sword to slash his own head. Padrnin i, feeling abandoned
and lost, decides to follow the direction in which Kapil
has gone. As she enters the Kali Temple, she screams
with terror. She holds the two heads to her bosom.
