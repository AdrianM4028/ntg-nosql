â€œFor where the single essence has fallen. into such
conflict, it were best it melt in the flame of life as an
offering of butter in the sacrificial fire."
The song describes the ritual of Padrnini's preparations

to ascend the pyre and become a San.
Let us wrap a silk garment round her.
Cover her forehead and the parting in her
hair with red.
Build a pyre of stander/wood.
For this is a sacred event.
