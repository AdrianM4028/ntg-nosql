Kapil enters. He has been delayed because he thought
that one of the oxen of the cart wasnâ€˜t good enough for
the journey. Devadatta coldly informs him that the trip
has been called off because of Padmini's condition. Kapil
is crest-fallen. The days ahead are going to be empty.
He tries to conceal his anguish. (At this point, the narrator softly warns him to keep away from the couple.) And
Kapil is almost ready to leave, when Padrnini intervenes.
