A gal/ant rider once rode in here,
Which could be the land from where he came?
He 1) ree zed in and vanished smiling.
His turban was studded with gems,
Rows of pearls swayed on his chest.
in his fist was a sword with diamonds on the hilt.
A gal/ant rider once rode in here,

And waited through the thrusts of Time,
smiling again.
