Attach the heads back to their bodies and press the
blade of the sword on their necks,” Kali answers.

“But why did you let them die in the first place .7 You
the All-Knowing who could have stopped them ?"
“Those two rascals!" shrieks Kali. “Devadatta — he
had promised his head to Rudra and a mere pair of hands
to me. Because you went to the Rudra, Temple, he
came here and offered me his head, didn’t he? As for Kapil,
not even a mention of me! It was Devadatta, Devadatta
all the tirnel Maybe he was afraid that people would
think he killed Devadatta for your sake. Anyway, you,
at least, were honest — even if it was all in self-interest!
Besides, I had to think of the living seed in your womb.
Now don't waste any more time. Do what I told you to do.
Get going." Kali is clearly impatient to go to sleep again.
In blind haste (or as Thomas Mann says, ’not quite
and altogether in blind haste'), Padrnini transposes the
heads on the bodies. As the men come back to life, there
is momentary excitement.
Whose the head? Whose the body?
We can't wait to unravel this mystery.

This question—answer style of folk expression mirrors
their feelings. But soon they realise the implications of the
mistake.
A fight is about to ensue. Which of the two is Devadatta .7 And who is Padmini's husband .7 The :rite of
marriage is consecrated with the bride holding the hand Of
the bridegroom before the sacrificial fire and the hand is
part of the body. But among all the limbs, it is the head
which is supreme. How will this problem be resolved ? ३
