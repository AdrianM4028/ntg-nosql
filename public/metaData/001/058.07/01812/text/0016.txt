This ancien tale from the Veta/panchvimshati is now
again recounted in song as the metal (demon) relates the
story to King Vikrama, raising the query and pleading for
an answer. Vikrarna replies, “The Ka/pataru ranks highest
among trees and the head is supreme among all parts of
the body.“

The narrator reiterates that a sage has also decreed
that the man with Devadatta‘s head is Padmini‘s rightful
husband. Resigned to this defeat, Kapil disappears into
the forest.

Padrnini gives birth to a son. Gradually the strong
body supporting Devadatta’s head assumes its earlier
softer contours and Devadatta himself seems to have lost
his former flair for scholarship and poetry. The puppets,
bought for the child, sense the change in him and add
spice to the situation, through their own reading of
Padmini's yearnings for Kapil‘s sturdy frame. “Devadatta
is changing. Perhaps Kapil, too, has changed. As for me?
Change, change and more change. Is there no way out of
this cycle ? Drop by drop the pitcher is filled to the brim.

We have glimpses into the changing relationship between Devadatta and Padrnini, her revulsion for his body.
The child is now the centre of attention and the dolls are
relegated to a corner, abandoned. But they hover around
Padmini when she is asleep, describing her dreams — the
frequent appearance of a man, his proximity to her ...what
can it mean?
All through the scene are snatches from a
lullaby.
