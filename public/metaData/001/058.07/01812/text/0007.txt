had doomed him, was transformed into a celestial being.
His wife stubbornly refused to accompany him to his
abode in the heavens for she wanted him to remain a
horse. In his fury, he cursed her, turned her into a mare,
and disappeared into the sky. The mother-mare pranced
away happily, leaving behind their offspring, Hayavadana,
half-man, half-horse.

Hayavadana has done everything possible to become a
complete man. His personal life is unblemished; he has
tried to immerse himself in social 'Causes'. But where is
the society to which he ’belongs’?
Yes, he has visited all the shrines. But no .. he won't
consider going to Tirupati. His silken mane will have to
be shorn and that’s his dearest possession.
The narrator suggests the shrine of Kali on Mount
Chitrakoot. She is said to grant man‘s innermost wishes.
Hayavadana hastens to leave, with the villagers showering
him with directions on how to reach his destination. At
this point, the narrator cautions him gently.

Providence ordains our fates and all our longings
The curse of infinite imperfections afflicts all beings.
