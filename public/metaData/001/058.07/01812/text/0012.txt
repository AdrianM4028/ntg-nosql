“When we are going to start ? We are already late." She
offers an explanation to Devadatta. “He looked so dis.
appointed. I felt sorry for him.” The three start lifting the
bundles to be carried to the cart and the narrator remarks

that while they seem so busy, each is engrossed in his
own thoughts. The song has a touch of foreboding, even
as we hear the jingle of the bullock-cart bells during
the journey.
A dark shadow as/ant a lighted path,
At every step a strange stirring,
Beneath a touch-me-not bush, a coi/d serpent,
Hood raised to encircle your feet.
Today a flower might well be ripped from its stem.
And a bird flee its nest.

The journey begins and they halt in the glade of the
jungle. Padrnini says she enjoyed Kapil’s smooth handling
of the oxen and the cart and compares it jestingly with
Devadatta’s clumsy driving round the lake in the city.
She is struck by the glorious flowers on a nearby
tree. Kepil hastens to fetch the blossoms for her and
Devadatta watches the fascinated look in her eyes as they
follow Kapi I ’s movements. The erotic lines and melody of
the lavni emphasize the power of this physical attraction.
Sturdy in build and dark in colour,

His broad chest, his strong shoulders.
How one longs to clutch his wrists.i
The sheer male in him — / fea r Has cast his spell on me.
I gaze at him once, twice, and yet again
Youth at its peak,
A tapering waist, lithe as a leopard.
He is like a bee cruising among flowers.
A favoured guest in the heart.
