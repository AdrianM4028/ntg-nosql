The core story is resumed and the narrator reiterates in
song the ties of friendship that bind Devadatta and Kapil.
Two friends, one heart, one mind

A // inseparable as water itself.
Devadatta is sitting alone, despondent, lost in thought.
He has caught a glimpse of a beautiful maiden and, to
the background of a solemn chant extolling Mahakal i, he
vows that could he but win this maiden, he would offer
his head to Rudra and his hands to Kali.

Kapil enters, brimming with excitement, eager to relate
to his friend his victory over a famed wrestler from Gandhara. Realising that Devadatta is immersed in his own
world, he asks, “Which one is it this time? You have lost
your heart to fifteen girls these two years.” But this one is
special. Devadatta describes the magic of her charms. Quoting lines from Kalidasa, he says that if he had this maiden
to inspire him, he might even outshine the great poet. He
repeats with grim urgency his pledge to Rudra and Kali.

Hearing the desperate note in Devadatta‘s voice, Kapil
asks her name. Devadatta can tell him nothing. After
much questioning, Kapil learns that she lives in Pavana
Teertha. Devadatta can barely describe the house. All
that he recalls is that the door-frame had an engraving of
a two-headed bird and as her soft hand touched it, it
almost came alive.

Kapil has found the clue. Why does Devadatta need
the cloud-messenger or the bumble-bee of Kalidasa‘s
poetic fancy .7 Kapil will himself locate the girl, plead his
friend's suit and Devadatta must promise to forget those
pledges to Rudra and Kali. But how can Devadatta banish
the memory of his vow?
