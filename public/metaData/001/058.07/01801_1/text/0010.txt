MUKTA DHARA (ln Gujarati)
Produced by: Saptasindhu, Ahmedabad
'Written by: Rabindranath Tagore
Directed by: Bharat Dave

SYNOPSIS
,

This is the story of an empire, Uttarkut, ruled by King Ranjeet , who subjugates a

' neighbouring state, Shivtarai. The King designs and builds at enormous human cost
a huge dam in the middle of the river Muktadhara to deny water to Shivtarai.
At the integral festival, there is a terrible, hue and cry by the King’s exploited
subject, women like Amba who have lost their sons and relatives in the building of the
darn.- All who ‘protest are killed, the survivors approached with ﬂattery and fake
consolation.

The King ﬁnds a child on the bank of Muktadhara who, it is prophesied will be the
future emperor. The King brings him up as an heir.

Yuvraj Abhijit grows up and resovles to free the water of Muktadhara and by
doing so, achieve freedom for all. The Shivtarai people have a spiritual guide,
Dhananjay Bhairagi, who tells them not to submit to any authority but God.

A war of passive resistance is waged by Dhananjay and the Shivtarai people
against the brutal force of Uttarkut. Yuvraj Abhijit sacriﬁces himself for the freedom.
His life mission is fulﬁlled. Muktadhara begins to flow freely once again.

DIRECTOR’S NOTE
Tagore’s very famous play—consists of Jatra elements—to my mind it’s a play for
total theatre, a poetic imagery presented through music, songs, colour and
३

movement.
