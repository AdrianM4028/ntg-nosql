SYNOPSIS
After the creation of the world, God distributed all things equally between the
Devatas and Rakshasas. The Devatas lived in harmony but the Rakshasas became

jealous of them and started a war against the Devatas.
The Devatas approached the Supreme Lord for their safety, who gave them the
power to kill Rakshasas. But Saroi Ningol Atombi, the younger sister of the
Rakshasas, escaped. She approached Salainlen Shidava, King of the Devatas, who
made her queen of his kingdom against the will of the Devatas. The Devatas
attempted to destroy the new-born child of Saroi Ningol Atombi. But a prophecy
was heard not to kill the child, as he was to accomplish the Lord’s wishes. The Gods
left the child in a dense forest and fled.

For several years the Devatas in their bliss forgot to make offerings to the

Supreme Lord. He in anger flooded the earth. The Devatas were in great distress.
Meanwhile, another prophecy was made to offer Saroi Ningol Atombi to lraipurel

(God of Water) for the safety of the Devatas. Saroi Ningol Atombi, for the sake of the
Devatas, offered herself to Iraipurel. She became his wife and was known as
Iraileima.

The child who grew up in the midst of the jungle was known as Nongda Apam
Thoiba. One day, Apam Thoiba met his long-separated mother Iraileima while she
was taking a bath in the jungle. The beauty of Iraileima attracted Apam Thoiba, who
molested her. After realizing Iraileima was his mother, Apam Thoiba repented his
behaviour and scooped out his eyes.

DIRECTOR’S NOTE
The play is based on a myth of Manipur and is written in free verse. Rituals of

Saroi Khongba, martial arts of Manipur and elements'of tribal and folk music of
Manipur have been used for the production. It is not confined to one particular form
but there is a search for ﬁnding out a contemporary theatre idiom inspired by our
traditional forms.
