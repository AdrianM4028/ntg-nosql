DIRECTOR’S NOTE
The content of the play has allowed us a formal treatment in both nat—
uralistic and stylized extents. The form tries to achieve happy dialogu: between the abstract and the realistic, resulting in a form which we wish
to call ESSENTIALlSM (a form that is typically oriental). The whole—
‘sale dealer Munimji is treated naturastically, while the people ofArooakhoa is treated in a stylized manner and Tagore’s dance drama. A special
mention should be made or” the attenpt to utiliz the ‘Trailor’ form or”
Gambhira of Mald. The subplot of this play has been formally treated through abstraCIions of dance, masks Charis, interspersed with songs.
