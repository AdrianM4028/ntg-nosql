SYNOPSIS
KEIRAK means essentially the ladder. After the act of creation
the Almighty descends unto this world and merges with the living being
below. His place at high above becomes a place craved by the people
below. The whole play centres around this ascent to high. However.
since, the living beings have not the essential requisites to perfection
and awareness, the world becomes a living hell where man exploites
man.

Through the act of

ascension,

the powerful took all shares of

those whose dim existance never has the benigh experience of down.
