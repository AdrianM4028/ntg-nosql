Kambar is an eminent play-

wright of our times. This
play ‘Siri Samplge’ is wellknown for its theme which

deals with the duality and
ambiguity of mind and
body and is also quite fa—
mous in Karnataka and
takes its source from the
ﬂoklore which was also the
basis of Girish Karnad's

play ‘Nagmandal'.
I read the play in English translation which

touched me deeply. The
structure of the play, the
situations,
the
cones—

ciousness torne by the du—
alities and the intense ex—
perience made it difﬁcult

how should I transfer this
structure of the playwright
into Hindi. The Director,
Bhanu Bharti, also was

insistant from the beginning that as far possible,
he would not like to use
the Yakshagana or South
Indian theatrical conventions to communicate the

play in Hindi and, naturally, since this play was specially translated for his
production, I tried to take
theatrical exaggerated conventions, old Hindi, of
northern region and other
eminent popular folk styles
of my own Mithila—region
and the combination of all
that filtered in my transla-

er slightly worried, naturally, for I had exaggerated
narrative language of
Bhagwat and Mayawati in
the beginning of the play.
Bhanu had, in fact, want:
ed that the play must begin with the great sense of
somberness ofJapan' ‘Noh’
play and sould move fur—
ther with the dignity of that
theatrical convention. My
understanding of the starting of the play was different but it was too late and
it was mutually agreed
between me and the Director that the Director will
change the initial portions

play for the Hindi version
as we thought that the heroine of the play ‘Siri Sample’ does not suit to be the
title of the play. According
to our understanding, she
is not the subject of the play
but it is something which
will be better reﬂected in
the new Hindi title ‘Aks—
Tamasha’ (which literally
means playing of the imag-

es). Keeping the Hindi
spectators in view, we also
changed the name of heroine ‘Siri Sampige ‘to’ ‘Rani
Saampa’ ‘Kalinganag’ has
been often referred as
‘Naga'raj’ or ‘Kaliyanag’.
Other references have been
kept intact because the
structure of the folk tale
does not create any
hinderance in getting it accepted. During the rehearsals, the Director, the team,

the Music Director and others have improvised, added or subtrated, for which
