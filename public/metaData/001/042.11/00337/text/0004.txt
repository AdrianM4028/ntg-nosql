Director’s Note

study the play and in
the process he starts living with it
and the production which
emerges on the stage is the play
which has suffered a tumultous
journey through the insides of
the Director and has appeared,
perhaps, metamorphosed.
I state bluntly that as a Director
my relation to the play is that
of a spouse. The playwright can

decide upon my sex as per his
inclinations. I may be the husband
or the wife but never the midwife.
If after seeing the play you

feel ﬂattered. The desire for

than the playwright does. The
playwright after having written the
play becomes a normal limited
prejudiced human being. His

But whatever the ﬁnal score, if

the play is a success, the maximum
credit should go to the playwright
and then to the actors and as a
Director I am only too happy to

take the third place. But on no
account will I share the discredit
of a failure. It is totally mine.
