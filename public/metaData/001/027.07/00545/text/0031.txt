There is the Old Man who drinks only to drown his sorrows and Cassandra—
hke prOphestses the Doom. There are the Four City Wastrels who dissipate their
days in meaningless profane talks. There is Phatada, their companion, who is a
thwarted person. wastes his musical talents in singing wicked ditties. There is his
woman who had been promised much but has got nothing but a shame to live down.
And there are Ram and Shyam who meet by chance and try to recognise each
other. and

themselves through

the

cracked mirror of their

lives, cynical and

frustrating.

There is demented Sona. the butt-end ofjokes, who still searches the sun-lit

Life. Amidst all these Another Man tries to ﬁnd the Road that leads to all that
symbolises the Best in Life.

making, we are saddled wrth conﬂicts none of us started, but still we are so deeply
involved in It.
