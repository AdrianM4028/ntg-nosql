DAKSHINEE

has organised its First Annual One-ActDrama Competition with fervent desire to stimulate the amateur
dramatic movement as well
as to encourage local dramatic talents in the Capital.

All objective observers would recognise that the Bengal
i dramas, staged.
in the Capital in the past and in the recent years,
show the remarkable vital
role that drama occupies in the cultural stream of
the community. In this
context we remember with gratitude the pioneers in the
ﬁeld but we also wait
for those ayant gardes who will make it wider and deeper.

We recognise that the One-Act play, though conceived as
a Curtain-raiser,
has in recent years snapped its umbilical cord to develop into
a full ﬂedged

genre of its own.

So we hope that the plays produced in the Competition will
not only
act as a mirror for the aspirations of the participant groups but
will, as
well, provide a magnifying glass to the hopes, trials and tribulations of
the
world we live in.
