O N E-ACT- D RA M A
T he beginning

One—Act-Drama is a gift of the English-Stage.
It grew out of the
‘Interludes’,——projecting a self-contained theme needing a very few actors to
work up a humorous situation. The intense impact that such dramas made on
the public mind gave to it an entity, and called for greater experiment in this
ﬁeld of dramatic art. It ceased to be a “ﬁller” or a “curtain-raiser” of a
long drama. The success of One-Act-Drama depends on its compactness
and a deft crystalisation of human vibrations, life-force, and spontaneity. The speed
and tempo of the constituent elements of the situation to conclusive head is the
very essence of its success. An One-Act-Drama confines itself to a single event,
episode or situation, and that consequential sequence should grow out of itself.
The natural ‘birth’ of situations should be spontaneous and easy and enable
them to grow and converge to a point.
The momentum should grow as the
situation develop naturally, and not contrived artiﬁcially. . The drama should
start with an element of suspense so that the attention of the audience is
immediately arrerted. The three-unities, that is, the unity of time, place and
action have to be maintained to give to it the needed shape, direction, sense
and tempo. A logical continuity of theme, time and scene invest the situation

with a totality and unity and these should not be overlooked.

Dialogues should be crisp, smart and impressive. Small words should
create large eﬁ‘ect,-—therefbre, the words should be adequately paused, modulated
or emphasised.

The One-Act-Drama must present a theme that is interesting, fast moving
and short and should end with an absorbing climax so that the beauty of life
and essentials of art are not missed.
