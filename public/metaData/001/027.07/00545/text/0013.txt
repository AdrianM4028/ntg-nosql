Kshitish Sen exhibits in this drama how 3
Dust Bin takes part in the extra
professional activities beyond its usual comm
itment of serving as a receptacle of the
refuse of its clientele. It feeds the poor, enliv
ens the weak, kindles emotions and
retrieves the lost kindred.

An old man driven mad by the loss of his hearth
and home came to it for
help in ﬁnding out his daughter abducted ten years
ago. This Dustbin formed the
mucleus of the generation of love and ambition of
a young man when he found a
young girl by his side and a gold ear-ring too. Here
only did a tiny little girl get an
incentive from a small boy to earn more by changing
the stock-in-trade.
Sen does not, while recognising the predominant positi
on of hunger,
disregard the inﬂuence of the other impulses of nature.
