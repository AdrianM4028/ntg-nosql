DIN A NTA

by
Biru Mukhopadhayay

Misfortune compels Gokul to take up the job
of a hotel-boy. But aspirations,
to rise high in life and gain social status remai
n alive and he continues his studies.
He wins the sympathy of his master and customers
which make Jharoo, his colleague
in the hotel, jealous and he succeeds in sending Gokul to jail
under false Charge

of theft.
Unprotested action of Gokul makes Jharoo to realise his folly so much so
that when Gokul’s blind father Abinash visits the shop, Jharoo welcomes him as his

son, Gokul.

The cloud of evil thoughts, thug, disappear from the mind of Jharoo.
