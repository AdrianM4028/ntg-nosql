Our Needs: They are not many. We
need you, your mind and your cooperation.

You know that “Dakshinee” was born with
an idea to serve the
cultural, social and educational needs of Bengal

As a ﬁrst step, “Dakshinee” was registered as a bona ﬁde body in

To operate, a room at 70, National Park Lajpat Nagar 1V, New Delhi,

functioning in the end of August, 1964. There are
arrangements for in-door

The total number of members is about 80. We have
various expansion schemes, but footing the bill is our main
