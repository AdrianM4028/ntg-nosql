TA M A SA R T E E R E

by
Ra men La hi ri

Man is mortal but not his soul.

Even then the soul becomes polluted when

man is overwhelmed by the constant attacks of passion, anger, greed, emotion,
violence & vanity.

By repulsing these attacks, man gains immortality, when he enlightens his
soul with the light of boundless unpolluted love.
