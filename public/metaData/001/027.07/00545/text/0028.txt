The Vibration in this unique design is generated according to rOlling principles. A rotating
shaft is mounted on only one set of bearings at the top of the Vibrating tube. An impeller is
provided at the bottom of the said shaft. This impeller rolls inside a collect ﬁxed at the lower
end of the Vibrator. The relation between the impeller and collet is so chosen that impeller
makes eccentrically around inside the collet several times while making one rotation on its axis.
In this way automatic step up is achieved (4 to 7 times). This explains how the frequency of
inspite of the fact the

REVOLUTIONARY Vibrator can be so high (10,000/21,000 V.P. M.)

ﬂexible shaft is rotating at the same speed of the prime mover ( 2,000/ 3,000 R.P.M.)
