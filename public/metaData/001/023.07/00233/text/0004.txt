Hamidulla’s “Ek Aur Yudh" is a dramatic depiction of a young lady
of literary temperament whose inner psychological conﬂicts result from the

disorder she 'sees in the world. ~ Finding no solution to any of the social
problems that she has seen and about whom she has felt so much, she

approaches a psychiatrist for a symbolic treatment to the occasional
psychic ﬁts she suffers from.
While undergoing the treatment she has to remember and at the same
time analySe selﬁcritically all those events about whom she has deeply felt
the lndo-Pak war and the imperialist manoeuvres in it, the philistine

outlook of the new rich, hypocrisy of the bourgeOis politicians, exploitation
of the farm-labourers by cruel sahukars of the village, unemployed
youngesters । and their resustant frustration, communal riots, phrase
mongering ultra-leftists, ivory-tower intellectuals and artists and the cruel
network of bureaucracy. All this she has also appeared to have seen
within the short span of her life and subsequently got utterly confused.

This disorderly world as a part of her psychological make-up and her
quest for a solution is what is depicted and dramatised in the play.

The

ultimate solution she ﬁnds is—to rebel against the system which has
given birth to the evils of society, i.e. capitalism.

But the moment of her

self-illumination is not liked by those forces WhO represent Status QUOThe play ends with a note of conflict between the forces of status quo and
those agains it.
