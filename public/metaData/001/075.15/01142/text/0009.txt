Besides areas of Gopachal and Bundelkhand which are lesser known today——
SBRG intends to do some intensive work among B hils.

Gonds (and many sub-castes

and sub-cultures among Gonds) and the Chhatisgarh belt.

Although art lover know

about this region, but what is presented in the name of Bhils, Gonds and Chhatisgarh
need lot of correction in depth study and re—evaIUation.

Besides documentation, classification. etc., the Shanti Bardhan Revival Group
will do two defferent things in preserving these fast disappearing art forms.

1.

To include such amature/nonprofessional and/or semi-professional groups
in its own repertoir and eXpose them to audiences all over the country.

2.

Invite the Gurus of these and encourage them to teach dances and theatre
forms (in Danut theatre workshops) to eXperienced and professional artists
of Kala Samooh's folk dance Ensemble.

3.

And then urge other dance institutions to conduct such workshop in their
regions with Shanti Bardhan Revival Centres active support.

4.

And lastly publish the work of the Revival Group with illustrations when
the Project is complete. The includes audio visual (both motion picture

and video).
