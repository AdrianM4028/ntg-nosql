About the play. . . .

Johnny is quite a successful playwright but he seems to know very little about
life and about women in particular. Goaded on by his wife Kay, he portrays in his latest
play Octavia as Marion, a very high minded person, who in real life is Clive's wife. Marion
resents this and having found out that Clive has been unfaithful takes it out on him by
trying to get Johnny interested in her. This fails disrnally. Misunderstandings occur all

round but all are reconciled happily in the end.
