The British High Commission Amateur Dramatic Club celebrated its twenty-ﬁfth
birthday in 1975. During its long life it has produced in public more than ﬁfty plays and
there were some enthusiasts doing so even before the Club was founded.

There were

no special Silver Jubilee celebrations but we did get in two productions during that year.
By putting on live plays in public, the ADC has helped to keep English language theatre
alive for Delhi audiences whose support and encouragement has been much appreciated.
It is unique in Delhi as being based solely on the voluntary resources of a single
organisation that has maintained its existence. at times against overwhelming odds, for
as long as India has been independent

We do hope you will enjoy the performance of this play.
