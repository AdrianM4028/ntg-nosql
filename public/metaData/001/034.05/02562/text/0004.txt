On the same day in 1936 as King George V lay in state in
Westminster Hall the ashes of Rudyard Kipling were laid to rest in

Westminster Abbey. “The Times” the next day had a poignant
headline “The king has gone and taken his Trumpeter with him”.
This entertainment is due in large measure to the literary judgement,

knowledge and enthusiasm of KINGSGLEY AMIS to whom it is
dedicated. The words are all drawn from Rudyard Kipling’s letters,
poetry and prose.
