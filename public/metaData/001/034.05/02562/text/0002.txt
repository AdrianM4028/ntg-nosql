Rudyard Kipling has added more phrases to the English language

than any writer since Shakespeare : The White Mans Burden, The
Female of the Species, East of Suez, Paying the Danegeld are all
h is.
He was born in Bombay in 1865. He spent only 7 years of his adult
life in India, working as a iournalist on the Civil and Military Gazette

and then on the Pioneer, before leaving at the age of 24 to achieve
almost instantaneous and
worldwide acclaim. He
roamed the world, but
those 7 years were the
source of his brightest
inspiration. India, its heat
and smells, its people and
its mystery, captivated him
and held him for the rest
of his days. He explored
for the ﬁrst time in
literature the real life of
the Private English soldier
Thomas Atkins Esq. It was
an exploration he made
with a typical bitter
honesty.
He settled in Surrey at
Bateman's in 1902, a home
which he left to the
Naticnal Trust and which
is now kept as a memorial
to him.

He was an intensely
private man and suﬁered
the blows that he received
in life with stoic reserve;
the death of one of his daughters, Josephine, at the age of 6; the
loss of his son John who was 17 when he died at the Battle of Loos
in the Great War and the increasing illness which affected his later
years. He died on the 18th January, 1936. It was his wedding day.
