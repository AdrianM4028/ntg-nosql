What’s missing
in the
B OAC VC IO?
Annoying things like noise. Like seats that are too hard, or
too small, or both. Like wayward air-conditioning. Years in
advance of any other airliner in the world, the BOAC
Rolls-Royce VClO leaves the sound of its rear-slung engines
far behind. You travel in cool silence, relaxing luxuriously in
the most comfortable airline seat in the world. It’s a totally
new experience—you’ll never want to ﬂy any other way
again!
And by the way, ﬂying by BOA C VCIO costs no more than

any other airliner!
