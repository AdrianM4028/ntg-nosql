“Endangered Species” is a two-person show created by
The Kosh for its tenth anniversary in 1992 and is inspired by the
vaudeville veteran Johnny Hutch’s career in showbiz. It uses,
in the process of recreating the ambience of the music hall, dancing, singing,
acting, clowning and acrobatic skills to satirize every song and dance cliche
from hearty opening to closing chorus. This is a tour de force by two brilliant
performers whose split-second timing is breath taking. This wonderfully
entertaining show creates a sad, funny impression of an act,

and a relationship, on the skids.

“ ..... familiar music hall routines translated into a volatile concoction

of dance, song and breathless words” - The Observer
“ Sharpened to knife-edge accuracy, leavened with sure-footed humour,

this is pure enjoyment”. - Glasgow Herald
