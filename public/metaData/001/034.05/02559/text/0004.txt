The British Council opened in India in 1948 at the invitation of
Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru with ofﬁces in
Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras and libraries in nine other cities,
managed jointly with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, it is the
British Council’s largest operation overseas.

The British Council aims to sustain and strengthen Indo-British relationships
by creating enduring forms of collaboration between institutions
and individuals; by managing joint projects which directly meet
India’s development needs; and by demonstrating British achievements
especially in science and technology, the arts and humanities, and education.

It seeks to combine British and Indian ideas, talents and experience
through the common medium of the English language.
The British Council is committed to bringing the best of British performing
and visual arts to India. It is equally engaged in facilitating innovative
Indian work of high quality being shown in Britain to
encourage meaningful exchange.

One of India’s leading hotel chains, Welcomgroup has over the years
promoted the cause of the arts through its properties spread all over India.

The group’s philosophy is simple — ‘to provide food for all the senses.’
Thus theatre, dance, music and art, all become important and essential
facets of the complete guest experience.
