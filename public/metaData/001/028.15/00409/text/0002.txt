“Death be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for, thou are not so,

For, those, whom thou.think'st, thou dost overthrow
Die not, poOr death."

The death of Deepak Modi, in painful circumstances, has
grieved his innumerable friends and admirers.' The Theatre
Club is particularly.the poorer, because of his active association with it right from its inception.

'Deepak was ever

willing to perform any task for the club - be it stage mana-

gement, set design or poster design — in fact no work was
too small or too difficult for him.
adience will remember him,

Perhaps, many in the

for his enthusiastic portrayal

of thesiingy marvari producer in Utpal Dutt's

'Chayanat',

or his stellar role as Ahmed,the frustrated middle class

householder, in Nasima Aziz's 'A Slow Tomorrow'.

He also

gave brilliant performances in 'Marjiva’ and 'Kisi Ek Phool
Ka Nam Lo'.

Perhaps his last contribution to Theatre Club

is the beautiful poster, displayed at the auditorium entrarce
which he made for this play.

Deepak was a very sensitive person of refined sensibi—

lities.

A painter of miniatures, a man of great erudition

and human warmth.

The'theatre world has lost an artist of

'

great potential.

"To live in the hearts of those we love,
is never to die.”
