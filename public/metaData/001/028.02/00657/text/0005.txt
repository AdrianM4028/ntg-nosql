A Word From Author
Wajid Ali Shah also has its political message.

The title character is

an innocent like Lin Tse-Hsu, / through in another way—he has the artists
innocence-and great tolerance.

Finally, he

was deposed

by the British

with the connivance of his mother, because he was a little too idealistic.

The British alleged that he had run down the government of Avadh. But
Wajid Ali Shah couldn't understand why making wars, collecting taxes
and sending people to prison were more important than

dancing,

singing

fraternizing. The British expected him, as did his mother, to dole out
more patronage to the art of war than to the art of the theatre. It is a
conflict of ideas

D irector's

Note

The idea of staging Prithipal Singh Vasudev's two act play woven around
the controvertial personality of Wajid Ali Shah had been germinating in
my mind long before its stage presentation.
From the very beginning l have been convinced that music which was
the very soul of Wajid's creativity must assert its presence in the play.
It has to be

there not only to accompany dramatic developments of

particular scenes

but to go into heart of the pivotal conflict.

It is a conflict between two irrconciliable forces—the lust for beauty and

the lust for power. In order to project a clear-cut stage-graph of this
conflict l have had to depart from the sequence of scenes as arranged
by the play wright.
ThUS,

the

opening scene

introduces the two characters representing

the antagonistic forces ~Wajid engrossed in rehearsing his composition
and Begum Kishwar—the Queen—mother spelling out a prophecy of his
doom. In the following scenes of first half we witness Wajid and his
companions' colourful explotis ending (significantly) in a mourning note.
In the second half the forces of destruction take their toll. Wajid looses
the throne of Oudh, a fact he has forseen as an inevitablity. But the
British cannot depose him as king of music, poetry and dance.
