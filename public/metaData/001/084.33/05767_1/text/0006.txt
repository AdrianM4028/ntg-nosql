and her meeting with Jason, the Greek Hero who comes
to Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece, leads to a great

love—and an even greater hatred. After stealing the Golden
Fleece they flee from Colchis and their crimes make them
notorious, but they marry and have two sons. But Jason
becomes ambitious for royal power and to obtain this he
leaves Medea in order to marry the young daughter of
Creon, King of Corinth, and thus became heir to the
throne.

As the play opens Medea has been deserted. She
is almost totally alone —- her only friends are Nursa, her
personal slaves and Mentor, who has come with her from
Colchis; her

children’s Tutor; and three citizens of Co—
rinth, who form the “Chorus” of the play commenting on

the action. Medea is always concious of being a foreigner
in an alien land and thus not afforded the protection of
the State, she is a great advocate of the rights of women,
bitterly resenting her subjection to men in all matters, and
she is a woman who has an obsessive love for her husband.
All these elements combine to lead her across the borderline of sanity and into taking a terrible vengeance on
Jason, a vengeance which involves Creon and his daughter,

- and her own children.

There is no justiﬁcation for Medea’s actions. We
can only try to understand the dark forces within her

which draw her towards destruction.
