this population played no part in the theatrical life of the
community. I wanted to change this situation, but to do so

I had to learn and understand something of Indian drama
and the way of life from which it springs.

In November, 1 97 9, I attended a theatre festival
at Bikaner and I was particularly impressed by the talent,
vitality and the theatrical ﬂair ofthe Rangan theatre group.

In talking to the members

afterwards,

we

appeared to

have a very similar approach, enthusiasm and commitment
to the theatre. On planning a return trip to India, I sugges-

ted to Rangan that I stay in Bikaner for a longer period
and that we try to carry your association further fortunately they agreed.

On arrival at Bikaner, we initiated a series of in:
formal and unofﬁcial “workshops”. We read plays, analysed them, rehearse scenes from them, and had many and

varied discussions on the theatre in particular, and our
different ways of life in general. We have had many “ups”
and “downs”, many obstacles to

overcome, many mis«

understandings to contend with, but I hope we have each
learned something from this association.

A venture such as this is like

building a
