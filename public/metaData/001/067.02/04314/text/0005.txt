THE PLAY

Nirrnal Gupta is a primary school teacher, a husband, a
father and a representative of the middle class which is
caught between its ambition to live an upper class life
and its struggle to survive in its own class. Besides
being a struggling middle class man, he is the director
of a struggling theatre group, committed to serious

theatre, which adores him and trusts him and survives
on his ideas. In course of time he is picked up by the

media and chooses to take on a new assignment and
keeps the group in the dark till one of them finds it outâ€œ
and confronts him with the information. The sell-out
involves doing a stage production with a star in preference
to the better actress who has been a loyal member of
the group all the time. The group, hurt and shocked by
the betrayal, breaks up, but there are a few who are
determined to start from scratch and build the group all
over again with the old idealism intact.
Behind the director selling out, one sees yet another
story, that of his family, where the director rules as the
patriarch, making almost a cult of his directorial ego,

neglecting his wife and children, who live in terror and
misery. When Nirrnal Gupta, the director, sells out to
glamour and money, one asks : did he sell out to give
his family a better deal or was there nothing after all but
an overbearing ego that would ride roughshod over
family and group alike?
