‘CHOOHEDANI’ (Rat-trap) is about the vestiges of feudalism, where the
crippling hold that a dead system still exercises on a family in which man’s
creed for idleness and total dependence holds the women in thrall, till one
of the women runs aways and the other one collapses, and the man is
left

helplessly humiliated and shattered in the end with a reality, he has refuse
d
to face in the beginning for quite, a long time; and become the pathetic victim
of his own paranoia'.
