‘Adamkhor’ means eater. The play starts informing the audience of some
disaster the city had. It seemed the whole civilization was swept in the natural
0a l am ity.

Two persons who represented the civilized upper strata of the society survived the wrath. They met each other near the sea. It was a question of survival

for them. They found nothing to eat. Their civilized background in the face of
misery was put to test. They indulged in the uncivilized acts. Perhaps all their
life they had been wearing the mask of culture and now we saw their real face.
In the past they thrived on the labour and toil of others. Now when they
were to attend to their primary needs of even ﬁnding food for themselves they
were proved incapable. They discovered the food but could not toil to get that.

A labourer passes through that way en route to his village. They caught
hold of him and demanded f'ood. Forced him to provide them the food.
The labourer who himself was hungry gave them the food. But what did they
give him in return!
The play tries to depict the characters we meet in our daily life. The people
posing to be civilized and cultured but are barbarous and exploitative.
