Court we see a mockery of the judicial process which was conceived letter of
the law. Bhushan has no faith in the law and refuses to defend himself. He is
convicted. Kotiswarayya celebrates his victory in a wild drunken orgy in which
Janaki is sacriﬁced.
The advent of democracy and universal suffrage by secret ballot marks an im-

portant change in the progression of the society. Power is no longer directly associated with wealth and politics are re-oriented to mass appeal. Kotiswarayya and
Bhushan contest the election and all the characters cast their votes. This process
of election by secret ballot provides the Professor with an opportunity to interview the characters and reveals to us their naked minds.
Bhushan wins the election and Kotiswarayya in an uncontrollable rage

destroys everyone in sight and in the process destroys himself. This model of
a civilisation thus ends up as another Mahenjodaro. The Professor appeals to
our good sense to prevent such a calamity from engulﬁng our entire civilisation.
