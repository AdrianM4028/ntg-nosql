Angar
by
Utpal Dutta J

Angar is a play of Protest against the exploitation of human labour by
crude merchants of proﬁt. Set in the background of a mine disaster in the Fifties,
the play attempts to portray the life of Coalminers — the toils they have to
undertake, the hazards they have to face so that the wheels of civilization may
move forward.
The inexorable logic of maximisation of Proﬁt at the cost of the safety and
security of the miners lead to the accumulation of dreaded methane gas in the
mines of Sheldon Colliery. Sensing danger, the workers portest and stop work.
The prolonged strike is broken and the miners are persuaded to go down the
gas ﬁlled mine by the lure of monetary reward. Disaster follows. The brooding
shadow of disaster grows as the play progresses and the characters ﬁnd themselves trapped in the dark labyrinth of despair caused by the tyranny of man
against which they are powerless.
In spite of all the technological development which we have achieved since
independence events like Chasnala is a grim reminder that we have yet to atone

our past neglect. Sanatan’s dying appeal to the mankind to ensue that let no
miner meet such tragic end still remains a distant dream. In paying our humble
tribute to the toilers of Chasnala let that dream be our hope and prayer.
