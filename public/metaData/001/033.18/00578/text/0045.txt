“Trutiya Pruthi bi’ ’
by
Prof. Kartik Ch. Rath

We cling to the charter of humanity and proclaim ourselves as human.
beings on this earth! Our pursuit is eternal— from ‘a’ to inﬁnity, from zero to
indeterrninant.

Vanquished on the chequered board of life, we have left behind

us a few worlds of our creation. They may be ‘Dwapara’, may be "Iretaya’,
or ................ Tormented by a slakeless thirst and an ageless agony, ‘Puranic
Rama’ had a life-long hunt for the golden deer. What was his reward ? What
could he bequeath to us ? And we ............... ?
This world .........where we are chasing the golden deer, we are eternally
aﬂame amidst dejection, despondence, pretensions, deceit and treachery, .........
beneath a mask of culture, civilisation, religion, art, language and discipline.
We, the social animals, are under persistent stress and strain, enslaved by

the chains of conventional social regulations. We are perpetually engaged in an
unholy competition for a false glamour, a hollow fashion and a dead logic!
Hope, aspiration, dream, desire and love, are all here, like the golden deer...... a

receding mirage !
Is this the "I‘rutiya Pruthibi’ ?

Is this the ‘Third World’ ???
