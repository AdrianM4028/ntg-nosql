support in running the Competition. We have, however, decided to continue
with the hope that the object behind the endeavour will be appreciated and
attained even though we are far from breaking even.

The co-operation of the mixed audiences who have witnessed our shows is
highly commandable. We are grateful to the participating teams and the
players who have appreciated the true spirit behind this venture. Our thanks
are also due to the judges, and to all others individually who have helped us
organise this eﬁort smoothly. Last, but not the least, we record our sincere

gratitude to the concerns who have advertised in this souvenier to contribute
towards raising a part of the outlay and to the Management and Staﬂ‘ of M/s.
Beauty Print for bringing out the Souvenir in record time.
We do hope that our patrons will enjoy the shows this year.
