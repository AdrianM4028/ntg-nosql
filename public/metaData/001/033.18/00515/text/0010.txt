He promises to release the king if he would
teach him the magical art of turning the
people of the country, his two friends in

particular, into a pack of sheep. The
Rakshasa king agrees but once he gets back

inhuman strength comes upon Hiramon
who rushes out to kill youngmen. The

it has no consideration for friends or
relatives. But when the Rakshasa's magic
gives back to Hiramon for a few lucid
moments his human sensibility, Hiramon,
the sheep, weeps in shame.
