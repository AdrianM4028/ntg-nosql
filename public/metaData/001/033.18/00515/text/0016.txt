’Sayak' has built its own theatre audito—

auditorium has become very popular
among the group theatres of Calcutta. [1

Mikhail Saltikov Schedrin was one of the
greatest Russian writers who adopted
satire most effectively in the field of
literature. He was one of the favourite
writers of Lenin. This drama “the tale of
two masters" has been adapted from one
of his compositions entitled ”Tales". The
two masters—a retired politician Shri
Gajanan Ghosh alias 6.6. and a retired
l.P.S. officer Shri Bakreswar Banerjee
alias B.B.—while listening to Ananda, the
hawker, suddenly reach an unknown
island named Titirmou. In that serene
and holy land they come in contact with
the simple folk and discover that abstinence from work is a crime and that every
one has an equal share in the golden
harvest of the earth. How could the two
masters acquiesce to a situation of this

nature? So they adopt a strategy. Bansi,
a hard working youth, beaming with life
and vigour, is allured by temptation. How
this triggers-off an intriguing episode.
what happens to Bansi and what end the
two masters meet when the ’wise man'
of the island steps in ? And what does
all this unfold for our modern society? [3
