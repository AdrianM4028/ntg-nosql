The Group

Theatre Commune
’Theatre Commune'—established in 1 972
under the leadership of actor-director—
playright Nilkantha Sengupta—one of
the most important theatre groups in the
family of non—commercial troupes,

is not only typical in the best sense of the
word, but has won immense respect by
dint of its hard work leading to professional
competence as well as its complete
commitment to the highest ideals of art.
'Theatre Commune' is very much alive to
the struggle between the classes and
believes in reaching the audience in a
straight forward manner.

And the fact remains that ‘Theatre
Commune' still steadfastly retains the
ideals of a commune, each member
equally sharing in the rights and
responsibilities, while operating on a
healthy budget. So far 'Theatre Commune'
has produced seven full-fledged plays :
Bibhur Bagh (1 972)
Parabarti Biman Akraman (1 973)

Swan’eShi Naksa (1 974)
King—King (1 97 5)

'

Dansagar (1 976)
Prastuti (1 978)
and
7. Jeebika (1981)
One of the most noteworthy efforts of
the group has been to introduce Munshi
Premchand to the Bengali theatre
audiences with their resounding production
of Dansagar based on Premchand’s
short story Kafan.
’Theatre Commune’ is one of the prime

constituents of ”Calcutta Repertory
Theatre" of Gal/leor Jibon fame D

The Play

Jeehika
(Livelihood)
Here the downtrodden people are forced
to live under the odious yoke of rural
exploitation. They have to earn their living
by various abominable odd jobs. A chronic
jailbird Santosh Taki is newly out of prison.

He decides to go straight fOr the sake of
security and hankers after a peaceful life.
He teams up with a vagrant couple, Bhaben
and Shyama, also wanting to make a
living and be left alone. The sense of
peace and security in this semblance of
family life provided by the household
deters Santosh Taki from taking up his
old profession.
