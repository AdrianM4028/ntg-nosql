Scene V

Mantharaka the tortoise has a lakeside home. Loaded with learning, he is
resourceful; Welcoming his friends, the Crow and the mouse, he shOws them round
the lake, which he calls his 'shrine of learning'. The very mention of 'shrine' reminds
the mouse.

of the remnants of Priestâ€™s alrns hung up for next day.
The priest and his Cruru plan to search for the mice's hoard; the mice, overhearing,
decide to take a roundabout course. Their luck is out, however; many are pounced
upon by a cat and the rest are robbed of their riches by the priest. The despondent
mouse had just decided to abandon his home when the crow meets him.
