Scene X

The friends learn of the tortoise's fate. They hit upon a plan of rescue. The deer,
feigning death, lies down near the hunter's path and is discovered. The overjoyed
hunter sets down the tortoise and runs home to fetch a pole to carry the deer.
Meanwhile the mouse cuts the tortoise loose and all disappear.
Scene XI

The hunter has departed and the woods are safe again. Through cooperation and
mutual aid they have won peace and freedom and secured their happiness.

If beasts can win so great a prize
Of friendship, why should wonder rise
In good men who are true and wise?

theatre arts eSpecially dance, music and decor, in addition to its work as a
performing professional company maintaining high standards of performance.
