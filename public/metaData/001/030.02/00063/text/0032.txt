THIS BOY HAS

A LOVING MOTHER
Mother knows that children’s
dresses are more than mere

clothing ; they are a measure of
a mother’s care.

She takes no

chances—they have got to be
lovely, comfy and durable.
Dressing a child well is
a family tradition.

When BINNY’S started manufacturing
their quality cloth nearly eighty

years ago. young mothers in India
discovered a new standard in textiles for
their sons, for here was variety in colour,
design and texture undreamt of before.
As the years passed, BlNNY‘S continued to
pioneer new materials, including anticrease
suitings and union fabrics. Soon
Bl NN Y became a household word and
buying BINNY’S a family tradition.
Today, more people are able to buy more cloth.

but discerning people look for the reassuring
BlNNY’S trade marks on the cloth they buy.
