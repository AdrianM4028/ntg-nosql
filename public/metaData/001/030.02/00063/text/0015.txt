Dam! the..5.th September, 1959
Dear Mrs. Mazumdar,
Many'thanks for your letter No. NS/2453/59, of 22nd
August, 1959.

2. I and other members of the Pakistan contingent to
the Seventeenth International Scout Conference enjoyed
immensely the performances put up by the children at
the Children's Little Theatre.
The themes chosen for

the performances suited the little performers admirably.
5. We all liked the show and marvelled at the high
standard shown by the players.

We enjoyed ourselves\

immensely while watching the show, and I am sure that
it must have given great joy to the children who parti-

cipated in it.
4. You have rendered great service to your nation by
organizing the Children's Little Theatre movement.
I
hope that it will grow from strength to strength.

Yours sincerely,

(N, M. Khan)
National Commissioner
