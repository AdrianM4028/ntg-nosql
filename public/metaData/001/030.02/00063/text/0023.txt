To work with children and prepare with them a children’s ballet is
a thrilling experience for any adult. There is an overall atmosphere of joy
prevailing at the time of every rehearsal. All the little faces are solemn with

concentration and their eyes are brighter than ever.

We, adults, are struck :

how serious they are : And how happy !

One ﬁnds it hard to believe that these very same children, who just a
minute ago were dashing against each other out on the playground, taking big,
clumsy leaps across the ﬁeld, hopping on the stepp and jigging up and down
in their seats, are the same graceful little beings we now see smoothly gliding

across the stage wholly living in the rhythm of the music.

It is precisely this innate urge of growing children to run, to jump,
to move that ﬁnds creative self-expression in ballet-lik dances.

Here, indeed,

is the justiﬁcation of the modern trend to bring more and more children to the
ballet s t a g e .
