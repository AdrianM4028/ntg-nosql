hopping should be trusted, to; then relaxation and full bodily extension,
in such excercises as moving like rag dolls, wooden soldiers, stretching up to

the sun, reaching out to the horizon or sinking into the ground could be stressed.
Later a series of natural movement which had a dramatic signiﬁcance could
be developed—for instance, creeping down the hall, peering round an imaginary tree, seeing something which frightens them and running back homeand so forth. At this stage elTort in rirverriertt( such as propOunded by
Rudolph Laban ) must be understood and the child introduced to movements
of gliding, thrusting etc.

Children can also

be asked to make partners of

their own based on these efforts dictated by the individual ideas they wish to
express. After a while, it will be found that children are beginning to
express themselves in movement without any fear or embarrassment and
going on moving and making their own steps, interpreting rhythmic bzats and

even to move freely to given music.
When children are given opportunities to move and to express themselves
they develop qualities which are of tremendous importance to all act1v1t1es,

since expression in the arts gives not only a natural approach to all acadermc
subjects but also a more conﬁdent basis for tackling the difﬁculties of social
relationship. Therefore, to teach academic subjects before children have
eperience of eXpression in the arts may be elucationally an unsound

practice.
