When they are young one of the most

important things is to see if we can help them tO'retain their vivid
imagination and their sense of wonder which they are so apt to lose
as they grow older, and I have not the least doubt that this is what
you are doing in the Children's Little Theatre, and that it will not
only give them delight in the present but will Open new horizons
for them in the future.
My best wishes to you in your work for the boys and girls
of India.
