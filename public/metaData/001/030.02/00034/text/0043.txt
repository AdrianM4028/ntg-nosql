Plays, Mimes, Folk—Songs and Dances.
All the artists taking part in my programmes are adults.
For the ﬁrst two years we played
only in this little hall, and experi—
mented with various methods of pro—
duction, watching closely the effects

on the child audiences. Then we
began to pay attention to the many
requests we had received from other
I T is difficult to compress the work of
twenty-six years into one short
article: all the ups and downs; the
hectic busy days; the long days of

waiting for plans to develop; the moments of great happiness; and the
moments when one neared despair.

But perhaps if I adhere only to the
uplands I will cover the ground in
the few strides at my disposal.
On the 19th of November, 1927,
I started my Children’s Theatre, in a
small hall in the centre of Glasgow.
My ideal was to present children
with good entertainment; to let children

towns asking us to come and give
performances. We were asked to visit
other parts of Glasgow also, for only
children with parents or aunts or
uncles willing to take them could
make the journey into the busy centre
of the city, so I began to see that if

we were going to do our job properly
we must not sit in comfort and ex—
pect children to come to us, no, we
must go to the children; we must go

into the suburbs, into the villages,

and to the next town. From that time
we became a travelling Children’s
Theatre, and have been so ever since
—a day here—two days there——and

on red letter occasions a whole week in
one building. We play in theatres,
town halls, village halls, schools and

see good plays that they could understand and enjoy, hear good musm

that they could appreciate, and enjoy
gay colour, movement and rhythm
that would set their hearts dancmg.
In short I wished to introduce children
to the joys of the theatre.
To give as much variety as possible

colleges.

We have our own little van which
carries a complete stage ﬁt-up with

curtains

and

lighting,

cases

of

costumes, folding properties, and every-

thing we require, so if we arrive in a
bare school gymnasium with nothing
but prosaic rib stalls, or a bleak friend—

into a theatre in a few short hours.
