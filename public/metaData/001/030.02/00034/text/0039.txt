Hence the seminal share that the poet

His interest in it was a

he ﬁrst formulated them half a century ago. Tagore’s unhappy school—
days obviously gave the initial impulse
to his educational thinking. When in
his turn he had to deal with the educa—

starting a school of his own at Bolpur
in the Birbhum district of Bengal.

This was the beginning of the school
which has now become famous as
Santiniketan throughout. the world.
His primary idea was to spare his
children the rigours of his own child—

How far Tagore has succeeded in
achieving the goal he had in mind for
