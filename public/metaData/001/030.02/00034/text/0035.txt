but it will not be wrong to presume
that these, too were done in the
ancient times and the standard of
work could be judged from the high
degree of excellence attained in wood
carving by our Craftsmen in those
days. With the introduction of wooden

dolls the use of bright colours came
into practice. Colour15 a well marked
feature in most of the wooden dolls
and toys of India. More attention
is paid to the features of these dolls.
In some of the dolls from West Bengal,

or Bihar the outline of the form bears
a strOng resemblance to the case in

which an Egyptian Mummy is pre—
served—and that is perhaps the rea—
son——why they are sometime called

‘Mummy’ Dolls. While painting these
dolls the artists give full expression
to their love of colour and the forms
become more attractive and colourful

by the generous application of the
principal colours such as red, black,
blue and yellow. Most of these dolls

are ﬁgures of women and male ﬁgures
are rare. In the treatment of the
line old traditions are kept up and

they deserve special attention. I‘heir
main strength lies in the quality of
simplicity.

Great deal of economy is

praactised in giving these dolls shape
and

decorations.

The novelty of form and colour of
‘Pith’ dolls and toys has charmed the

minds of children in India for ages.
Produced in many parts of India by

‘Solakars’ or pith toy makers these
ﬁgures are made either by carving
out the solid pith or by joining the

different pieces together. As the co—
lours used on pith soaked into it they
give on the surface a rather unusual
soft tone which lends special charm
to pith toys. Some of these dolls
made in big size are often used for
puppet

dances in

rural

India.
