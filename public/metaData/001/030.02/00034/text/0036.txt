Besides these the village potter
also made at a later date, different
kinds of dolls from moulds. The

moulds some of which are still to be
found are very old and have been

used for generations.
Among these dolls, some show a

wonderful sense of humour.

The me-

thods adopted for making these dolls
are simple. According to the size of
the doll the right quantity of clay is
pressed on the mould which is coated
with sand. This coating helps the
ﬁgure to disconnect easily from the

original die. They are then kept in
the Sun and later baked or burnt
under ﬁre. Colour is then applied
and the dolls are sold at the local
fairs. The tradition of dolls and toys

is perhaps the most ancient among all
the handicrafts in India and there
are good reasons to

believe that it

any outside inﬂuences. It is perhaps
astonishing but true that some of the
toys that children played with as far
back as the fourth millennium BC.
have come down to children of our
time almost in the same shape and
form. This does not mean that there
has been no changes or improvement

in the

toy-making industry.

Some

of the dolls of today are a far cry from

those of their origin though still made
by hand and with care in the cottages
and small work centres.
Rag Dolls in India have undergone tremendous improvement in recent years and the cloth dolls of today

are but the logical development from
_ what once the mothers made from

pieces of rags to turn waste into usefulness. It is said that in ancient
times when fathers made use of simple
tools to carve a ﬁgure out of a piece

was probably here that the artisans

of

understood the child’s mind and reac-

mothers made use of their nimble
ﬁngers and leisure hours to make
colourful dolls with odd pieces of
cloth. With inﬁnite patience they
sketched out features and ornaments
of these dolls with different colour
threads. Here perhaps was the beginning of what later in the modern world

tions deeply. Their range of production, therefore, did not stop at
static dolls—but extended even at a
very early date to action dolls, and
toys.

Human and animal ﬁgures with
oscillating heads and limbs amused

wood

to

amuse

their

children,

children of all times and therefore

came to be known as ‘Soft toys’ ideal

were widely popular. However the
talents of these craftsmen were used

for very small children to play. Today in India the ‘Rag’ dolls or dolls

not only to produce clay toys but

made of cloth are beautifully ﬁnished

metal toys also. A charming little
Ekke-Gari or a horse-drawn two—
Wheeled cart in copper which was
made in Harappa is an example of the
talent of ancient Indian Craftsmen.
The craft of toy-making in India
managed to escape to a large extent

to the last details of costumes of
different parts of India and jewellery.
These dolls have made their way and

have found a high position in the
world market.
