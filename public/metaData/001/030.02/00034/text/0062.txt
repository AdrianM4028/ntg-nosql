What then should be the right
method? That can only be decided if
we are clear about the objectives.
These should be as follows :
I. Acquirement of technical know—
ledge: Technical knowledge being un—
limited in scope, we have to set
certain limits. Within these limits, the
child should be able both to recognise
and execute certain forms. These forms

should be such as are familiar to all
and capable of easy reproduction.
If the child can freely use these forms
in different contexts in his work, he

will be said to have acquired sufﬁcient
technical skill.
2. The child should have some
idea as to how to use contrasting
colours and relative colours. This objective can easily be achieved if
the child is taught to study the dis—
tribution of these colours both in

Nature and in works of Art. An
eye for Nature would amply compen-

sate the lack of skill in reproducing
objects
from copy—books.
Given
Nature as teacher, we need no other
agency for imparting aesthetic taste
to the child.

The matter-of-fact critic may point
out that Nature could also be viewed
through the eyes of the scientist.
There is a world of difference between the artist’s view of Nature and
the scientist’s. The scientists botanise,
the artists enjoy. There are both
the scientist and the artist in the

child.

They need not be at logger-

heads.

What we have to aim at is to

reconcile observation with apprecia—
tion until at last the child discovers his
own particular line of interest.
