I am glad to know that the Children’s Little Theatre, Delhi, has
decided to bring

out a special Souvenir

on.

the occasmn

of‘ its

Annual Festival this year, thus punctuating the importance of the (,hlld

in national life.
As I have said elsewhere, the adage that ‘ ‘children are the wealth
of the nation" can neither be over emphasized nor too often repeated; for

it is on the well-being of children that progress dependsand the future
of mankind.

Therefore, too much cannot be done for children.

Portu-

natelv, the world is awakening more fully to its obligation towards
children, and more and more vital services are being released through both
governmental and voluntary effort. In laying stress on the. cultural
aspects of child’s life, the Children’s Little Theatre IS domg a Signlﬁcant
service to children, which well deserves public support and gratitude.

MESSAGE FROM SHRI N. N. BHOSE
President, Children’s Little Theatre

I am delighted to learn that Delhi C. L.T. is going to stage its Third
Festival in October. This indicates satisfactory progress, in tune with our
aspirations. I am sure the Festival will be great success, judging from the
all round enthusiasm that it has created and my own ﬁrm conviction
about the wonderful gifts of our little children. At the same time I would
like to remind our little friends that you are unconsciously building up
India of the future and a new world of joy and happiness which you are
already radiating all round. People, old and young, are flocking to you

and expect not only a few hours of enjoyment that you offer them but
that you will be our future ambassadors of peace and good will which
Mahatmaji’s India is striving for under the magnificent leadership of
Panditji.

My loving asis to you all.
