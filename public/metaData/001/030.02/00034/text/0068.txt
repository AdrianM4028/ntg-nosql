tired daddies
Daddies—when you come home
tired after the day’s work, relax over
a cup of invigorating tea. It will
soon drive your tiredness away
and make you look forward
to a pleasant evening enlivened

by the laughter of children and the
gossip of your
friends. Yes. tea
revives vou and so
revives the home! '
