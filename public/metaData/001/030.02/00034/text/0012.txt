MESSAGE FROM SHRIMATI INDIRA GANDHI
Patron, Children’s Little Theatre

I am glad to learn that the Children’s Little Theatre is well
established in Delhi and is now bringing out its own publication.
May every year bring fresh successes and greater opportunities to
spread joy amongst our children.

There is so much WOlk to be done in our country that most people
tend to rush around with grim faces. 'We need our children to remind us
that the greatest of God’s gifts is the gift of laughter.

May these happy

little ones be instrumental in spreading laughter and the appreciation of
all that is good and beautiful,
