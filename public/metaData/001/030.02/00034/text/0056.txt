ALTHOUGH today there is a
growing sense of the value
of education, there is naturally

much difference of opinion
with regard to its aims, objectives and method. This want

of unanimity is particularly
noticeable with regard to painting,

music and dancing and their place
in a system of education.
Hap—
pily, however, a large section of poeple
have now come to realise that the
teaching of the three R’s is by no means
the only or even the most important aim

of education. More and more stress
is being given to the individual needs
of the child and it is now recognised
by many that there should be provision
for media other than language for the

self—expression of the child.
Attempts are being made in this
country to overhaul the system of

education. The place of Art as an
integral part of education has now
been assured, especially in the sphere
of child education. This much—needed
reform is largely inspired by the latest
developments in the West where edu-

cationists and child-psychologists are
collaborating to bring about a change.

the old outmoded system, we should
incur a fresh debt by accepting new
ideas from the West, or we should
devise our own system in which these

ideas would be incorporated and na—
turalised.
"he answer is that there will have
to be some amount of imitation and
also some change according to our

circumstances.

Even if there has to

be some imitation, it should be selec—

tive and not

indiscriminate.

It will

be wrong to put the Western emphasis
on paraphernalia and to incur heavy
expenses over accessories for art-training. Nor should we over—empha51se
the contribution of the West in this

particular sphere because we can pro—
ﬁtably build up our system of Art
education on the tradition of aesthetic

training we have inherited.
