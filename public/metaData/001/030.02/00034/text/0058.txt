Let us try to illustrate the point.
Suppose Ram has drawn something

in the shape of a square: When he is
”But where are

the

wheels?”
He calmly draws four
circles and says: “Here they are”.

Now his elders know that the four
wheels of a cart cannot be seen all
together. But it will not do to point
out the fact to Ram because his im—
pression of the cart is associated with
its four wheels.

It will be a grave

error if the teacher at this stage begins
to explain the problem of scientiﬁc
observation. For we cannot expect the
children to take an adult View of
things; their sense of perspective is
different. That is why in pictures
drawn by children, objects are simply
put together and their relative sizes
are determined by the strength of
impression these objects produce on
the child mind. Ram’s elders should

be satisﬁed with the square and its
four wheels which for Ram signify
the cart. To try to correct Ram is to

destroy the truth of his impression.
There are many who will regard
this kind of training to be sheer

waste of time.

If a child is to do

something, let him do it well, they

will argue, there is no use wasting time.

This impatience is more marked when
a professional artist becomes a teacher.
The answer is that it is no good forcing

the pace of the child. In the process
of his natural growth the child will
of himself discover what the teacher
seeks in a hurry to impose on him.
I t will be a mistake to hustle the child

out of his own world of impressions.
And yet some help and guidance
must be given to him. The method

Another problem is training the
child in the use of materials and accessories of Art.

Here again it will be

a mistake to superimpose what we
call technical knowledge. In his urge
for self—expression the child will naturally come upon this knowledge and
make it his own. All that we can do
is to give him further impetus by mak—
ing various art materials such as
pencil, charcoal, crayon, watercolour,

oil colour and papers of different sizes
accessible to him. The result will be
nothing but good if the choice of
materials is left to him.
The idea that the child should

start first by drawing with his pencil
and later on with colours, is wholly
untenable. The dexterity which the
child will readily acquire through
handling of various materials,

may

not be acquired as quickly if he has
to go through the drudgery of using
the same material over a sustained

period. The process here is very
similar to story—telling in relation to
teaching the child how to read and
write. Stories serve to develop the
power of connected thinking in the

child while they sharpen his imagina—
tion. They help him also to increas:
his vocabulary and to learn the cor—
rect enunciation and use of words.
In the same way through handling of

a variety of drawing marerials, the
child acquires not only manipulative
skill but also learns the correct use of
the materials themselves.
