On return from America, the citadel
of materialism, I started writing SHISHU
BHOLANATH, just as a prisoner in a

dungeon on escape would rush to breath
the refreshing air of the Seaside. Only
when a man is imprisoned within the four
walls, can he discover that he needs the big

sparkling blue horizon for his mind. When
I was imprisoned within the domain of the
adults, I also found that that the child, in a

Ch i dren ’s

man’s soul, has for his playground stretched
far far in many realms. Thus in my imagi—
nation, I dipped myself in that realm of

children, I swam in the waves

of their

happiness to make my mind clean cool and
unfettered.”
