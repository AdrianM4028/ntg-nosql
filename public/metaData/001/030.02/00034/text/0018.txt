A CHILD IS NEVER BACKWARD !

“UNCLE look! I can play Mowgli
——just like Tootul—~—” chirruped a
six-year—old child bouncing like an
India rubber ball as I entered the noisy

training Centre where a large group of
little boys were rehearsing Kipling’s
Mowgli’s story with gusto. The scene
was where the monkeys were kid—
napping and carrying Mowgli across

the trees with whoops and noises
wan-IV

enough to send even the monkeys
crazy. On the set there were quite a
good number of fake trees with several

' .-

loops of ropes and rings hanging from
the ceiling and the boys were practis—
ing the antics of real monkeys by

swinging from one ring to another with
ease and grace. The little Mowgli,
a boy named Tootul was having the
time of his life. He was swinging in
real Tarzan fashion and what more,
gave one or two lusty yells like Tarzan
although it was not in the script.

“Oh ! Uncle look——” and I was
aware of two litttle arms hugging me
and calling my attention to what
appeared to the boy as the most im—
portant event in his life. And it
was indeed an enchanting sight for
me to look at the little ’un full of
fun and mirth.

by putting him on a swinging cradle.
With a whoop he swung clear and ended
up on the soft mat with a thud. He
was just another child! I looked at
him critically and my mind went
back to the day when Sujit—that
was his name—came to the cen-

tre clutching at his grandma.

the little kid came to the centre with

and jumped and crawled and shouted

an apologetic tone:
