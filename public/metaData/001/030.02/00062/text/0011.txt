‘Twas on a Monday morning,
Right early in the year,
When Charlie came to our town,

She was a ﬁshmonger, but sure 'twas
no wonder

The young Chevalier.

For so were her father and mother

Oh ! Charlie ..................

before ;
And they each wheeled their barrow
through streets broad and narrow,
Crying, Cockles and mussels, alive.
alive, oh !

As he came marching up the street,

The pipes play’ loud and clear .

Alive. alive, Oh ! ..............

And all the folk came running out

To meet the Chevalier.

Oh ! Charlie................

She died of a fever, and no one could
save her,
And that was the end of sweet Molly

With Highland bonnets on their Head दृ ,
And claymores bright and clear,
' They came to ﬁght for Scotland’s right,
And the young Chevalier.
Oh ! Charlie ..................

Malone ;

Her GhOst wheels her barrow through
streets broad and narrow,

Crying, Cockles and mussels; alive.
alive . oh !
Alive, alive. 0h !

Cockles and Mussels

The Sky Boat Song
Traditional Irish Song

in Dublin's fair city, where girls are
so pretty,

I ﬁrst set my eyes on sweet Molly
Malone.
'As she wheeled her wheelbarrow
through streets broad & narrow,

. Crying, Cockles and mussels ! alive,
'

alive. oh !

Chorus
Alive, alive, oh ! alive, alive oh !

This song is also about Prince Charles
Edward, who after the defeat of
his army by the Duke of Chamberlain

at Gulloden, made his escape to the
island of Skye on

his way to France
