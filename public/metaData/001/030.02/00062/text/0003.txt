WHAT IS CLT?

HOW DOES IT WORK?

CHILDREN have their own language

developed in the light of the child-

CXpressed in movement, rhythm
and jingles. It is feeling more than
ideas that they wish to express, and
their most natural form of selfexpression is through rhythm.
Many famous nursery rhymes are

material is published and passed on
to the schools.

The teachers cart

the Centres. CLT can help them
not only with the material, but with

little more than words strung to-

ideas on staging, decor, costumes

passed on from parent to child and
set to traditional tunes.

and presentation. The work of the
Centres and aﬂiliated schools culminates each year in a Children’s

made to ﬁnd the child’s own mode
of expression.
From dramatised
rhymes it is only a step to mimes,

sketches and musical playlets or

into the repertoire of CLT.
CLT works in two ways.

the children are gaining not only a
solid appreciation for what is beauti—
ful in music, drama and colour, but

they are learning to be useful cooperative citizens.
To compose the music and to provide the decor and costume design

and Art Sections which work alongside the Training Centres, and to
