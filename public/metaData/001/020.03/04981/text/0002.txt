ABOUT THE GROUP

ANANT or An Association for Nascent
Art and Natural Theatre, was registered in
1989. It took off with the stage production

of 'ALIBABA'- a Hindi adaptation of
Khirodprasad Vidyavinod's late 19th century classic Bengali play. This was followed
by a musical production of 'RAJA Kl KHOJ'.
Over the years, ANANT experimented
with diverse theatrical/dramatic forms.

These include :
A 'rhymatic' play in Bengali - 'CHHADA'
A 'collage' play - 'T’een Roy' - (Based on
the creations of three generations of
the Roy family namely Upendrakishore, Sukumar and Satyajit)
A narrative presentation - 'Badda' (The
translated and unedited rendition of
Munshi Premchand‘s story 'Bade
Bhaisaab'
'KATHOKATHAYEV AGOMONI' - A tale
woven around the legends of Goddess
Durga, presented in the traditional
'Kathakatha‘ style of Murshibad district,
West Bengal.
.
'ANANT‘ Opened its first children‘

theatre workshop in the summer of 1998.
The present productions are the results of

this workshop.
At the workshop, we tried to create an

atmosphere wherein learning (for both the
children as well as their parents) became
fun rather than anD imposition. We also
made an effort to understand and respond
to the nascent and natural aspects of

drama through the playful forms of rhymes
and traditional narrative styles.
ANANT has always aimed at exploring
the integral relationship between drama
and education. Because we firmly believe
that it is this relationship that enables the
child to open up to and socialise with the
outside world.
ANANT pledges to continue in its endeavour to explore newer territories of
theatre and associated art forms. We hope
our effort will rejuvenate the child within
you and open your eyes to the simple yet

beautiful things in life.
