AVANAVA N KATAMPA
A perennial enquiry of The rusTic mind inTo The
TruTh of life; i nTo The conTemporary social realiTies!

WhaT does The 'KaTampa‘ - (hurdle) represenT?

ls iT noT selfishness? IT is possible.
ls iT violence? ThaT Too is noT impossible.

Can anyone cross This and reach The world of
bliss and join The TesTiviTy तो The ecsTasy of life?
No man ever succeeds in crossing The KaTampa.
BuT, does This Tai l ure warranT elimi naTion of The concepT
oT divinity from our dreams?
Dreams musT noT be shaTTered, so ThaT man

would ulTimaTely succeed in crossing over The KaTampa.
IT is indispensable To mai nTai n The conTi n uiTy of l iTe and
human exisTence.
