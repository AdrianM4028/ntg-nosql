"Jo Ram Rachi Rakha" talks all about the oppressor and the
oppressed, the exploiter and the exploited, the haves and
have-nots the bourgeois and the proletariat. The play debunks the
power-politics of the sad, corrupt and degenerate feudal
establishment, and the evil machinations of the feudal lords.

In fact, it is like a folk tale standing on its head because unlike
other folk stories, it goes a step further by exploiting the irony
talent in the story. The play is about the rebellion for the people,
but neither by the people nor of the people. The. rebel, Manna
Seth son of a feudal land-lord, is as far removed from the common
man as can be despite his anti-establishmentarian‘ attitude.
The system the young man is pitted against is represented at
the level of the family by the father, the Big Seth, and at the
political level; by the king himself.
ironically, the very people Manna claims to be fighting for, benefit

the most from feudalism he is rebelling against. People like the two
Musahibs (traditional flatterrers) and Savitribai, do everything to
strengthen the establishment, Manna wants to rescue them from
With the innate, earthy wisdom of the exploited, they realize,
that for them security lies in casting their lot with the older seth
and the king rather than our swashbuckling hero despite his
attractive slogeneering. Understandably, the most puzzled soul
in the entire play is the poor Nandi, Lord Shiva's sacred bull
who has been sent as an emissary disguised as an ordinary human

being to this “Mritulok” (earth).

Lord Shiva and Parvati have an

argument over the merits and demerits of divine lnte ference in
this “Leela” of human beings. Parvati feels that Shiva can save
the situation but Shiva thinks otherwise, hence Nandi is
requisitioned to find the truth. Nandi is totally alien to the
set-up, has neither the idealism of Manna nor the cunning of the
establishment to understand the tussle. He departs as puzzled as

i

he came, and convinced that this entire "Leela" is of man's
own creation, and divine interference and guidance are myths.
