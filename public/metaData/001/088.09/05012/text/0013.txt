The Play

.
,
Kaala Meda Bhes is based on a real life incident that took place in Sindh, where a woman was
exchanged for an ox. The play tells the story of the woman, Sundri, who Ô¨Årst feels humiliated
at the exchange, then angry and eventually determined to prove her worth as a human being.
The play uses the folk theatre style of the primitive Swang theatre and is a bold attempt, both
thematically and in terms of style. The play is based in the Cholistan desert in South Punjab,
where drinking water is scarce and the local Pir controls the only well. The water is sold to the
villagers. Wassayah, in an attempt to break the monopoly, brings in water from a neighboring
village. The Pir has Wassaya's bull killed. Ditta, a poor peasant, ultimately manages to
discover water. Eventually the Fir is driven out and Sundri triumphs.
