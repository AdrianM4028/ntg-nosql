Ajoka and the Women's Movement
1983 was a turning point for the women's movement in Pakistan. On 12 February
1983,a women‘s demonstration against anti—women Islamization was brutally broken
up by General Zia-ul-Haq's policemen and several dozen women activists were
thrown in jail. They included activists Asma Jahangir, Hina Jilani, Feryal Gauhar and
Madeeha Gauhar.

Women's Action Forum had been formed earlier which gave a new life to the women's
movement across the country. Madeeha and some young theatre artists decided to
form a theatre group called Ajoka, committed to promote the cause of theatre for social
change.

Ajoka has been committed to the cause of women's emancipation from its very
inception. It's plays have addressed themes such as bias towards the girl child,
female education, family planning, honour killing, bride burning and rape. The plays
have been performed at women's conferences, workshops and village gatherings.
They have included comedies, farces and tragedies. The plays include:

* "Barri" (1987): The play is about four women in a prison cell and touches the issue of
discriminatory anti-women laws introduced by General Zia-ul- Haq. Shahid Nadeem
