in l 937 and went on to become the leading lady ofthe famous

It was when Ajoka introduced alternative theatre in Lahore
that Uzra decided to stage a comeback. She is now a leading

member of Ajoka and a source of inspiration for her younger
colleagues. She has acted in TV plays as well. She was
awarded the Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1995 by the
President of I ndia. Uzra and Zohra are sisters.
