In memory of

Khadijah Gauhar
( l 92 8—2 O0 3)

Khadijah Gauhar, was not
just the mother of Madeeha
Gauhar, Ajoka's founder.
She was also like mother to
Ajoka. She had the courage
and the vision for not only
encouraging her young
daughter to form a radical
theatre group during times
when General Zia-ul-Haq's
military rule was at its
oppressive peak, she also
offered her house lawn for
Ajoka's first production.
This was a time when no
hallowner was willing to let
Ajoka present an anti—
Establishment play. She was
always an enthusiastic
supporter of Ajoka and a
regular guest at every Ajoka
premier.
Khadijah was a dedicated
socialist, a fearless writer, a committed human rights activist and an untiring social
worker. She actively campaigned for an end to apartheid in South Africa and was a
passionate supporter ofpeace between India and Pakistan.

Khadijah was an active supporter of women's struggle for emancipation. This support
did not stop at writing articles on women's issues and portraying strong women's
characters in her novel (The Coming Season's Yield), she practically devoted a
signiﬁcant part of her life in working for the betterment of conditions for poor women.
She founded a Mother and Child Hospital in Skardu and would spend a major part of
Summer in Skardu, raising funds for the project and helping with the running of the
hospital. She did not cancel her visit to Skardu in spite ofill health and that was where she
died in July 2003.
Ajoka is proud to dedicate this festival to Khadijah Gauhar's cherished memory.
We know she would have been overjoyed at participating in an lndo-Pak theatre
festival on women's issues. Peace in South Asia, women's rights and quality
theatre, all these things had always been very close to her heart.
