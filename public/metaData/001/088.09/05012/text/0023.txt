The play

men sitting on judgment of their own women, who are accused of violating the tribal code of
honour. The Play is part of Aj oka's campaign to create awareness about the savage custom of
honour killing and mobilize public opinion for its eradication. The play is in Seraiki and has
been performed in South Punjab in areas where honour killing and Panchayat injustice is a
major human rights issue. The play has also been converted into a teleﬁlm "Jawaz" which has
been shown on Geo TV and at the Kara Film Festival 2003.
