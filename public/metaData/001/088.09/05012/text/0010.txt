The Play
Aik Thee Naani is inspired by the true life story of two extraordinary sisters, Zohra Segal and
Uzra Butt. They both started their careers in 1930s in Bombay and were associated with
Prithvi Theatre and Indian Peoples Theatre Association. After Partition, Uzra migrated to
Pakistan and Zohra stayed back. This play, specially written for the sisters by Shahid Nadeem,
brought them together on one stage after four decades. The play was first performed in 1993
and has since toured India twice and UK.
The play is about a grandmother (Naani) who visits her sister, the Daadi, who lives a quiet and

conservative life as a housewife. Their common grand-daughter becomes a bone of
contention. She wants to become an actress and the Daadi doesn't like that. But the Naani,
herself a veteran actress and dancer, subverts the conservative household and enables the

young girl to be what she wants to be.
