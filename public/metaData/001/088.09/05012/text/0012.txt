the best production for 1986-87. In 1999, the Utter Pardesh Sangeet Natak Academy

The Play

Antrayatra (inner journey) is a production based on an autobiographical solo play by
Ms Ganguli. It is about the signiﬁcant characters Usha Ganguli has played through the
years. These characters include Ibsen's Nora in ' A Doll's House', Wesker's Betty in '
Roots', Tagore's Vimala in 'Ghare Baire' and Mahashweta Devi's Shanichari in 'Rudali’.

There is a whole history ofIndian womanhood played out in a large enough social space
covering middle class homes in Guriya Ghar from 'A Doll's House' and Parichay from
Wesker's 'Roots' the urban working woman in 'Request Concert’ the working class
ﬁghter in the Gorky-Brecht Mother, the rural woman at the extreme margins in Lok
Katha and Rudali. All her women emerge as critics of life rising to a higher state of
realization as they grow within their plays and life.
