The theme of the festival is women. Women's rights and gender discrimination has always
been a major focus of Ajoka's work. This is no coincidence that a theatre group with a strong

commitment to social justice has become so closely involved with the women's movement. In
our society women have been in the vanguard of the struggle for human rights and democracy

and have always been the ﬁrst target of dictatorships & fundamentalist policies. The issues
addressed in the plays to be performed at the festival range from women's education and
honour killing to empowerment and peace. There is a wide variety in form and technique
showing the richness and power of South Asian theatre.

It is also signiﬁcant that some ofthe leading women directors from the region are participating
in the festival, Madeeha Gauhar and Sheema Kirrnani from Pakistan and Usha Ganguli and
Neelam Mansingh from India have made valuable contributions to socially-relevant theatre in

South Asia. Such women are role models for younger generations. Let us hope many budding
women directors and actresses will ﬁnd inspiration from this event and enrich the theatre scene
in a society where performing arts still have a stigma attached to them.
