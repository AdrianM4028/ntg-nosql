Sharam Di Gal/Dhi Raani
The Group
Aids Awareness Society (AAS) is a group of young people who work on AIDS/HIV
awareness. It holds workshops in schools to create awareness on the issue. AAS is presenting

two short plays Sharam Di Gal and Dhi Rani. Both are written by Shahid Nadeem and Ô¨Årst
performed by Ajoka.

The plays
The theme of Sharam Di Gal, is the insensitive treatment of rape victims in our society. It asks

the question that is being raped a matter of shame or the non-caring attitude of the police,
medical examiners, courts and the family ofthe victim more shameful?
th' Rani addresses the issue of discriminatory and unjust treatment of girls as compared with
boys, with special reference to education. If the son is bad at studies, does it mean that the

bright and studious daughter should be discouraged from higher studies. The question asked

is : should we feel embarrassed at giving education to our daughters or should we be proud of it.
