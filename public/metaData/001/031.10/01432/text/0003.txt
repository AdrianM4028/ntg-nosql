About the play ॰ Bolta Gadha is a play about an adventurous
Donkey with a gift of the gab as he sets offfrom Barbanki to Delhi.
The journey takes in all 6 months. On the way he lands up in the
middle ofa communal riot, peeks into the homes of three kinds of

children - one rich, one middle class and one of the slum - and
discovers that the whole lot are miserable in their own way.

the gift of speech. The play ends with a bray.

A WORD FROM A YOUNG DIRECTOR :
UTKARSH MARWAH, TEL : 4697677

lfeel honoured in calling myself a young Director bu t this honour
has been granted to me by my elders who have helped me. I
realised that a child has endless creativity and needs a gentle and
sympathetic nudge to bring this quality to the for'efron t. I realised
this and have utilised this to bring the best the artists have to
offe r.

Nobody in the World can stand alone, leave aside talking of
marching ahead on one ’s own . My young colleagues have made all

efforts to make today’s event a success. My underlying and
everpresen t gratitude to these young friends.

Lastly, I would be failing in my duty and responsibility if I donot
thank the people who have helped backstage and the instituting
and encouraging response of parents and friends.
