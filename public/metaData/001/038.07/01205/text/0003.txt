Rang - Vasundhara, a theatre group has been formed in the capital b’y‘yo‘TrTLg—and—e-nthu '
workers, closely associated with the theatre movernnt. One of our aims is to present good and
meaningful theatre which portrays directly the socio-economic and political environment of the time.
We have taken a step ahead to adopt and imbibe the traditional and folk forms of our country into
modern theatre' to give it a new meaning. The group has performed the following three Hindi plays
since i ts inception with much success :

i)

Shant Sagar Mein Ek Roz …- It is an original Hindi play, written by Rameshwar Prem, a wellknown play-wright and a contemporary poet, and directed by Satyabrata Rout.

ii) Mahanirvana — The play is originally written in Marathi by Satish Alekar and translated into
Hindi by Dr. Vasant Dev, and directed by Satyabrata Rout.
iii) Rashomon — This is an stage version of a well-known Japanese film by Akiro-Kurosawa,

translated into Hindi by Dr. Ramesh Chander Shah, and directed by Satyabrata Rout. In this
play, we have tried to interweave elements of ’CHHAU', a martial art of Orissa into the theatrical
representation to give new dimensions to both the forms.
