I am glad to know that South
Kanara Club, New Delhi, since its
inception in 1970 has been bringing
to the delight of Delhi's Kannadigas
and to the admiration of others the
rich and varied art & cultural heritage of Karnataka and now, in keeping

with their objective, are inviting a
troupe from Udupi to present on 5th
and 6th October, 1984 the ancient
performing art of the State, 'Yakshgana'. Exchange and display of such
'
cultural activities help in their
promotion and are a step towards
national integration. While expressing my appreciation of the objective

of the Club, I wish for the success
of the Yakshagana Festival.
