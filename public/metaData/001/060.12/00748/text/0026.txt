Veerendra Heggade is no doubt a unique institution.
The scheme of mass marriages has now become
popular throughout the land. It has helped in
reducing indebtedness among the poorer sections and
has proved a deterrent to the evils of the dowry
system as well as the caste and social inequalities.

In order to help people in conducting marriages
Shri.

Heggade

has built a

number of Kalayan

rnantaps (Wedding Halls) at a number of centres in
Karnataka.
In addition to the traditional charities,

Shri,

Heggade donates clothes to thousands of women
twice every year. Help is given to the poor by distributing f'oodgrains gr0cery and edible oils. His
notable gesture in this direction was the adoption of
all the families of the weaker sections in the Belthan—

gady Taluk to commemorate the installation of the

Bahubali statue in Dharmasthala.

Another scheme of far— reaching importance
launched by the Dharmadhikari is that of "Village
Development and Self employment". A pilot centre
has already been set up under the Manjunatheshwara
Temple's auspices at near-by Ujire. The potential
of this scheme in generating employment and stemm~
ing the exodus of the rural unemployed youth to
towns and cities has been appreciated all around.
Two nationalised banks have already come forward
to help in expanding this scheme.

The consecration of the 39 foot monolithic
statue of Bahubali on Ratnagiri hill at the portals of
Dharmasthala has added to the lofty multi dimensional spiritual grandeur of Dhamasthala. It was the
culmination of the fond dream of Shri. Ratnavarma
Heggade translated by his son with undaunting and
exemplary zeal. If the carving of the colossus from
a mass of granite was an archtectural marvel, shifting
the masive statue over a distance of 64 kilometres
from Karkala over difﬁcult terrain and across bridges
to Dharmasthala was a saga in transportation engineering. The ceremonial installation of Gommateshwara Bahubali in February 1984 at this conﬂuence
of faiths was hailed as an epochal event. The
Dharmasthala Bahubali—the fourth of the great
in Karnataka quartet now stands atop the hill beckoning pilgrims as the sentinel of India’s eternal
message of tolerance, compassion and peace !
