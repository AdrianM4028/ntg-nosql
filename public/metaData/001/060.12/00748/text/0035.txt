the professional a'tiste, because it has alone a few
agile jumps on the stage. There is excessive eulogy

In Bombay where a substantial portion of

Dakshina Kannada Yakshagana forms live, it is said a
succesful Bhagawath actor will be garlanded with rupee

tion in an environment bereft of passion. Good lot
of scholariﬁc work remains to be done into the traditional theatre. For example yet, there is no substantial
history of the performing troupes. There is no pro-

Good for the Bhagavath surely, but what

good for Art? Again, we manifest love in rural
style even though the performance is in Shanmu—
khananda Hall. And then by God, there are the

inﬁnite round of ‘Sanmanas' (honouring function to
artistes) as if to compensete for the social neglect of
the artiste but really indicating a new mania
(Sanmania ?) of the public mind. An avalanche of
self-praise and Press controversies cannot save the
art of Yakshagana from the clutches of mob—elation
and amateurish product-mix.

There is great need for contemplation and reﬂec-

institutions like the Yakshagana Kendra with its
nexus with the
living theatre must work more
comprehensively art-situation. Going abroad is not
the summum bonum of existence. The real aim is to
provide institutional - focus _on this-luxurious rural
theatre. We take pride in the interest shown by foreigners. We should be equally proud of our own schol—
ars bend their energies to discover the truth. The
immediate goal should be to build a national centre
on lines of Cheruthurathri for Kathakali and
Kalakshetra for Bharata Natyam. The Govt. of
Karnataka and the Govt. Of India must take the
lead. Will they ?
