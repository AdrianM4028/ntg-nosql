Yakshagana the popular dance of Karnataka,
needs no introduction to art lovers. The revival of
this folk art has resulted in the increased interest
shown by women folk, especially

in some

cities.

women’s participation seems to be one of the latest
trends in the horizontal develprnent of Yakshagana.
This aspect deserves critical examination.

that the women were kept outside the world of Yakshagana. The form of Yakshagana art alsodiscourages
the feminine world. The vigorous dance style, the
elaborate and heavy costumes demand great physical
strength from the actors. The vigorous dance is
immediately followed by an externpore speech. A
woman will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to withstand the physical
strain of this art. The steps and postures of Yakshagana are manly in nature. Thus, conventional Yak—
shagana theatre has always been beyond the reach of
women. They participated only as spectators.

Later, certain actresses started taking up femal

roles in the Yakshagana drama itself. This bold step
was taken at ﬁrst by only one rnela (troupe). In the
story RAN I ABBAKKA, the queen’s role was played
by a woman. Even though this practice continued for
two or three years, it did not prove a success. The

audience soon realised that the actresses who came
forward to participate in Yakshagana were mediocre.
So, when the owners realised that the women brought no additional proﬁt, but added only additional
problems of maintenance, they soon gave up the
practice of engaging women in the troupesIn recent years many modern educated women took
up Yakshagana as a hobby. During the last ﬁve-six
years many lady employees of Banks have formed
and staged a few
their own amateur group,
Yakshagana shows. This has started a new trend
and today we have many Yakshagana lady troupes,
some by employed women and some by girl students.
In the beginning they played only the different
roles in the mummela' and the background music
and singing himrnela’ was supplied by men. But,
nowadays certain lady troupes try their own

When ladies started participating in company
draw, commercial Yakshagana also thought of
involving women. In the 1950’s certain commercial
Yakshagana troupes the ten melas which gave only
tickted shows-engaged women by arranging a small
dance programme before the actual beginning of the
Yakshagana. This did not help much in luring more

The achievement of these adventerous young women
can never be under-rated. However, it has to be admi—
tted that a full-ﬂedged Yakshagana performance by a
lady amateur troupe has its own limitations and
defects. The very basic masculine nature of Yakshagana is changed into feminine character. The male
roles, roles of demons and battle scenes are found
