Q. : What motivates you to choose this play ?

up a literary work from my own language and that was the
motivation to choose Mukundan's “Oru Dalit Yuvtiyute Kadana

Drama whether they could do it and was kind enough to take up
the project. That is the background.

novel depicts the agony of being a woman. Here, the work 'Dalit‘

know the humiliation meted out to Bhangwanti, accepts that
role and ironically ﬁnds herself humiliated and exploited in her
own actual life. Vasundhara evokes the images of Draupadi,

Sita, Medea.

monologues helped me in reinstalling the dramatic word which
includes the movement, the movement of the mind. The
