An open letter to animal olvers
If you have a pet, you know how wonderful and loving they can be. An
inseparable part of your family, they share your home, your food, your time and your
love.

But have you ever noticed the countless animals that roam the streets.

Left

amidst chaotic trafﬁc, inclement weather and some even crippled because of the

cruelty of some merciless people.
Each year thousands of animals suﬁer agonizing deaths in accidents.
Thousands more are subjected to the miseries of diseases that require prompt
medical attention. Still more starve for food and love.

And yet they do suﬁer and will continue to suffer unless and until you
decide to help.
Care for Animals is a new society of animal lovers who have decided to do
something for these mute, helpless animals. Care for Animals is a dynamic, action

oriented group of people who have decided to help in their own capacity — for nothing
but the kindness of their hearts.

80 if you feel you’d like to be part of this movement, and are willing to devote
some of your time, your ideas and your resourcesrpiease write—to us.

your help — because we Care for Animals.
