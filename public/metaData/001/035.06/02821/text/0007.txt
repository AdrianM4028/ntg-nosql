'You don't have to be a Musician . . .
You don't have to be a musician to create music: at least, that was our working premise

when we began work on the chorus at the end of THE VISIT.
premise was the beliei that music was a means of.communication
except, constructed with sound — and thus does not have to be
artistic-ideological traditions that have determined our conceptions
stitutes.

Underlying this
— like literature,
grounded in the
of what it con'

We started by breaking down the text of the chorus into a set of aural “building blocks"
the bizarre vocal duet that is heard at the beginning, the chiming bell motifs, the

“trafﬁc noise” percussion, etc. ~ and worked at building an ”architecture" with these
units of sound.
Simultaneously, vocal sessions were conducted with a group to create an awareness
of pitch, timbre, and texture. Simple percussion instruments, “clapping exercises",
etc., brought about an awareness of rythm and “time-space". Eventually, Carl OrﬁSchulwerke instruments were introduced, the use of which requires no prior instrumental training. Eventually, the entire “sound-architecture" was recorded and edited

to create the textures in the piece.

' The concept of composition with a group of “sound-architecture” led us to abandon a
lot of elitist ideological conceptions about “art"; many may be strongly critical of what
we have produced. If you have liked what we have done, remember, you can do it too:
and to hell with any so-called critics who claim otherwise.
