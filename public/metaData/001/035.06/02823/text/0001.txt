~ Over the past seven years, the Music Theatre Workshop has cOme to be known as '

almost an alternative educationalexperience in theatre and music for children. Since July ’86. '
V the older group of MTW members, all now in college, have started working separately from
the juniors and concentrating their energies on music appreciation, creative writing, play
analysis and direction, apart from improvisational work, music and movement, music compo-f .
sition and singing, play and poetry reading. and art work. Soviet playwright Vampilov's THE
LAST SUMMER is their first independent production.
. ३
Vampilov was a Siberian and he died in 4072- Apart from writing plays he also wrote
hUmourous stories. THE LAST SUMMER is not a typical Varr1p1|ov ‘play It shows signs of
something “Chekhovian”, a new Vampilovian interpretation of life, with more open lyricism,
bitterness, passion and the simplicity of a parable. Although the tangle of passionand action,

,

in this play seem to be inepired by love—THEV LAST SUMMER is definitely not sOlely "
concerned w 1'th t hi 3 emotion.

The cast includes:
Anubha B‘anerji, Ashwini Rao, Charu Ahuja, Jagan Shah, Jatinder Singh, Mandeep

Bhander, Natasha Tawadey; Sanjeev Singh, Shailen Tuli, Shuddhabrata Sengupta.
