LIFE
Deepu, Shekhoo, Adarsk, King.
The sunlight
Filters through the leaves
Like a thousand puzzles...
The sunlight
Coloured by the leaves,
Flows out in all directions
Life
That brings new hope
That stops and breathes
In the serene silence of the forest.
(a procession of forest peopleâ€”cane.
acacia, almond, . .. )
The sunlight
Filters through the leaves
Like a thousand puzzles
Life, swinging free from a tree
Blooming from the fertile ground
Swirling in the rapid waters ..

THE FOREST PEOPLE
The birds make their
homes in the leaves,
They sing sweetly,

cane, berry
acacia, almond
bamboo banyan,

When the day dawns.
They wake us and call in
the new day

magnolia, jasmine

blackberry, olive

Listen to them.
Cut the grass with,
your hands and take

apple, bean,

it home

mango, aloe,

grape, pomegranate

separate the strands,

amber, sandalwood

weave a mattress,

silk-cotton,
betel- n ut.

make a bed and go
to sleep, tired
When the night falls.

berry,
