Who are you and where do you come from ?
Tell me your names...

What is your crime ? What are you charged With 7’

। am Deepu, this is Shekhoo. .
We are performers...
We live in this city
We stay together and earn our living,
We perform a ‘Nautanki’ song on the streets
Dress ourselves up and tell tall tales.

Deepu

We tell stories, but in those stories,
We tell the truth, not what is false.
One day we were telling such a story,
I am telling the truth, we were telling the truth.

Shekhoo

They called us liars and dragged us away...

A d a rs h

Let it be... I know what's next.
(/ai/or's laugh)

Deepu

Who are you? Where do you come from .7

Shekhoo

Tell us your names too
We told you, now it‘s up to you.

Ad a rs h

I am Adarsh . . . and he is one of the forest people...
He can’t speak.
He uses signs to communicate.
(interpreting for the tribal)
'l live in the forest beyond the city",
l was picking leaves for my cows
when he caught me and took me away..."
My story is also somewhat like yours...
। am a poet, writing is my profession,
I always tried to write the truth,
someone up there did not like this.
Perhaps I came too close to reality...

Deepu
Sh e k h oo

We also know what happens next.

You think I am the ja-ilor’s dog...
That । run wherever I see a scrap of food,
But I know this much, and i tell you this,
l can't fill my empty stomach with your high ideals.
So I stay away from your kind
(the king is brought in)
The King ..... Here .7

No, I’ am not the king of this country...
Here I am just a small little prisoner...
Just this door separates the king and the prisoner
...
The door opens at one sign from them .. lt closes
at another
They do as they like
They keep me like a puppet on a string...
