What kind of place was this ?
Where one and all were paralyzed with fear?
How things have changed.
No we won’t call this place Besura Desh again
Whatever was here is
Still the same in other places.
What ?
,
And if it gets too late then they too can all become like...
Besura Desh.
Now that you've seen this place come and tell us how you feel
About that
What will happen here now ?
Will we see a return to Besura Desh again ?
Freedom they now have _
How will they use it ?
Only time will tell,
But never again will we let this became...
Besura Desh.
People Come to work
People 90 to work.
But look—now everybody goes,
None stay back and Iaze at home,
Eating what they haven't earned .
Nor do they preach
To the workers and
Everyone sings in harmony.
Listen
We'll sing for you...
