BhoIa

Shhh. Sound travels far at night 1
Go and listen do you hear footsteps .7
Hide under the shade of the banyan tree at the corner.
Tell us of danger with a cuckoo bird's cry.
One cry—the coast is clear,
Two cries—They're coming near.

They've left 1

A da rsh

I knew that they'd never be able to find us,
Try as they might, they'll never succeed.
No one can stop us,
When we sing together...
Then but

Choru s

A sleeping world of sleeping people,
Besura Desh.
Who will come to wake them up ?
Besura Desh !

Ki n g

How open, how wide is the sky,
How vast. how endless.
For if one were to reach for the stars,
One would never stop.
Tonight I want to tell the sky, the moon, the stars
All I've ever wanted to.
Tonight, I want to sing
All that I’ve never sung before.
Before .7
Where was all this before ?
If only they hadn't taken this vision from me...
If only they hadn’t hidden the sky from me...

Deepu

Where there wont' be shackles on our feet...
Tell me, where is such a place?
Where there won't be seals on our lips...
It is there that we have to go.

Ada rs h

(interpreting for the tribal)
So what if I'm not the same as you .7
I can laugh just as you do
I laugh as I touch the cool breeze,
For now I can return to live with it again !
