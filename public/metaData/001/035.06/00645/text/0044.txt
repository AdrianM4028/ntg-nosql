Once the soil is gone it is very hard to grow
trees, and it takes a long time for the soil to
build up again.
But the contractor refused to listen to them and
told his men to cut the trees. Then the women
of Mandal remembered what other Garhwali
women han done long ago when facing the
same problem. They told the contractor that
they would hug the trees, and by putting their
own bodies between the axes and the trees save
the trees. The contractor knew that he could
do nothing and went away.

Several weeks later the same contractor tried

More and more people heard about what these
brave women had done and they decided to do
the same if anybody tried to cut their trees. So
when, the next year, another contractor tried to
cut trees in a village called Reni, 65 krns from
Joshirnath, the women there stopped them.
They knew how important the forest was for
them to live, and they sang :—

-'This forest is our rnother’s home,

We will protect it with all our might."

harming anything. The govt. must have thought
that when it planted pines after cutting down
hill oaks in Chamoli. The hill people can use
the oak to make their plows, and they can also
feed its leaves to their cattle. The kind of pines

Chipko wants to save the forests because trees
are so important—they give us fresh air to
breathe, they hold the soil together so that it is
possible for water to seep into the earth to the
underground reservoirs and does not have to
flow away with the soil. And Chipko wants the
forests to be kept for the hill people who need
them to survive, and not taken away from them
by the govt. or anybody else. Not by cutting
down trees, not by enclosing them and declaring
them out of bounds to the people.
As well as organising people to stop the cutting
of trees, Chipko has organised a program in
which thousands of trees are planted—and
many people from the cities are helping them to
do this, becanse in the long run it is as impor-

tant for the city people as for the Garhwalis.
