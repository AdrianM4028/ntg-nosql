Director’s Note

' Our production this evening attempts to expand the idea of children' s
theatre from that of escapist fa Iry-tales of the past to one that will reflect,
through a young person's eyes, not only a critical look at the present, but

also a vision of.the future:

'

'

We started Work on Besura Desh in March, and over the following months,
_ through improvisation and discussion, the story one you see before you
emerged. Different individuals from the Chipko Movement, Kalpavriksh,
and Other such agencies; people who had opted to live with the tribals,

' films from UNICEF, reading material, newspaper articles and simulation
games all helped us familiarise ourselves with the themes. The concern
over the economic and ecological exploitation that the play speaks of are
therefore subjects that the workshop participants have selected
themselves, and given shape to through the choice of meaningful

. Symbols. These include the Council of the Free, where freedom beoomes
a Commodity to be sold to the highest bidder, the sewers in which the
poor live, the tribal world of harmony with nature in the forest
‘
' characterisation has emerged through word association by all workshop

participants, and the dialogue written entirely by the cast. A large number
of the song ideas were also created by them, their final shaping into lyrics
‘being, done \by Sal il Kurnar, an -ex—l\/ITW participant, now a first year
_ _ college student.

With the inclusion of some of the background material, that went into the
play, in this brochure, as Well as ideas for fol low-up action on its themes
we hope you will get enthused enough to insvolve yourself with what this

‘ play is about.
