THE ART 0F

(A tale of everything and everyone)
lrnagine the history of the Earth as one month (one day being 150 million years),
human beings in their present form (homo sapiens) have only been here for a minute
or so.
The Ecosystem is the complex web linking animals, plants, air, water, and every other
life form in the biosphere. It all hangs together. The System IS in a steady state of
dynamic balance, which means that by altering any one part you affect all the others.
Humans are only one factor in the ecosystem. But we don't qurte see it that way. We
set ourselves apart and call all the other factors or species natural resources-or srmply
n at u re .

Human survival depends upon preserving the ec03ystem. It’s the boundary of
existance, the framework of human activity. The ec05ystem can do wrthout us, but
we can't do without the ecosystem. As long as we live on Earth.

Nature knows best.

Until capitalism set about
industrialising society, nearly

80% of all the things used
by humanity came from the

animal kingdom,

and 20‘70

from the mineral kingdom.

Industrialism reversed the
trend-concentrating on the
Earth's store of non-renewa~
ble energy and materials,
such as fossil fuels and mineral ores.

Industrialism switched the
emphasis from the reproductive use of the resource base,
which leaves it in tact, to
extractive use, which reduces
the total store Humanity
began draining the Earth’s
'capital’ instead of living off
the interest.
