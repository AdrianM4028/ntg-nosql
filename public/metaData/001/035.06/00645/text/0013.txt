Mr. Expert, tell us of the situation.
In our great country, of what the condition is...

E xp e r t

In the last two years there were only two hundred strikes...
As usual the schools and factories were locked...
There was mud in the villages, sewers in the cities,
A hundred were dying from the stench , . .

K u bu dd h i

Let them die for the progress of MAN !
They don't do anything otherwise. . let them
Do their bit this way...

L a n d l 0 rd

Give them a taste of the stick, । say...
That will rid them of their obstinacy' 1
They'll crawl at our feet,
And bring compensation besides...

H a s h i sh

If you ask me, । will tell you...
How the problem is solved...
How wayward people return to the PATH
Through the medium of GOD... 1

D u rm a t i

He who wins the blessings of Lakshmi,
Has solved all problems ..
He who worships Lakshmi,
Never dies from any stench...
He who has beheld the goddess' wonders
Has seen all the beauty of the world...

If I may, your highness, there's one thing I'd suggest.
in imported solutions your country should invest
Come buy the very best and put it to the test 1
And hey presto, you’ve got it !
Don't leggo because it's ..
