BES[IRA DESH
What kind of a place is this .7
It seems as if you haven't seen it before...
Speak a little softer there !

!
Don't you know where you are ? This is Besura Desh
Here, at every turn, stop, look behind you, or else...
Or else ?
Or else you'll never know what might happen to you and when.
For this is Besura Desh !

People come to work
People go to work
But not everyone
Some stay and work at home,
Enjoying what they haven’t earned,
While preaching humanitarianism
To those who work and l and ! and l
The rest stay silent,
Come, we'll show you.
What sort a place is this .7
If you look carefully around you’ll realize
You’ve seen this sometime earlier.
Listen to what we have to say l
We know, we’ll tell you—what Besura Desh is.
The people up there, are doing...
Are doing ?
Are doing what they like with the people down here,
And there is no one to go and stop them...
For their’s is Besura Desh !
Don't work, you fools,
And then you will starve...
But if you live in fear of us,
Look after us well,
Keep us satisfied,
Then maybe in your next birth you'll be reborn better people...
Till then, stop, stay right where you are !
These are Kubuddhi and Durrnati
They are ministers, their word is law...
Bow low as you look upon them,
Obey their commands
३
For in their hands is the fate of Besura Desh...
The little king—
He quietly looks on...
Looks on .7
Watches the people up there doing as they like,
and that is why,
This is called Besura Desh !
Shouts, screams, power, wealth,
Disgust, abuse, regrets, bondage,
Comfort, Prestige, Dejection, Suffocation,
Success, Fear, hunger, Fatigue,
respect !
A defeatist

: This is my 'fate', this is how I'll live and how I'll die... Anything better
is a distant dream. . How will I ever fulfil it ? Now I am almost used to
it... What does domg anything achieve 7 I will stay just as I am.
