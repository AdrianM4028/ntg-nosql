DESTR UCTIVE DREAMS
D u rmati

Exalted, uncountable, irrepressable, unforgettable, Glory to the Goddess.
What is man before her ?
Ask what the future holds, the devotee will tell you...
the whole country, is like a temple
A temple of gold with silver steps.
The statue of the Goddess on a diamond throne.
Pilgrims come from afar,
carrying sackfuls of offerings.
Which are whisked away (with the Goddess' permission, of course)
And are distributed for the devotees welfare.
In a corner of the temple will be tiny little me.

So, Glory to Ourmati-ji
Glory to Lakshmi ji
Glory to Durmati-ji
Glory to Lakshmi-ji
I dream of a beautiful tomorrow...
it will come for I will bring it
In my hands, a small toy,
with coloured buttons
Press the black, the population falls.
The yellow one makes a city vanish.
When the red one dances, a mushroom cloud erupts.
lt explodes the smoke spreads. ३
Listen-to some one marching through it.
(troops come marching in)
One two, one two one two one two

Ku bu dd h i :

Troops
Kubuddhi:
Troops

Kubuddhi:
Troo p s

You are my troops, go tell the entire nation.
One two one two
If someone doesn't agree, drag him down.
one two one two

Kubuddhi:

Cut out his tongue before he can speak.

T ro o p s

one two one two

Kubuddhi:

If need be. water the land with blood.
This is my golden tomorrow,
This will be my age of the future
The next step is to start conscription.
To establish a dictatorship of my description.
To build the temple, invite the Goddess,
Fell the forests to raise funds for her welcome.
But...
But...

If the army comes, where will the Goddess go ?
It the Goddess comes she won’t like the army...
Wait
Don't loose your temper yet.
If you think carefully, then,

you’ll find that both of us are on the same track;
D u rmati

Ku bu d d h i :

The army can sing the Goddess’ bhajan
Oh yes.
Oh yes.

P- T

Oh yes

K- D

The temple must be built. the army must be stregnthened
For all this we require a human sacrifice...
Build the army, cut the trees.

P- T

Build the army, cut the trees.
