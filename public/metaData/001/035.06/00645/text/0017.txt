What is Freedom ?

Daspu

Why do you sit by yourself in a corner ?
What are you thinking ?
Maybe I know the answer to what’s bothering you.

King

Really ?

D eepu

Speak. ‘

King

Everything.

D e epu

But why? Don’t you trust me?

King

No-l don't even trust my own thoughts.
Why is it,

I’m scared.

that I can't walk away from the path which takes me
From the palace to the jail...?
That I can't speak. And when I do, nobody is listening 7.
They give me commands,
Make me give commands,
Some of which I hate,
Overs I don’t even understand.
Is it wrong to think ?
D eepu

N o , never.

Ki n g

As far as I can remember, that's what I was told.
Then why do I feel that there is something
Which will answer all my questions once I find it ?
ls that a foolish dream of mine ?

Deepu

Freedom!

Mng

What’s that ?

Deepu

When you find it, then you’ll understand.

ng

Where will I find it?

Deepu

Not here, when you go outside...
Look there, you’ll find it.
Beyond these walls;...
Far from the city.

Ki n g

What does it look like ?

Deepu

Like the sky.

Ki n g

What does it feel like ?

Deepu

Like the wind...

And then I won't have to tell you.
