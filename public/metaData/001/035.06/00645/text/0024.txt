The breeze is gently-gently blowing along,
Listen, just listen to it singing its song.
The song it is singing is ages old,
And we mustn’t let it go untold
Extend it and bring it to every home.
When this gentle breeze has been made into a storm
It will wake the sleeping people
And bring this song to every ear.
This gentle breeze must be made into a storm...
And the unjust must be made to reform !

Chorus

A sleeping world of sleeping people.
Besura Desh !
: - Someone go and wake them up...
Besura Desh
Let them sleep, don't wake them now !
Let them sleep, don't walk into danger.
The time will come, Go now and return
Show them all what is true and what is false

The Dawn approaches
We are very tired.
But we have to escape into the dark
For they are sure to chase us !

This leavetaking is not a failure, it is a victory.

When we return, we can sing together
The music of harmony.
