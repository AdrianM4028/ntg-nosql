A Worker’s Speech to a Doctor
BR E CH T

We know what makes us ill.
When we are ill we are told

That it's you who will heal us.
For ten years, we are told
You learned healing in fine schools
Built at the people's expense
And to get your knowledge
Spent a fortune.
So you must be able to heal.
Are you able to heal ?
When we come to you
Our rags are torn off us
And you listen all over our naked body.
As to the cause of our illness
One glance at our rags would
Tell you more. It is the same cause that wears out
Our bodies and our clothes.
The pain in our shoulder comes
You say, from the damp; and that is also the reason
For the stain on the wall of our flat
Fortes have holes and the birds of the air have their nests, but the

SO tell us '

children of Calcutta know not where to lay their heads. (Earthscan/

Where does the damp come from ?

Mark Edwards)

Too much work and too little food Makes us feeble and thin.

Your prescription says :
Put on more weight.
You might as well tell a bullrush
Not to get wet. ,

How much time can you give us ?
We see; one carpet in your flat costs
The fees you earn from
Five thousand consultations.

You'll no doubt say
You are innocent. The damp patch
On the wall of our flats
Tells the same story.
