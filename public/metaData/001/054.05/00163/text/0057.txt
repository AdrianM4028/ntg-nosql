Once in a while in every sphere a
revolution occurs. The Pi/Ot HiTeCpoint is such a revolution in
pens. A result of Japanese microtechnology, the difference is
obwous. The finest line ever
written by a pen~only 0.3 mm
Wide. Uniform flow which makes
your pen glide across the page.
Contoured to fit your hand
perfectly. And available in Black,
Blue, Red and Green colours,

And how does this pen, brought
to India by Luxor, and
manufactured in their
sophisticated plant in New Delhi
do all this? A microprecision
rolling bat/4 inside a unique
stainless steel flow tube makes up
your superfine Hi-Tecpoint tip,
This marvel of Japanese
technology is what makes your

superfine letters glide so
effortlessly across the page for
more than 7 . 500 metres.
