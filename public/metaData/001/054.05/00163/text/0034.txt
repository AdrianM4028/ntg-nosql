As for Tarang '84-it was high tide all the way-right from the moment our guests
arrived-young people from 12 different places to the moment when it ended to the strains
'
of the music for ‘Kamaini'-the dance-drama.
We have been working on Tarang '85 for a long time-being swept on a wave of
excitement to surface at Tarang. What do you see at Tarang? Competitions of a very high
standard going on while people from different colleges meet each other; get to know each
other. They play ‘Spoon and Potato Race' and gather items for 'Flea Market’.

Outside, the unruly mobs clamour to come in but they are not allowed to cross the
sacred portals of L.S.R. In the evenings. after the din of the day. they settle down to watch
a famous artiste perform. After 'party’ is over. the outstation teams sit on the lawns.

chatting, and you can hear the strums from a guitar and some crazy, off beat song in
the night.
Let us hope that we can promote 'Tarang' from a mere rendevous (no pun intended)

for giggling boys and girls flocking to the icecrearn eating competition to a place where we
can give our creativity and talents free reign.
