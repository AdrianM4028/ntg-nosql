Principal's Message
Tarang is here again, and with it is the experiencc of that irresistible buoancy,
that infectious spirits of Youth

.... ..

A great deal has happened on the national scene since we gathered here last year in

the midst of similar f'estivities; some events have been sad and disquieting; but perhaps
the most positive factor to have emerged f; om it all has been that the Youth has moved

to centre-stage in the life of this nation.

This naturally brings with it an added responsi-

bility... ....... ..the responsibility to evolve a culture, a new ethos that is a sensitive and

reﬁned blend of the traditional and the new, and that casts aside prejudice and hostility.
I believe that we should see ‘Tarang’ in such a light-as the resurgence of new wave. a
new spirit.

There are so many out station teams from different parts of India that have come

here to participate in this festival.

This provides us with a unique opportunity to

interact, to learn and to grow together, to lay the foundations for a truly new kind of
cultural exchange, by bringing to all the competitive events a more reﬁnd integrity, a

broader world-view, and a new commitment to the pursuit of excellence in all ﬁelds.

May Tarang begin by building the bridges for this exciting journey !

I wish you all the very best.
