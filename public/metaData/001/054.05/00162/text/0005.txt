Just decide on how much you
would like to save every month, and
for how long. Once you start on it,
you'll be surprised how easily savings
grow and earn interest too.
If you want to make it still simpler,
all you do is open 3 Savings Bank
Account at the State Bank, and
instruct yOUr Branch to transfer a fixed
amount to your Recurring Deposit
Account every month.
You can save in multiples of Rs. 5
for convenient periods. The rate of
interest for 12, 24 and 36 months is

%, for 37, 48 and 60 months 8%.
and for 61 , 72, 84, 96, 108 and
120 months 1 ‘32) pa.
What's more, your money moves
with you wherever you go. Because
