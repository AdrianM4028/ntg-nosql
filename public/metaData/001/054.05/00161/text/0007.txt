About the production . . . .

The year is 1942. In Nazi occupied Amsterdam, Anne Frank, her parents and her sister,
along with four other people go into hiding to avoid intensified persecution of the Jews. In
the sealed off back rooms of an office, for two years, this group of people lead an unusual
life fraught with tension, fear and scarcity. In 1944 they were caught. The families were
seperted and sent to different concentration camps, All perished. except Anne's father

Otto Frank, who died a few months ago.
Anne’s diary which was discovered by accident reveals an astonishingly intimate record
of their strange life over two years. Touching and humorous it reveals her unfolding into
womenhood: her yearings, her aspirations! her falling in love; and inspite of the horror
and the suffering, her unshakeable faith in the human spirit.
