the winners and the runners—up. It also conducts cards competitions on similar
lines .

The Club possesses a Library which now consists of more than .900 books
representing the rich and varied heritage of the Bengali Literature and its modern
developments.
The Club arranges periodical literary sittings to promote creative literary
activities amongst its members and others. Celebrations are also held with great
enthusiasm to mark the occasions of national and cultural importance in which
songs, music, dances, recitations and so forth form regular features.
The Club has also [aid adequate emphasis on the important role ofDrama
in the cultural life of the community. During the period 1950—56, it has staged,
mostly with local artistic talent, 19 plays, some of them more than once to meet
the popular demand.
