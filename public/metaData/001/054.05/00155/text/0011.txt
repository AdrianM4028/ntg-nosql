THE HINDUSTHAN SPORTS AND CULTURAL SOCIETY
There are many cultural organizations in Delhi and everyone is interested
in one or the other. One may, therefore, naturally ask if there is any scope or
necessity for a new organization. The answer is that this metropolitan city is
inhabited by the most cultured and educated people from different parts of India
and abroad. As cultural activities are the best forms of recreation to such
people, almost everyone is directly or indirectly associated with these cultural
organizations. One generally ﬁnds, however, that such cultural associations are
restricted to certain groups ofpersons. This restriction is often so great that it
inhibits members of one group from becoming interested in another group.
Consequently, we do not get an opportunity to know each other in the cultural
sphere.

The language of a particular community may diﬁer from that of another.
But if we pursue the matter further we ﬁnd that the basic principles as well as
the aims and objects of dzﬂerent cultural organizations are the same. There is
unity amongst diversity on the platform of culture.

It is with this great and noble idea that the Society has been making a
sincere attempt to form a common cultural and social organization which will
remain open to all classes and communities of the cultural world without any

restraint and restriction whatsoever.
from all complexes.

It may be called a cosmopolitan club free

In the course of the last two years of this organization, the Society has
had the opportunity of holding variety programmes on Baisakhi, Holi and
Buddha j’ayanti inviting artists from diﬂerent communities and from different
parts of India and abroad.

The Society has also earned a good name as a Theatrical Organization by
staging in August last, the well—known classical drama “Bijoya” in Bengali by
the late Sarat Chatterjee.
