KAR APRADHE

produced by MANIK ROY

This is a tragedy in which the sins of thoughtless parents are visited
upon their children, whom society, ever cruel and vindictive, shall not spare.

Shyam Shanker Chowdhury was efﬁcient at controlling his business but
had no control over his passions. Sabita, his faithful wife, had to bear up
with his selﬁshness and loathsome behaviour in accordance with the laws laid

down by society, which favours a man be he ever so evil, but fails to forgive
a woman her smallest weakness.

However, when she found him installing his mistress in her home as a

second wife, she tried to take her own life in despair, but was persuaded to
desist from such a terrible attempt by Somnath, an ardent follower of her
husband. Somnath took Sabita and her new-born infant under his wing and
offered them his home and protection. In due course Sabita and Somnath
began to live together as husband and wife. The years rolled by. Sabita
had now borne Somnath two children, a son and a daughter. Somnath had
established himself well and was a dutiful husband and affectionate father.

Shyam Shankar, on the other hand, had not met with much success.
Soon his mistress died, leaving him a daughter, who was his only comfort.
Burning with envy and hatred, Shyam Shankar vowed to destroy the happy
home Sabita, his wife, and Somnath had built together.

As was expected, the children, now grown up, would no longer
be kept away from the true facts concerning their parents relationships
towards one another. They left the pure world of childish innocence to
enter a strange and squalid one, victims of their parents’ lack of restraint_
Sabita ﬁnally paid the price of the folly of the two men by her life. But
what lay in store for the Children? Were they to remain omcasts
deprived of all sympathy and honour or would they be accepted once more

by the world as being innocent of the sins of their parents?
