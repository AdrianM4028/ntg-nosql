JAMIA DRAMATIC SOCIETY

D OOS RI S H AM

written by M. MUJEEB

“Doosri Sham” records the events of two evenings in an artists’ studiositting room. One might call it a character play, vividly reflective of human
moods and emotions, revealing the delicacy of the difﬁcult subject of human
relationships.
It is distinguished by contrasts of extremely deep and rich,
yet restrained expressions of feeling with the commonplace things of life and
of insolvable problems in a world where everyone thinks he can have good
helpings of normal happiness. An artist to whom nothing is signiﬁcant except
his own creative activity and who seeks peace, unpossessive love and dis-

interested appreciation, is caught in the very situation he tries to avoid, because he lives in a world which is continuously making demands. He marries
twice. Each of his wives love him and wish to help him but also desire
their love to be returned.

This is the chief cause of disharmony and the artist,

like a bird in a cage, trying to escape, ﬁnds himself unable to do so.

j‘AMIA DRAMATIC SOCIETY
The jamia Dramatic Society was formally constituted in 1946 as a
consummation of dramatic activity extending over twenty years. The Society
believes that the theatre, where youth ﬁnds a healthy avenue for self expression,
has immense educational potentialities. It also recognizes fully well the vital
part the Theatre can play in the development of community life, in the educational
and cultural institutions. Hence in view of all the educative value drama has,
the Society has been encouraging dramatic activities in the different educational
departments of the famia Millia.

The Society, since its inception in 19—10, has produced a number of plays.“Khana fungi”, “Heroine lei Talash”, “Agra Bazar”, “Habch Khatoon”-—
which have been appreciated by Delhi audiences. Encouraged by patrons of
drama, the Society takes pride in presenting “Doosri Sham” to a wider public.
