THE UNITY THEATRE

BONAVEN'I‘URE written by CHARLOTTE HASTINGS

The Convent of Our Lady of Rheims in the Fen country is thrown open
to give sanctuary to the villagers who are rendered homeless through ﬂoods
and the breaking of the Great Dyke. Roads are impassable and there is no
telephone cormnunication. A car is stranded on the road from London to
Norwich, the occupants Melling and Miss Pierce—two prison warders—and
their prisoner, Sarat Carn, who has been convicted of the murder of her brother,

are forced to stay at the Convent. Sarat’s appeal has just been dismissed and
she is being taken to Norwich Prison where the death penalty is to be imposed.
Sister Mary Bonaventure, the Matron of the Convent Hospital, is greatly drawn
to Sarat and feels convinced that she did not commit the crime, although the
evidence against her is damning to a frightening degree. Against the wishes
of the Reverend Mother, Sister Mary persists with her efforts to help Sarat
and just before the police launch arrives from Norwich she is able “through
a little luck and a great deal of faith” to prove Sarat’s innocence and force a
confession from the murderer.

THE UNITY THEATRE
In the summer of 1.95] a small group of people, including professors and
lecturers, after having met religiously at a small table at the University Coffee
House, decided to call itself the “Unity Theatre”. Their aim was to experiment
with new and difﬁcult plays and to share this knowledge with all theatre lovers
in Delhi.

The Winter of 1951 brought the Unity Theatre’s maiden production before
the footlights—RonaldDuncan’s “ THE EAGLE HAS TWO HEADS” which was
widely acclaimed by critics as a land mark in the history of the Delhi amateur stage.
One aim was fulﬁlled—the interest was revived among the capital’s theatre
enthusiasts to come and share the love of the theatre with them.
