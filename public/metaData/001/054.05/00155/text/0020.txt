LITTLE THEATRE GROUP
In December 1954, the Group sponsored a visit to the Indian capital by
Geoffrey Kendal and his International Theatre Company, “Shakespeareana”.
Further visits have been organized by the Group in 1955, (ten days), and 1956,
(Two weeks).
Among the Group productions have been the Chinese play, “The Circle of
Chal ”, the French plays, “Ardele” and “Crime Passionel” and Hindustani
adaptations of “The Master Builder”, “The Doll’s House”, “Government
Inspector” and “The Three Sisters”. The arena stage has been used in three
productions and the Group’s recent production of the Sanskrit classic “Ratnavali”
in English was the only amateur production included in the Sangeet Natale
Akadami’s ofﬁcial programme for delegates to the UNESCO General Assembly.

At present the Group is ﬁnalising its plans to set up a Theatre Arts Training
Centre in the capital and in this connection plans to build also a self contained
modern theatre with a completely flexible and fully equipped stage.
In addition the Group holds regular meetings when plays are read, lectures
given, ﬁlms shown or other activities held and, since fuly 1955, has regularly

published its monthly news bulletin, “Theatre News”.

In addition to the “The Teahouse of the August Moon” (Fine Arts Theatre,
March 26th, 27th, and 28th), the Group is shortly sponsoring a recital of Bharata
Natya and Mohini Attam by Roshan Vajifdar (Sapru House, March 3nd and
3rd), a Hindi adaptation of “The Diary of a Scoundrel” (early April) and
“The
Salt March”, a German play (English translation), in which Mahatma
Gandhi’s
Salt March to Dandi has been used as the setting. Another visit by “S
hakespeareana” is also planned soon.
