PRAGATI THEATRE UNIT

PAANCH BARE

written by VIRENDRA KASHYAP

The story revolves round an artist, an actor, a writer and a singer who,
each, feel that they have succeeded in achieving the ideal through the medium
in which they work and consequently bask smueg in the warmth of self satis-

faction and preach their way of life to others. Then there moves into the
picture another being. He admires them all equally and thinks their achievements of great importance and value to the world. Who is this person and
in what way has he contributed to the welfare and glory of humanity डे'
