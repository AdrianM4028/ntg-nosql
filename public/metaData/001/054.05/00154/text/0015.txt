THEATRE

WORKSHOP

Theatre workshop was founded in the summer of 1958 by
two theatre
enthusiasts whose primary purpose was to ﬁnd
out if a theatre group in Delhi,
untrammelled by too much committee control, could stage more
than two '
productions in a season.
In its ﬁrst season it staged no less than six producrions. Its first
production, the Queen’s Dilemma , was staged for private Consumption.
lts ﬁrst
public production was "Waiting for Godot" — an extremely difﬁcultplayto
prod u ce .
…

In the ﬁrst year or two of its existence, Theatre Wo
rkshop was very
fortunate because Delhi was then blessed with a number of ex
cellent producers.

Chris Rosenfeld. Alfred Hall. Michael Stephens, are three ta
lented producers
no longer with us, whom many in Delhi will remember with gratitude for
their
excellent productions.
Among the many plays which Theatre Workshop has staged, the mest
memorable will probably be “Witness for the Prosecution" “The VVahz of the

TOreadors”. ”The Diary of Anne Frank", "Tea and Sympathy”, "You Touched

Me”, “The Queen and the Rebels.”
