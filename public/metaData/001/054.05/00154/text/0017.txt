Unfortunately further activities of the Group came to a sudden
standstill on account of partition of India. As rnOSt of the members had migratedthe headquarters of the Group were subsequently shifted to Delhi in April, 1948

In spite of having lost its ﬁnancial assets, the Group carried on its
formal activities and presented its second major production ‘Teen Behnain”
