Krishna reminds him of his vow. Breaking all the
rules of the war, Bhim strikes Duryodhan below

his waist and thus vanquishes him.

Gandhariâ€™s curse
A bitter Gandhari curses Krishna that though he
is Lord-incarnate, he would die as a mortal, as

he is responsible for leaving her bereft of any of
her sons.

Krishna thani
Krishna poignantly reassures her that as long as
he is alive she would not be childless. For every
warrior who died was Him. It is He who is born
age after age to re-establish Dharrna on earth.
