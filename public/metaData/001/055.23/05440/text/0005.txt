coloured in the hues of r'agas such as ’ Des’,
’Khamaj’, ’Mian ki Malhar’ and ’Kedar’, the
music differs from my early works in its
emphasis on taal as much as on melody, to be
adapted for dance. The use of pace and metrical
space has fascinated me, drawing me again and

again into working with the dancers. And
Krishna-Katha has given me ample opportunities
of working with unusual thekas, metres or

chhandas and syncopation. Whereas the first
half of the production relies heavily on medieval
text and musical forms, the script for the second

half demanded that I bring a sense of theatre and
drama into the music. The production also
provided me with my first opportunity of
working with quadrophonic sound, commonly
known as ’surround sound’.
I extend my gratitude to all those who have
worked with me and supported me through this
production. I, particularly, thank Mrs Surnitra
Charat Ram, Mrs Shobha Deepak Singh,

Acharya Shri Purushottarn Goswami and Shri
Shrivatsa Goswami without whose blessings this
production could not have been accomplished.
