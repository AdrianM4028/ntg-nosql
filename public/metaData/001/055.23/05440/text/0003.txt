from the Mahabharat. There has been a major
shift in emphasis in the second half. Here, the
story of Krishna which is lesser known is dealt
with at a great length. There has been a
conscious attempt to step out of the grove of
blind faith, and present facts in an artistic and
refined manner, and throw up questions of
relevance. With this end in view, the script in the

second half deals with incidents that open up a
plethora of topics for discussions that are
universal and timeless.
The thrust of the production is to infuse the
epic with aesthetic values and to throw light on
those events that are lesser known, and which
merit attention.

Di rector’s Note
The story of Krishna has been enacted over the
years in all artistic formats. The previous
production of the Kendra fell into similar formats
with minor aesthetic and populist changes. Also,
over the years starting from the Maharaas, events
were added at random, without a cohesive

structure. Every music director and
choreographer came in with his or her inputs.
The production, though thoroughly popular in
appeal, lacked a cohesive thought process. The
same was what transpired with other production
values. Costumes, ornaments and sets were
altered and deleted, with a view on only the

immediate impact.
After the first performance of Krishna, this is
the first time that the focus of the production is
being dealt with in a comprehensive mamer. It
has taken months of research to put up this
production and to understand the complexities
and contradictions that are clearly visible in
Krishna’s life. It is here that the challenge lay. To
deviate from the populist to a production of
refined quality required the kind of inputs that
demand a well thought out and thorough wellknit team of like-minded persons. For this the
Kendra is specially indebted to Shubha Mudgal
not only for composing the soundtrack, but also
for spending a great deal of time and assistance
in the research. ‘Apart from the team of people
