Synopsis
Birth of Krishna
On a night of torrential rainfall, Krishna is born.
He is transported and exchanged with a baby
girl born to Yashoda and Nand at Cokul. Kansa,

Krishna’s uncle unwittingly kills the child
thinking that she might be the one to vanquish
him.

Birth celebrations
Celebrations are on in Cokul as Krishna is born.

Paalna
Yashoda, Krishna’s mother decorates baby
Krishna’s bed with flowers.

Lord Shiva visits Krishna
Krishna is ill and the Lord Shiva visits the baby
Krishna. Yashoda and the gopis are unable to
recognise the Lord with his matted locks and
extraordinary countenance. However, the
moment they realise that he is Lord Shiva, they
pay obeisance to him.

Putna Moksha
A demoness Putna, in the garb of a Copi arrives
at Gokul. She tries to feed the baby Krishna,

who in turn poisons her to death.

The Butter Thief
(Makhan Char and Cheer Hat-an)
The butter thief of Brindavan harasses the gopis.
As they complain to Yashoda, she is about to
punish him, and she sees the Universe in his
mouth, and realises his Divinity. While they go
bathing by the riverside, Krishna steals the

clothes of the unsuspecting gopis. After much
beseeching, Krishna returns their garments. The
gopis realise that the surrender to the Lord must
be complete.

Kaliya
Krishna plays with his friends at the riverside.
Their peaceful pastoral existence is disturbed by
a snake-worshipping tribe led by Kaliya. Kaliya
is humbled by Krishna and the tribe is sent away
to a distant land.
