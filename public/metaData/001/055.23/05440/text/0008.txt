Goverdhan
On the day of Indra Puja, Krishna decides that in
place of Indra, the Mount Covardhan should be
worshipped as it provides them with food and
fodder. An enraged Indra sends down floods to

Cokul. Krishna as the saviour gives protection to
the inhabitants of Brindavan.
Radha-Krishna meet
As Krishna lifts the mountain, he spots Radha for
the first time. She becomes his divine consort
and they cease to have entities of one without
the other.
Raas

It is the night of full moon. The call of the flute
lures the gopis from their tasks and they are
magnetically attracted to Krishna. Krishna
multiplies his form so that each gopi feels that
she is dancing with the Lord.

Maan Leela
During the Raas, Radha and Krishna disappear.
The gopis see two pairs of footprints and then
one. They assume that Krishna must have
carried Radha. Suddenly, they see Radha sitting
alone. She tells the gopis as to how by her
excessive expectations and pride, Krishna had
left her bereft.
Maharaas

Radha and the gopis begin lamenting for
Krishna. So moved is Krishna by their feverish
wait, that he returns in his multiplied form and
continues the Maharaas.

Krishna’s departure for Mathura
Akrur arrives to fetch Krishna so that he may kill
Kansa — the reason for which he is born as the
‘
Lord-incarnate.
Kansa Vadh
Krishna arrives at Mathura and kills the demon

king, Kansa.
