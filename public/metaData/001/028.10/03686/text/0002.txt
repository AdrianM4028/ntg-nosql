‘heatre has always been at the mercy of
sponsors and their concerns over it being
non-lucrative. For the longest time, theatre
lovers have been starved of ﬁnery afforded by
West—End and Broadway productions of
our time due to paucity of funds.
DREAMTHEATRE envisages a market where
performing arts will soon be a much—sought—after
property for corporate houses looking to brand
coveted promotions as their own.

r

With performing arts gaining impetus in our
country, the masses await more and more
platforms by way of which they may appreciate
and experience varied art forms.
DREAMTHEATRE proposes to actively
organize and promote such platforms frequently
and abundantly across the country. As
traditionally intended, DREAMTHEATRE
strives to entertain audiences of various ages and
income categories. The ultimate challenge for us is

to take theatre from a speciﬁc local context to the
global arena through traditional as well as
contemporary methods.

Simply put,
DREAMTHEATRE
is a collective of artists from
the world of theatre, television
and film working together on

artistic projects that inspire
and stimulate them.
