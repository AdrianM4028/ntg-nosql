the grandeur, opulence and the underbelly
of this ancient modern metropolis.
CITY OF DJINNS— traces Delhi not just

through the stories of great rulers,
kingdoms, wars and civilizations but also
through the eyes of its myriad people, its
local traditions, oral narratives, forgotten
tale. Understanding subaltern tales of the
capital, the traditionally silent groups, and

marginal artists through an epic-like and
grand canvas. Historical episodes take

form with the Mati-Ghar monument at the
Indira Gandhi National Center for Arts as
backdrop, showcasing milestones in the

turbulent and glorious past of Delhi.
Come and get transported into an

experiential zone of sights, sounds and
smells with live Suﬁ Qawwali, live acts and
a 'Dilli Bazaar'. CITY OF DJINNS- a

breathtaking production welcomes you to
re—discover Delhi's crumbling ruins and
monumental splendor in the midst of
contemporary development and state of
the art infrastructure. Enjoy Delhi cultural
landscape as you dig deeper into the

history of Delhi and obviously of India.
Experience a sense of awe as you stroll
through wide avenues, carved corridors,

shrines, abandoned havelis, streets of
Chandni Chowk ...all even without moving
from your seat.
City of Djinns is 'not just another play' but
an evening to cherish and a cultural
experience to savor for a long long time...
