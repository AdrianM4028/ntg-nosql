About the Venue

Mati-Ghar
(Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts)

11 New Delhi, CITY OF DJINNS is
mounted at the Mati Ghar (Indira
Gandhi National Center for the Arts);

a breathtaking property spread over 26

acres and located right next to India Gate.
This structure was built in 1990 for the
exhibition Kala (Time). It is a unique
example of application of sustainable
building technologies. The design of the
building represents three most signiÔ¨Åcant

attributes of time: cyclicity by its circular
form; arrow of time by the .top cylindrical
diameter terminating at two small domes

and spiral of time through two staircases
strategically placed.

We thank Indira Gandhi National
Centerfor the Artsfor their support
and Mr. A.N. Jha, Joint Secretary,
IGNCA and Sabiha Anjum Zaidi,

Programme Directorfor their kind
participation
