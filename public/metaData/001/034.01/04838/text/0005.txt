ABOUT THE PLAY:
Throughout history 'it has been a continuous struggle for women in different societies to
achieve social, political, and legal rights - be it in ancient Greece where women were not
considered full citizens or in the present times where women are still struggling for their
rights and an equal status in the political, social, legal and economic processes. The long

drawn struggles have yielded some results. But- it was only as recent as in 2005 that Kuwait

extended suffrage to women and that African Union adopted Maputo Protocol which
guarantees comprehensive rights to women.
