कर्ण भारमू
(महाकवि भास के संस्तुत नाटक पर आधारित)
(Based on the great Sanskrit playwright Bhasa's Sanskrit drama)

is a direct approach towards the identity crisis of an individual
in the modern world. Modem civilisation‘s dehurnanising
inﬂuences in human society are crystallised through the
agonies and travails faced by Kama, who was a victim of
class and caste discriminations- the evils that beset the
modern society, putting heavy impediments on the growth of
an individual.

Then again through ﬂash back the episode of how
Parashuram cursed him, that the weapons and their technique that he had learnt from the sage would fail him in his
hour of need, is depicted. Kama, a Kshstriya by birth, learnt
under the feet of Parashuram under the concealed identity as
a Brahmin disciple.

Another gripping episode shows how Kama gives away
his invincible “Kawach and Kundala" to Indra, who begs him
in the guise of a Brahmin.
Thus bereft of his Kawacha and Kundala and the curse
