Kathak originated in the temples of Rajasthan and UttarPradesh as
the art of the Kathaks, the story-tellers who interpreted episodes from
mythology in song and abhinaya using a great deal of gestural language.
During the course of its evolutiOn Kathak migrated from the temple to the

court of the Rajahs where it assumed a secular colour highlighting the
popular aspect of the art. Later when this art was patronised by the Muslim
rulers it developed a more decorative and sensuous form. Along with this,
speed in rendering the dance sequences became an essential part laying

emphasis on the fast footwork. Finally in the last century a rcvitalised
form of Kathak was established by pioneers like Thakur Prasad and Maharaj
Bindadin. Thus today in its true form Kathak is rich in Nritt. Nritya and
Natya having passed through two great Cultures that inﬂuenced our country.
The rendering of Kathak varied, as we know, in the successive stages

of history to suit the tastes of its patrons.

These phases are depicted here

in a series of dance sequences.
