Makarand comforts Madhav and says :

How can I oﬂer solace to you, my friend
Verin you are stricken by the ﬂowery arrows of Kama !
What a happy augury .’
You and Malati havefallen in love.
Scene II

Malati, in a state of restlessness, awaits the arrival of the Sakhi who
has gone to fetch the garland from Madhav. In the meantime she
engages herself in drawing a picture of her beloved Madhav. Another
Sakhi snatches it and teases her.
Malati wonders ;

What happened to the Sakhi
Who had gone to fetch the garland for me.
Her compamon tries to divert Malati's attention by making her dance.
