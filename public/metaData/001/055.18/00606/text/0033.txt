to offer

a human sacriﬁce, and Malati is chosen

as the Victim.

Kapala-

kundala, the female disciple of Aghor Gama. has all in readiness, and they
are about to irnrnolate Malati when Madhav, who was there to propitiate in
some occult way the spirits, appears on the scene and rescues her. Madhav
kills Aghor Ghanta. Kapalakundala escapes swearing vengeance.

In the meantime Bhurivasu was forced to consent to Malati’s marriage
with Nandan, the King’s favourite.

It was announced that the marriage of

Malati and Nandan would be celebrated in the evening and, according to

the custom, Malati was to go just before the marriage to the temple and
worship the Goddess. Kamandaki decided to carry out her well conceived
plans. She asked Madhav to go to the temple before hand and remain

hidden there. Malati who is quite in ignorance of what was to follow,
approaches the temple.
Kamandaki helps Madhav to elope with Malati to a pre-arranged
place and solemnise the marriage. Kapalakundala, who has been longing
to avenge the death of Aghor Ghanta, ﬁnds an opportunity to pounce upon

Malati and leads her off with the intention of killing her. There is general
gloom and lamentation. But Kamandaki’s pupil, Saudamini, who apparently had become an adept in occult sciences rescues Malati from the clutches
of Kapalakundala and restores her sorrowing relatives.

Only the main plot of Bhavabhuti’s romantic play has been taken for
adaptation for this dance-drama and the by-plot centering round
Makaranda
‘ and Madayantika has been left out.

Fragrance ofﬂowers
Floats over the balmy breeze
Trees—Panas, Baku], Vat, Kadamb

Koel and Shuk sing enchanting melodies of spring
And Suras, Asuras and people all,

With ﬂaming passion in their hearts,
Rejoice, in ecstatic abandon,
The advent of spring.
Fair maidens
