a: few puppet plays . such as “Prithviraj Sanyukta", “Dhola Maru" and
“Jhansi ki Rani". - The Kendra manufactures its own puppets and is
zealously experimenting with new forms and techniques. In this context it
is gratifying to note that our craftsmen, have succeeded in investing the
puppets with motions of eyes, lips and wrists which previously they lacked.
A great deal remains to be done.

By far the most severe handicap

from which the Kendra suffers is the lack of its own premises. The growth
and development 01 the college is seriously hampered by the absence of
hOStel accommodation.

As regards ﬁnancial resources the Kendra would like to see a state
of'aﬂiairs emerge when its existence is ensured by something more than mere
ad hoc receipts.

It is to be earnestly hoped that the members of the Kendra

as well as those deeply and vitally interested in our country’s cultural revival
will give their whole-hearted support to the Bharatiya Kala Kendra and its
activities,

The Institution is deeply grateful to the Prime Minister Pt. Jawahar
Lal Nehru, the Ministry of Scientiﬁc Research & Cultural Affairs, the
Sangeet Natak Akadami, the Handicrafts Board of the Government of India,
Delhi State & Delhi Municipal Corporation for their patronage without
which the Institution could not have achieved its aims.
