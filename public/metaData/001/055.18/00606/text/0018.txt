CLASSICAL BA LL ETS

The Bharatiya Kala Kendra is the ﬁrst to stage classical dance dramas
based on the Kathak style of dancing with music which is also
e l a s s i cal .

Having realised the potentialities offered by the Kathalc technique,
the Kendra started experiments in utilising its ‘Natya’ element by
using it as a story-telling medium and presenting it in a new lorm.
As the success of these dance-dramas largely depends on the music. .

great care has been taken in the choice of ragas and talas to provide
the proper atmosphere in keeping with the changing moods of the
theme, It is gratifying to ﬁnd that the outcome of these efforts is a
harmonious blending of melody, rhythm and technique in their purest
forms. Occasional sprinkling of folk tunes and dances has however
been adopted to suit the scenes. As far as possible the Kendra has tried
to keep the decor conventional, and costumes authentic keeping in mind
the classical background 01 the productions. it has also restriCIed the .
choice of themes to classics and such themes that suit the Kathak
medium.

This is a bold venture and is an entirely new departure from the old
form of presentation and is a big step towards the renaissance of
classical dance and music.

It is heartening to note that the shows staged at Calcutta. Lucknow,
Bombay, Hyderabad and Ujjain have received rousing appreciation
both front the press and the public.

The Kendra is greatly indebted to the Directors of Music and Dance,
the well-known Dagar Bros. and Birju Maharaj, for their untiring
efforts, and to the students for their co-operation and hard work in
making the producrions a success.

The Kendra is also indebted to Sur-Singar Samsad. Shri Kantilal Shah,
Mr. Lakhia and all the advertisers and art lovers who have helped the
Kendra to organise their shows in Bombay.
