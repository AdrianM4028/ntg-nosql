“Bahar a rahi”

(traditional Quawali sung in celebration of Basant, the festival of
Spring).
Scene I

Baradari : The ‘Shahnai' heralds the entry of Nawab Wajid Ali
Shah. Groups of dancers come with customary olferings of
‘Basant Mubarak’ to their King and patron. This is followed by
the dance of Rasdharis, after which the dancers receive gifts
from the King as tokens of his appreciation.
Scene I I

The Nawab’s Seraglio :

His Begums entertain

him to a Mushaira and later one of them lulls

him to sleep with a thumri (composed by the
King) rendered in ‘bhav’. He wanders in the

_ realm of fantasy and sees ‘Parees’ in the Court
of Indra, and the dance of Radha and Krishna. (This dream'
sequence inspires the Nawab to compose “Indra Sabha”,
“Rahas” and “Parion ka Rahasya”).
