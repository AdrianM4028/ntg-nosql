who perform a novel composition—the dance of elements ; but
the king demands more novelty. So the Guru himself dances to
a ‘dhrupad’ accompanied by the best musicians and ace Pakha-

wajiya of the Court. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah applauds the
superb performance, but it fails to satisfy him, as his dream still
lingers in his mind. He decides to recapture it in the form of a
ballet called “RAHAS”, depicting the story of Radha & Krishna.
