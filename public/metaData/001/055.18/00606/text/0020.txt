compositions have become classics in the world of music.

In the midst of political conﬂagration of a collapsing kingdom
he did not lose the spirit of a true artist. He remained unperturbed in his
devotion to art. The most critical moment of his We moved him to corn-

pose the beautiful and touching song "Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Hi Jae”.
It was the outpouring of his heart when he had to leave his beloved city of
Lucknow to go into exile shorn of his glory and majesty. He may pale

patron of arts.

vibrations of music he created.
